### [1] [Randomized-MLP Regularization Improves Domain Adaptation and Interpretability in DINOv2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05509)
*Joel Valdivia Ortega,Lorenz Lamm,Franziska Eckardt,Benedikt Schworm,Marion Jasnin,Tingying Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RMLP regularization improves Vision Transformer interpretability and performance by encouraging semantically aligned representations through contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers often repurpose low-informative patch tokens, reducing interpretability of attention and feature maps, especially in medical imaging where domain shifts degrade both performance and transparency.

Method: Introduce Randomized-MLP (RMLP) regularization, a contrastive learning-based method that encourages more semantically aligned representations when fine-tuning DINOv2 to medical and natural image modalities.

Result: RMLP improves or maintains downstream performance while producing more interpretable attention maps across both medical and natural image domains.

Conclusion: RMLP regularization enhances ViT-based models' interpretability and provides mathematical insights into contrastive learning mechanisms.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs), such as DINOv2, achieve strong performance across domains but often repurpose low-informative patch tokens in ways that reduce the interpretability of attention and feature maps. This challenge is especially evident in medical imaging, where domain shifts can degrade both performance and transparency. In this paper, we introduce Randomized-MLP (RMLP) regularization, a contrastive learning-based method that encourages more semantically aligned representations. We use RMLPs when fine-tuning DINOv2 to both medical and natural image modalities, showing that it improves or maintains downstream performance while producing more interpretable attention maps. We also provide a mathematical analysis of RMLPs, offering insights into its role in enhancing ViT-based models and advancing our understanding of contrastive learning.

### [2] [Token Is All You Need: Cognitive Planning through Sparse Intent Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05540)
*Shiyao Sang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper challenges the need for exhaustive scene modeling in autonomous driving, showing that minimal semantically rich tokens are sufficient for effective planning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on nuPlan benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the long-standing assumption that exhaustive scene modeling is required for high-performance end-to-end autonomous driving, and to show that sparse semantic representations can outperform traditional world-model approaches.

Method: Uses perception-informed BEV representations with sparse semantic tokens, conditioning trajectory decoding on predicted future tokens, and explores temporal fuzziness for adaptive planning.

Result: Achieves 0.548 m ADE without future prediction (comparable to 0.75 m on nuScenes), and 0.479 m ADE with future token conditioning (12.6% improvement). Explicit reconstruction loss offers no benefit and may degrade performance.

Conclusion: The "token is all you need" principle represents a paradigm shift from reconstructing the world to understanding it, enabling cognitively inspired systems that plan through imagination rather than reaction.

Abstract: We challenge the long-standing assumption that exhaustive scene modeling is required for high-performance end-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD). Unlike world-model approaches that rely on computationally intensive future scene generation or vision-language-action (VLA) systems constrained by Markov assumptions, we show that a minimal set of semantically rich tokens is sufficient for effective planning. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark (720 scenarios, over 11,000 samples) using perception-informed BEV representations yield three key findings: (1) even without future prediction, our sparse representation achieves 0.548 m ADE, comparable to or surpassing prior methods reporting around 0.75 m on nuScenes; (2) conditioning trajectory decoding on predicted future tokens reduces ADE to 0.479 m, a 12.6% improvement over current-state baselines; and (3) explicit reconstruction loss offers no benefit and may degrade performance under reliable perception inputs. Notably, we observe the emergence of temporal fuzziness, where the model adaptively attends to task-relevant semantics rather than aligning rigidly to fixed timestamps, providing a cognitive advantage for planning under uncertainty. Our "token is all you need" principle marks a paradigm shift from reconstructing the world to understanding it, laying a foundation for cognitively inspired systems that plan through imagination rather than reaction.

*Advait Thakur,Khushi Khanchandani,Akshita Shetty,Chaitravi Reddy,Ritisa Behera*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a holistic AI platform that combines OCR, deep learning, LLMs, and graph analytics to overcome limitations of traditional OCR systems in handling variant invoice layouts, handwritten text, and low-quality scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional OCR systems struggle with variant invoice layouts, handwritten text, and low-quality scans due to strong template dependencies that limit flexibility across different document structures. Newer approaches using deep learning and LLMs show promise but need integration for optimal performance.

Method: The proposed solution combines OCR technology with deep learning models (CNNs and Transformers), Large Language Models (LLMs) for entity recognition and semantic comprehension, and graph analytics in a hybrid architecture. This includes Visual Named Entity Recognition (NER) capabilities for extraction from invoice images.

Result: The holistic AI platform achieves unprecedented extraction quality and consistency, with greater contextual sensitivity and much higher accuracy rates than older approaches, while supporting complex contextual relationship mapping without direct programming specification.

Conclusion: Hybrid architectures that blend OCR technology with LLMs and other AI components provide maximum scalability and minimal human intervention for document processing, representing the future direction for robust invoice extraction systems.

Abstract: Conventional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems are challenged by
variant invoice layouts, handwritten text, and low- quality scans, which are
often caused by strong template dependencies that restrict their flexibility
across different document structures and layouts. Newer solutions utilize
advanced deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as
well as Transformers, and domain-specific models for better layout analysis and
accuracy across various sections over varied document types. Large Language
Models (LLMs) have revolutionized extraction pipelines at their core with
sophisticated entity recognition and semantic comprehension to support complex
contextual relationship mapping without direct programming specification.
Visual Named Entity Recognition (NER) capabilities permit extraction from
invoice images with greater contextual sensitivity and much higher accuracy
rates than older approaches. Existing industry best practices utilize hybrid
architectures that blend OCR technology and LLM for maximum scalability and
minimal human intervention. This work introduces a holistic Artificial
Intelligence (AI) platform combining OCR, deep learning, LLMs, and graph
analytics to achieve unprecedented extraction quality and consistency.

### [4] [In-Context-Learning-Assisted Quality Assessment Vision-Language Models for Metal Additive Manufacturing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05551)
*Qiaojie Zheng,Jiucai Zhang,Xiaoli Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-language models with in-context learning can assess additive manufacturing quality without large datasets, achieving accuracy comparable to traditional ML while providing interpretable rationales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional vision-based quality assessment requires expensive data collection and model training. VLMs offer a data-efficient alternative by leveraging reasoning capabilities and eliminating the need for large application-specific datasets.

Method: Used in-context learning with VLMs (Gemini-2.5-flash and Gemma3:27b) to provide application-specific knowledge, explored different sampling strategies for optimal configuration with limited samples in wire-laser direct energy deposition processes.

Result: ICL-assisted VLMs achieved quality classification accuracies similar to traditional ML models using minimal samples, and generated human-interpretable rationales for improved transparency.

Conclusion: ICL-assisted VLMs can effectively address application-specific manufacturing tasks with limited data, providing both high accuracy and valid supporting rationales for enhanced decision transparency.

Abstract: Vision-based quality assessment in additive manufacturing often requires dedicated machine learning models and application-specific datasets. However, data collection and model training can be expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we leverage vision-language models' (VLMs') reasoning capabilities to assess the quality of printed parts and introduce in-context learning (ICL) to provide VLMs with necessary application-specific knowledge and demonstration samples. This method eliminates the requirement for large application-specific datasets for training models. We explored different sampling strategies for ICL to search for the optimal configuration that makes use of limited samples. We evaluated these strategies on two VLMs, Gemini-2.5-flash and Gemma3:27b, with quality assessment tasks in wire-laser direct energy deposition processes. The results show that ICL-assisted VLMs can reach quality classification accuracies similar to those of traditional machine learning models while requiring only a minimal number of samples. In addition, unlike traditional classification models that lack transparency, VLMs can generate human-interpretable rationales to enhance trust. Since there are no metrics to evaluate their interpretability in manufacturing applications, we propose two metrics, knowledge relevance and rationale validity, to evaluate the quality of VLMs' supporting rationales. Our results show that ICL-assisted VLMs can address application-specific tasks with limited data, achieving relatively high accuracy while also providing valid supporting rationales for improved decision transparency.

### [5] [EVLP:Learning Unified Embodied Vision-Language Planner with Reinforced Supervised Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05553)
*Xinyan Cai,Shiguang Wu,Dafeng Chi,Yuzheng Zhuang,Xingyue Quan,Jianye Hao,Qiang Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EVLP is a unified multimodal generation framework that integrates textual reasoning and visual generation for long-horizon manipulation tasks through dynamic pretraining and reinforced alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods fail to provide a unified framework for multimodal planning, leading to inconsistencies in complex embodied long-horizon manipulation tasks that require synergistic integration of textual logical reasoning and visual-spatial imagination.

Method: Three key components: 1) Unified multimodal generation framework integrating semantic and spatial features with learnable cross-modal attention; 2) Dynamic perception pretraining with bidirectional alignment using inverse and forward dynamics tasks; 3) Reinforced supervised fine-tuning with reinforce loss to align spatial logic between text and images.

Result: The approach enables coordinated language-visual modeling and spatio-aware multimodal planning capabilities for long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: EVLP provides an innovative solution for multimodal unified generation that effectively addresses the challenge of inconsistent multimodal planning in complex embodied manipulation tasks.

Abstract: In complex embodied long-horizon manipulation tasks, effective task decomposition and execution require synergistic integration of textual logical reasoning and visual-spatial imagination to ensure efficient and accurate operation. Current methods fail to adopt a unified generation framework for multimodal planning, lead to inconsistent in multimodal planning. To address this challenge, we present \textbf{EVLP (Embodied Vision-Language Planner)}, an innovative multimodal unified generation framework that jointly models linguistic reasoning and visual generation. Our approach achieves multimodal planning for long-horizon tasks through a novel training pipeline incorporating dynamic pretraining and reinforced alignment. Our core innovations consist of three key components: \textbf{1) Unified Multimodal Generation Framework}: For understanding, We integrate semantic information with spatial features to provide comprehensive visual perception. For generation, we directly learn the joint distribution of discrete images for one-step visual synthesis, enabling coordinated language-visual modeling through learnable cross-modal attention mechanisms. \textbf{2) Dynamic Perception Pretraining}: We propose a bidirectional dynamic alignment strategy employing inverse dynamics tasks and forward dynamics tasks, effectively strengthening multimodal correlations within a unified feature space. \textbf{3) Reinforced Supervised Fine-Tuning}: While conducting instruction-based fine-tuning in the unified generation space, we construct a reinforce loss to align the spatial logic between textual actions and generated images, enabling the model to acquire spatio-awared multimodal planning capabilities.

### [6] [MCFCN: Multi-View Clustering via a Fusion-Consensus Graph Convolutional Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05554)
*Chenping Pei,Fadi Dornaika,Jingjun Bi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCFCN is a multi-view clustering method that uses a fusion-consensus graph convolutional network to learn consensus graphs end-to-end, addressing noise issues in existing methods and improving clustering performance through similarity and feature alignment losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-view clustering methods neglect inherent topological structures, are susceptible to noise in graph inputs, have insufficient cross-view consistency consideration, struggle with hard-to-distinguish samples, and suffer from disjointed optimization processes in graph construction.

Method: Proposes MCFCN with view feature fusion model and Unified Graph Structure Adapter (UGA), using Similarity Matrix Alignment Loss (SMAL) and Feature Representation Alignment Loss (FRAL) to optimize view-specific graphs while preserving cross-view topological consistency and promoting intra-class edge construction.

Result: MCFCN demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on eight multi-view benchmark datasets, with effectiveness verified through extensive qualitative and quantitative implementations.

Conclusion: The proposed MCFCN method successfully addresses limitations of existing multi-view clustering approaches by learning consensus graphs end-to-end and achieves superior clustering performance through unified graph structure adaptation and alignment losses.

Abstract: Existing Multi-view Clustering (MVC) methods based on subspace learning focus on consensus representation learning while neglecting the inherent topological structure of data. Despite the integration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into MVC, their input graph structures remain susceptible to noise interference. Methods based on Multi-view Graph Refinement (MGRC) also have limitations such as insufficient consideration of cross-view consistency, difficulty in handling hard-to-distinguish samples in the feature space, and disjointed optimization processes caused by graph construction algorithms. To address these issues, a Multi-View Clustering method via a Fusion-Consensus Graph Convolutional Network (MCFCN) is proposed. The network learns the consensus graph of multi-view data in an end-to-end manner and learns effective consensus representations through a view feature fusion model and a Unified Graph Structure Adapter (UGA). It designs Similarity Matrix Alignment Loss (SMAL) and Feature Representation Alignment Loss (FRAL). With the guidance of consensus, it optimizes view-specific graphs, preserves cross-view topological consistency, promotes the construction of intra-class edges, and realizes effective consensus representation learning with the help of GCN to improve clustering performance. MCFCN demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on eight multi-view benchmark datasets, and its effectiveness is verified by extensive qualitative and quantitative implementations. The code will be provided at https://github.com/texttao/MCFCN.

### [7] [Compressing Multi-Task Model for Autonomous Driving via Pruning and Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05557)
*Jiayuan Wang,Q. M. Jonathan Wu,Ning Zhang,Katsuya Suto,Lei Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a multi-task model compression framework combining task-aware safe pruning and feature-level knowledge distillation to reduce parameters by 32.7% while maintaining real-time performance and minimal accuracy loss for autonomous driving perception tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-task learning for panoptic perception in autonomous driving faces deployment challenges due to increasing model parameters and complexity on on-board devices.

Method: Combines task-aware safe pruning (Taylor-based channel importance with gradient conflict penalty) with task head-agnostic distillation that transfers intermediate backbone and encoder features from teacher to student model.

Result: Achieves 32.7% parameter reduction with negligible segmentation accuracy loss and minor detection decrease (-1.2% Recall, -1.8% mAP50), maintaining 32.7 FPS real-time performance on BDD100K dataset.

Conclusion: Combining pruning and knowledge distillation provides an effective compression solution for multi-task panoptic perception in autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems rely on panoptic perception to jointly handle object detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line segmentation. Although multi-task learning is an effective way to integrate these tasks, its increasing model parameters and complexity make deployment on on-board devices difficult. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-task model compression framework that combines task-aware safe pruning with feature-level knowledge distillation. Our safe pruning strategy integrates Taylor-based channel importance with gradient conflict penalty to keep important channels while removing redundant and conflicting channels. To mitigate performance degradation after pruning, we further design a task head-agnostic distillation method that transfers intermediate backbone and encoder features from a teacher to a student model as guidance. Experiments on the BDD100K dataset demonstrate that our compressed model achieves a 32.7% reduction in parameters while segmentation performance shows negligible accuracy loss and only a minor decrease in detection (-1.2% for Recall and -1.8% for mAP50) compared to the teacher. The compressed model still runs at 32.7 FPS in real-time. These results show that combining pruning and knowledge distillation provides an effective compression solution for multi-task panoptic perception.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes FilletRec, a lightweight graph neural network using pose-invariant intrinsic geometric features for automated recognition and simplification of fillet features in CAD models, achieving superior accuracy and generalization with high model efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated recognition and simplification of fillet features in CAD models is critical for CAE analysis but remains challenging. Traditional rule-based methods lack robustness, while existing deep learning models suffer from poor generalization and low accuracy on complex fillets due to generic design and inadequate training data.

Method: Constructed a large-scale benchmark dataset for fillet recognition and proposed FilletRec, a lightweight graph neural network that uses pose-invariant intrinsic geometric features (such as curvature) to learn fundamental geometric patterns. Integrated with an effective geometric simplification algorithm for automated workflow.

Result: FilletRec surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and generalization, while using only 0.2%-5.4% of the parameters of baseline models, demonstrating high model efficiency. The framework successfully completes automated workflow from recognition to simplification.

Conclusion: The proposed end-to-end, data-driven framework with FilletRec provides an effective solution for automated fillet feature recognition and simplification in CAD models, addressing key limitations of existing methods through pose-invariant geometric features and comprehensive dataset support.

Abstract: Automated recognition and simplification of fillet features in CAD models is critical for CAE analysis, yet it remains an open challenge. Traditional rule-based methods lack robustness, while existing deep learning models suffer from poor generalization and low accuracy on complex fillets due to their generic design and inadequate training data. To address these issues, this paper proposes an end-to-end, data-driven framework specifically for fillet features. We first construct and release a large-scale, diverse benchmark dataset for fillet recognition to address the inadequacy of existing data. Based on it, we propose FilletRec, a lightweight graph neural network. The core innovation of this network is its use of pose-invariant intrinsic geometric features, such as curvature, enabling it to learn more fundamental geometric patterns and thereby achieve high-precision recognition of complex geometric topologies. Experiments show that FilletRec surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and generalization, while using only 0.2\%-5.4\% of the parameters of baseline models, demonstrating high model efficiency. Finally, the framework completes the automated workflow from recognition to simplification by integrating an effective geometric simplification algorithm.

*Yang Liu,Boan Chen,Xiaoguang Zhu,Jing Liu,Peng Sun,Wei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M2S2L is a Mamba-based multi-scale spatial-temporal learning framework for video anomaly detection that achieves high accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for real-world surveillance applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video anomaly detection faces challenges balancing accuracy with efficiency. Traditional methods lack comprehensive spatial-temporal modeling or require excessive computational resources for real-time applications, especially with increasingly complex video content.

Method: Uses hierarchical spatial encoders at multiple granularities and multi-temporal encoders capturing motion dynamics across different time scales. Introduces feature decomposition mechanism for task-specific optimization of appearance and motion reconstruction.

Result: Achieves 98.5%, 92.1%, and 77.9% frame-level AUCs on UCSD Ped2, CUHK Avenue, and ShanghaiTech datasets respectively, with 20.1G FLOPs and 45 FPS inference speed.

Conclusion: M2S2L framework provides robust anomaly detection with high accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for practical surveillance deployment.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is an essential task in the image processing community with prospects in video surveillance, which faces fundamental challenges in balancing detection accuracy with computational efficiency. As video content becomes increasingly complex with diverse behavioral patterns and contextual scenarios, traditional VAD approaches struggle to provide robust assessment for modern surveillance systems. Existing methods either lack comprehensive spatial-temporal modeling or require excessive computational resources for real-time applications. In this regard, we present a Mamba-based multi-scale spatial-temporal learning (M2S2L) framework in this paper. The proposed method employs hierarchical spatial encoders operating at multiple granularities and multi-temporal encoders capturing motion dynamics across different time scales. We also introduce a feature decomposition mechanism to enable task-specific optimization for appearance and motion reconstruction, facilitating more nuanced behavioral modeling and quality-aware anomaly assessment. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that M2S2L framework achieves 98.5%, 92.1%, and 77.9% frame-level AUCs on UCSD Ped2, CUHK Avenue, and ShanghaiTech respectively, while maintaining efficiency with 20.1G FLOPs and 45 FPS inference speed, making it suitable for practical surveillance deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Micro-OD, a benchmark for evaluating vision-language models on biomedical microscopy images, showing that in-context learning enables effective few-shot object detection when annotated data is scarce.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation vision-language models excel on natural images but their utility for biomedical microscopy remains underexplored, especially when large annotated datasets are unavailable.

Method: Introduces Micro-OD benchmark with 252 images across 11 cell types, evaluates 8 VLMs under few-shot conditions, and implements a hybrid FSOD pipeline combining detection head with VLM-based few-shot classifier.

Result: Zero-shot performance is weak due to domain gap, but few-shot support consistently improves detection with marginal gains after six shots. Models with reasoning tokens are better for end-to-end localization, while simpler variants work better for classifying pre-localized crops.

Conclusion: In-context adaptation provides a practical path for microscopy applications, and the benchmark offers a reproducible testbed for advancing open-vocabulary detection in biomedical imaging.

Abstract: Foundation vision-language models (VLMs) excel on natural images, but their utility for biomedical microscopy remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate how in-context learning enables state-of-the-art VLMs to perform few-shot object detection when large annotated datasets are unavailable, as is often the case with microscopic images. We introduce the Micro-OD benchmark, a curated collection of 252 images specifically curated for in-context learning, with bounding-box annotations spanning 11 cell types across four sources, including two in-lab expert-annotated sets. We systematically evaluate eight VLMs under few-shot conditions and compare variants with and without implicit test-time reasoning tokens. We further implement a hybrid Few-Shot Object Detection (FSOD) pipeline that combines a detection head with a VLM-based few-shot classifier, which enhances the few-shot performance of recent VLMs on our benchmark. Across datasets, we observe that zero-shot performance is weak due to the domain gap; however, few-shot support consistently improves detection, with marginal gains achieved after six shots. We observe that models with reasoning tokens are more effective for end-to-end localization, whereas simpler variants are more suitable for classifying pre-localized crops. Our results highlight in-context adaptation as a practical path for microscopy, and our benchmark provides a reproducible testbed for advancing open-vocabulary detection in biomedical imaging.

### [11] [Efficient Online Continual Learning in Sensor-Based Human Activity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05566)
*Yao Zhang,Souza Leite Clayton,Yu Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PTRN-HAR is the first successful application of pre-trained model-based online continual learning to sensor-based human activity recognition, achieving high performance with reduced resource consumption and improved data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing online continual learning approaches for sensor-based HAR are computationally intensive and require extensive labeled samples. Pre-trained model-based approaches show promise but face challenges due to dataset heterogeneity and data scarcity in HAR.

Method: Pre-trains feature extractor using contrastive loss with limited data, freezes it during streaming stage, and replaces dense classification layer with relation module network.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three public datasets, significantly reduces resource consumption while maintaining high performance, and improves data efficiency by reducing labeled data requirements.

Conclusion: PTRN-HAR successfully adapts PTM-based OCL to sensor-based HAR, demonstrating efficient continual learning with limited labeled data and reduced computational resources.

Abstract: Machine learning models for sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) are expected to adapt post-deployment to recognize new activities and different ways of performing existing ones. To address this need, Online Continual Learning (OCL) mechanisms have been proposed, allowing models to update their knowledge incrementally as new data become available while preserving previously acquired information. However, existing OCL approaches for sensor-based HAR are computationally intensive and require extensive labeled samples to represent new changes. Recently, pre-trained model-based (PTM-based) OCL approaches have shown significant improvements in performance and efficiency for computer vision applications. These methods achieve strong generalization capabilities by pre-training complex models on large datasets, followed by fine-tuning on downstream tasks for continual learning. However, applying PTM-based OCL approaches to sensor-based HAR poses significant challenges due to the inherent heterogeneity of HAR datasets and the scarcity of labeled data in post-deployment scenarios. This paper introduces PTRN-HAR, the first successful application of PTM-based OCL to sensor-based HAR. Unlike prior PTM-based OCL approaches, PTRN-HAR pre-trains the feature extractor using contrastive loss with a limited amount of data. This extractor is then frozen during the streaming stage. Furthermore, it replaces the conventional dense classification layer with a relation module network. Our design not only significantly reduces the resource consumption required for model training while maintaining high performance, but also improves data efficiency by reducing the amount of labeled data needed for effective continual learning, as demonstrated through experiments on three public datasets, outperforming the state-of-the-art.

### [12] [Automatic Extraction of Road Networks by using Teacher-Student Adaptive Structural Deep Belief Network and Its Application to Landslide Disaster](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05567)
*Shin Kamada,Takumi Ichimura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed an adaptive DBN with ensemble learning for road detection from aerial images, improving accuracy from 40% to 89% and enabling disaster response applications on edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Road maps contain complex features requiring high representation power, and there's need for rapid disaster response to detect available roads after landslides.

Method: Adaptive structural learning of RBM/DBN with neuron/layer generation algorithms, using Teacher-Student ensemble learning model for road detection from aerial photographs.

Result: Detection accuracy improved from 40.0% to 89.0% on average across seven major cities, and successfully applied to landslide disaster scenarios with fast inference on embedded edge devices.

Conclusion: The adaptive DBN with ensemble learning provides effective road detection with high accuracy and enables practical disaster response applications through lightweight implementation on edge devices.

Abstract: An adaptive structural learning method of Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) and Deep Belief Network (DBN) has been developed as one of prominent deep learning models. The neuron generation-annihilation algorithm in RBM and layer generation algorithm in DBN make an optimal network structure for given input during the learning. In this paper, our model is applied to an automatic recognition method of road network system, called RoadTracer. RoadTracer can generate a road map on the ground surface from aerial photograph data. A novel method of RoadTracer using the Teacher-Student based ensemble learning model of Adaptive DBN is proposed, since the road maps contain many complicated features so that a model with high representation power to detect should be required. The experimental results showed the detection accuracy of the proposed model was improved from 40.0\% to 89.0\% on average in the seven major cities among the test dataset. In addition, we challenged to apply our method to the detection of available roads when landslide by natural disaster is occurred, in order to rapidly obtain a way of transportation. For fast inference, a small size of the trained model was implemented on a small embedded edge device as lightweight deep learning. We reported the detection results for the satellite image before and after the rainfall disaster in Japan.

### [13] [Do Street View Imagery and Public Participation GIS align: Comparative Analysis of Urban Attractiveness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05570)
*Milad Malekzadeh,Elias Willberg,Jussi Torkko,Silviya Korpilo,Kamyar Hasanzadeh,Olle Järv,Tuuli Toivonen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study compares Street View Imagery (SVI) and Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) for capturing urban perceptions, finding only partial alignment between visual-based attractiveness predictions and residents' actual experiences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how different data sources reflect human experiences of urban environments and investigate the comparability between SVI-based perceived attractiveness and residents' reported experiences from PPGIS surveys.

Method: Used participant-rated SVI data and semantic image segmentation to train a machine learning model predicting perceived attractiveness, then compared these predictions to PPGIS-identified attractive/unattractive locations using strict and moderate agreement criteria.

Result: Partial alignment between datasets: moderate threshold agreement was 67% for attractive and 77% for unattractive places, but strict threshold agreement dropped to 27% and 29% respectively. Non-visual cues like noise, traffic, and activity levels significantly contributed to mismatches.

Conclusion: SVI offers a scalable visual proxy for urban perception but cannot fully substitute the experiential richness captured through PPGIS. Both methods are valuable but serve different purposes, requiring an integrated approach to holistically capture urban perceptions.

Abstract: As digital tools increasingly shape spatial planning practices, understanding how different data sources reflect human experiences of urban environments is essential. Street View Imagery (SVI) and Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) represent two prominent approaches for capturing place-based perceptions that can support urban planning decisions, yet their comparability remains underexplored. This study investigates the alignment between SVI-based perceived attractiveness and residents' reported experiences gathered via a city-wide PPGIS survey in Helsinki, Finland. Using participant-rated SVI data and semantic image segmentation, we trained a machine learning model to predict perceived attractiveness based on visual features. We compared these predictions to PPGIS-identified locations marked as attractive or unattractive, calculating agreement using two sets of strict and moderate criteria. Our findings reveal only partial alignment between the two datasets. While agreement (with a moderate threshold) reached 67% for attractive and 77% for unattractive places, agreement (with a strict threshold) dropped to 27% and 29%, respectively. By analysing a range of contextual variables, including noise, traffic, population presence, and land use, we found that non-visual cues significantly contributed to mismatches. The model failed to account for experiential dimensions such as activity levels and environmental stressors that shape perceptions but are not visible in images. These results suggest that while SVI offers a scalable and visual proxy for urban perception, it cannot fully substitute the experiential richness captured through PPGIS. We argue that both methods are valuable but serve different purposes; therefore, a more integrated approach is needed to holistically capture how people perceive urban environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current spatial transcriptomics platforms suffer from low resolution, limiting understanding of spatial gene expression. Super-resolution approaches that integrate histology images with gene expressions face challenges in modeling interactions between these modalities for effective enhancement.

Method: Proposes C3-Diff framework with: 1) refined contrastive learning to extract modal-invariant and content-invariant features, 2) noise-based information augmentation on feature unit hypersphere to overcome low sequencing sensitivity, and 3) dynamic cross-modal imputation-based training to mitigate data scarcity.

Result: Significant improvements over competing methods on four public datasets. Successfully evaluated on downstream tasks including cell type localization, gene expression correlation, and single-cell-level gene expression prediction.

Conclusion: C3-Diff effectively enhances spatial transcriptomics resolution and promotes AI-enhanced biotechnology for biomedical research and clinical applications.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of spatial transcriptomics (ST), i.e., spatial gene expressions, has made it possible to measure gene expression within original tissue, enabling us to discover molecular mechanisms. However, current ST platforms frequently suffer from low resolution, limiting the in-depth understanding of spatial gene expression. Super-resolution approaches promise to enhance ST maps by integrating histology images with gene expressions of profiled tissue spots. However, it remains a challenge to model the interactions between histology images and gene expressions for effective ST enhancement. This study presents a cross-modal cross-content contrastive diffusion framework, called C3-Diff, for ST enhancement with histology images as guidance. In C3-Diff, we firstly analyze the deficiency of traditional contrastive learning paradigm, which is then refined to extract both modal-invariant and content-invariant features of ST maps and histology images. Further, to overcome the problem of low sequencing sensitivity in ST maps, we perform nosing-based information augmentation on the surface of feature unit hypersphere. Finally, we propose a dynamic cross-modal imputation-based training strategy to mitigate ST data scarcity. We tested C3-Diff by benchmarking its performance on four public datasets, where it achieves significant improvements over competing methods. Moreover, we evaluate C3-Diff on downstream tasks of cell type localization, gene expression correlation and single-cell-level gene expression prediction, promoting AI-enhanced biotechnology for biomedical research and clinical applications.

*Ziyang Liu,Kevin Valencia,Justin Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight approach using synthetic supervision to improve text legibility in Text-To-Video models by fine-tuning with text-rich images animated into videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2V models struggle with rendering legible and coherent text in videos, and previous solutions are computationally expensive.

Method: Generate text-rich images using T2I diffusion, animate them into videos with I2V model, then use these synthetic video-prompt pairs to fine-tune pre-trained T2V model Wan2.1 without architectural changes.

Result: Improved short-text legibility and temporal consistency, with emerging structural priors for longer text.

Conclusion: Curated synthetic data and weak supervision offer a practical path toward improving textual fidelity in T2V generation.

Abstract: While Text-To-Video (T2V) models have advanced rapidly, they continue to struggle with generating legible and coherent text within videos. In particular, existing models often fail to render correctly even short phrases or words and previous attempts to address this problem are computationally expensive and not suitable for video generation. In this work, we investigate a lightweight approach to improve T2V diffusion models using synthetic supervision. We first generate text-rich images using a text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model, then animate them into short videos using a text-agnostic image-to-video (I2v) model. These synthetic video-prompt pairs are used to fine-tune Wan2.1, a pre-trained T2V model, without any architectural changes. Our results show improvement in short-text legibility and temporal consistency with emerging structural priors for longer text. These findings suggest that curated synthetic data and weak supervision offer a practical path toward improving textual fidelity in T2V generation.

*Stanislav Selitskiy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-awareness mechanism using a supervising ANN to monitor uncertainty in a CNN ensemble for face recognition, triggering active learning when predictions are untrustworthy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model high-level intelligence traits like reflection and self-correction in narrow ML algorithms, enabling AI to recognize its own uncertainty and seek human help.

Method: A supervising ANN observes activation patterns of a CNN ensemble for face recognition, detects high uncertainty, and triggers active learning by requesting human assistance when needed.

Result: The system can identify when its predictions are untrustworthy and autonomously request human intervention in high-uncertainty scenarios.

Conclusion: Self-awareness mechanisms can be effectively implemented in narrow ML systems to improve reliability through uncertainty detection and active learning.

Abstract: Reflection on one's thought process and making corrections to it if there exists dissatisfaction in its performance is, perhaps, one of the essential traits of intelligence. However, such high-level abstract concepts mandatory for Artificial General Intelligence can be modelled even at the low level of narrow Machine Learning algorithms. Here, we present the self-awareness mechanism emulation in the form of a supervising artificial neural network (ANN) observing patterns in activations of another underlying ANN in a search for indications of the high uncertainty of the underlying ANN and, therefore, the trustworthiness of its predictions. The underlying ANN is a convolutional neural network (CNN) ensemble employed for face recognition and facial expression tasks. The self-awareness ANN has a memory region where its past performance information is stored, and its learnable parameters are adjusted during the training to optimize the performance. The trustworthiness verdict triggers the active learning mode, giving elements of agency to the machine learning algorithm that asks for human help in high uncertainty and confusion conditions.

*Weston Bondurant,Arkaprava Sinha,Hieu Le,Srijan Das,Stephanie Schuckers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffSwap++ is a diffusion-based face swapping method that incorporates 3D facial latent features to improve identity preservation and geometric consistency, outperforming previous approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based face swapping methods suffer from fine-grained artifacts and poor identity preservation, especially under challenging poses and expressions, due to insufficient utilization of 3D facial structure.

Method: Proposes a diffusion-based pipeline that incorporates 3D facial latent features during training, guiding generation with 3D-aware representations and conditioning denoising on both identity embeddings and facial landmarks.

Result: Outperforms prior methods on CelebA, FFHQ, and CelebV-Text datasets in preserving source identity while maintaining target pose and expression, validated through biometric-style evaluation and user studies.

Conclusion: DiffSwap++ demonstrates that incorporating 3D facial structure into diffusion models significantly improves face swapping quality and identity preservation, offering a more effective approach than previous methods.

Abstract: Diffusion-based approaches have recently achieved strong results in face swapping, offering improved visual quality over traditional GAN-based methods. However, even state-of-the-art models often suffer from fine-grained artifacts and poor identity preservation, particularly under challenging poses and expressions. A key limitation of existing approaches is their failure to meaningfully leverage 3D facial structure, which is crucial for disentangling identity from pose and expression. In this work, we propose DiffSwap++, a novel diffusion-based face-swapping pipeline that incorporates 3D facial latent features during training. By guiding the generation process with 3D-aware representations, our method enhances geometric consistency and improves the disentanglement of facial identity from appearance attributes. We further design a diffusion architecture that conditions the denoising process on both identity embeddings and facial landmarks, enabling high-fidelity and identity-preserving face swaps. Extensive experiments on CelebA, FFHQ, and CelebV-Text demonstrate that DiffSwap++ outperforms prior methods in preserving source identity while maintaining target pose and expression. Additionally, we introduce a biometric-style evaluation and conduct a user study to further validate the realism and effectiveness of our approach.

### [18] [Beyond Softmax: Dual-Branch Sigmoid Architecture for Accurate Class Activation Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05590)
*Yoojin Oh,Junhyug Noh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-branch sigmoid head method that decouples localization from classification to fix distortions in CAM methods caused by softmax classifiers, improving explanation fidelity without sacrificing classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class Activation Mapping (CAM) methods suffer from fundamental distortions due to reliance on softmax classifiers: additive logit shifts that bias importance scores and sign collapse that conflates excitatory and inhibitory features.

Method: Clone the classification head into a parallel branch with per-class sigmoid outputs, freeze the original softmax head, and fine-tune only the sigmoid branch with class-balanced binary supervision. At inference, softmax handles classification while sigmoid generates class evidence maps.

Result: Extensive evaluations on fine-grained tasks (CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars) and WSOL benchmarks (ImageNet-1K, OpenImages30K) show improved explanation fidelity and consistent Top-1 Localization gains without any drop in classification accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture-agnostic method effectively decouples localization from classification, preserving both magnitude and sign of feature contributions while maintaining recognition accuracy, and integrates seamlessly with most CAM variants.

Abstract: Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and its extensions have become indispensable tools for visualizing the evidence behind deep network predictions. However, by relying on a final softmax classifier, these methods suffer from two fundamental distortions: additive logit shifts that arbitrarily bias importance scores, and sign collapse that conflates excitatory and inhibitory features. We propose a simple, architecture-agnostic dual-branch sigmoid head that decouples localization from classification. Given any pretrained model, we clone its classification head into a parallel branch ending in per-class sigmoid outputs, freeze the original softmax head, and fine-tune only the sigmoid branch with class-balanced binary supervision. At inference, softmax retains recognition accuracy, while class evidence maps are generated from the sigmoid branch -- preserving both magnitude and sign of feature contributions. Our method integrates seamlessly with most CAM variants and incurs negligible overhead. Extensive evaluations on fine-grained tasks (CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars) and WSOL benchmarks (ImageNet-1K, OpenImages30K) show improved explanation fidelity and consistent Top-1 Localization gains -- without any drop in classification accuracy.

Abstract: This paper proposes a MedGemma-based framework for automatic abnormality detection in musculoskeletal radiographs. Departing from conventional autoencoder and neural network pipelines, the proposed method leverages the MedGemma foundation model, incorporating a SigLIP-derived vision encoder pretrained on diverse medical imaging modalities. Preprocessed X-ray images are encoded into high-dimensional embeddings using the MedGemma vision backbone, which are subsequently passed through a lightweight multilayer perceptron for binary classification. Experimental assessment reveals that the MedGemma-driven classifier exhibits strong performance, exceeding conventional convolutional and autoencoder-based metrics. Additionally, the model leverages MedGemma's transfer learning capabilities, enhancing generalization and optimizing feature engineering. The integration of a modern medical foundation model not only enhances representation learning but also facilitates modular training strategies such as selective encoder block unfreezing for efficient domain adaptation.

TL;DR: Real-time monitoring system for high deposition rate robotic additive manufacturing detects shape deviations during manufacturing by comparing growing part with reference model, enabling timely intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maintaining shape accuracy is critical challenge in high deposition rate AM processes due to process instabilities in open-loop systems. Detecting deviations early prevents error propagation and ensures part quality.

Method: Real-time monitoring system that acquires and reconstructs the growing part, then directly compares it with a near-net reference model to detect shape deviations during manufacturing.

Result: Early identification of shape inconsistencies followed by segmenting and tracking each deviation region enables timely intervention and compensation.

Conclusion: The monitoring system paves the way for achieving consistent part quality in high deposition rate robotic additive manufacturing processes.

Abstract: Additive manufacturing (AM) is an emerging digital manufacturing technology to produce complex and freeform objects through a layer-wise deposition. High deposition rate robotic AM (HDRRAM) processes, such as cold spray additive manufacturing (CSAM), offer significantly increased build speeds by delivering large volumes of material per unit time. However, maintaining shape accuracy remains a critical challenge, particularly due to process instabilities in current open-loop systems. Detecting these deviations as they occur is essential to prevent error propagation, ensure part quality, and minimize post-processing requirements. This study presents a real-time monitoring system to acquire and reconstruct the growing part and directly compares it with a near-net reference model to detect the shape deviation during the manufacturing process. The early identification of shape inconsistencies, followed by segmenting and tracking each deviation region, paves the way for timely intervention and compensation to achieve consistent part quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TraCe addresses artifacts in text-to-3D generation by formulating the process as learning optimal transport trajectories between rendering distributions and target distributions, enabling high-quality generation with smaller CFG values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current optimization-based text-to-3D generation methods using Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) introduce artifacts like over-saturation and over-smoothing in generated 3D assets.

Method: Theoretical establishment of SDS as a simplified Schrödinger Bridge instance, then introducing TraCe framework that explicitly constructs diffusion bridges from current renderings to text-conditioned targets and trains LoRA-adapted models on trajectory score dynamics.

Result: TraCe consistently achieves superior quality and fidelity compared to state-of-the-art techniques in comprehensive experiments.

Conclusion: The Schrödinger Bridge framework provides a mathematically trackable approach for text-to-3D generation that overcomes limitations of SDS-based methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in optimization-based text-to-3D generation heavily rely on distilling knowledge from pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models using techniques like Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), which often introduce artifacts such as over-saturation and over-smoothing into the generated 3D assets. In this paper, we address this essential problem by formulating the generation process as learning an optimal, direct transport trajectory between the distribution of the current rendering and the desired target distribution, thereby enabling high-quality generation with smaller Classifier-free Guidance (CFG) values. At first, we theoretically establish SDS as a simplified instance of the Schrödinger Bridge framework. We prove that SDS employs the reverse process of an Schrödinger Bridge, which, under specific conditions (e.g., a Gaussian noise as one end), collapses to SDS's score function of the pre-trained diffusion model. Based upon this, we introduce Trajectory-Centric Distillation (TraCe), a novel text-to-3D generation framework, which reformulates the mathematically trackable framework of Schrödinger Bridge to explicitly construct a diffusion bridge from the current rendering to its text-conditioned, denoised target, and trains a LoRA-adapted model on this trajectory's score dynamics for robust 3D optimization. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TraCe consistently achieves superior quality and fidelity to state-of-the-art techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-level motion parsing framework for action quality assessment that uses enhanced spatial-temporal pose features with Action-Unit Parser, Motion Parser, Condition Parser, and Weight-Adjust Scoring Module to achieve state-of-the-art performance in diving sports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human pose variations are crucial for action quality assessment, where subtle spatial-temporal differences determine scoring in high-level competitions. Current methods need better handling of nuanced pose variations and external conditions like water splash in diving.

Method: Multi-level framework with: 1) Action-Unit Parser for precise action segmentation and local-global pose representations, 2) Motion Parser for spatial-temporal feature learning of pose changes and appearance details, 3) Condition Parser for external factors like water splash, and 4) Weight-Adjust Scoring Module to accommodate diverse action types and multi-scale action-units.

Result: Extensive evaluations on large-scale diving sports datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both action segmentation and action scoring tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-level motion parsing framework effectively captures subtle pose variations and external conditions, achieving superior performance in action quality assessment for diving sports.

Abstract: Human pose serves as a cornerstone of action quality assessment (AQA), where subtle spatial-temporal variations in pose often distinguish excellence from mediocrity. In high-level competitions, these nuanced differences become decisive factors in scoring. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-level motion parsing framework for AQA based on enhanced spatial-temporal pose features. On the first level, the Action-Unit Parser is designed with the help of pose extraction to achieve precise action segmentation and comprehensive local-global pose representations. On the second level, Motion Parser is used by spatial-temporal feature learning to capture pose changes and appearance details for each action-unit. Meanwhile, some special conditions other than body-related will impact action scoring, like water splash in diving. In this work, we design an additional Condition Parser to offer users more flexibility in their choices. Finally, Weight-Adjust Scoring Module is introduced to better accommodate the diverse requirements of various action types and the multi-scale nature of action-units. Extensive evaluations on large-scale diving sports datasets demonstrate that our multi-level motion parsing framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in both action segmentation and action scoring tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2I diffusion models are generic and fail to adapt to individual users' nuanced aesthetic preferences, creating a need for personalized editing capabilities.

Method: Collaborative Direct Preference Optimization (C-DPO) encodes users as nodes in a dynamic preference graph, learns embeddings via lightweight GNN, and integrates these into a novel DPO objective that jointly optimizes for individual alignment and neighborhood coherence.

Result: Comprehensive experiments including user studies and quantitative benchmarks show the method consistently outperforms baselines in generating edits aligned with user preferences.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables personalized image editing in diffusion models by leveraging collaborative signals and user-specific preference modeling.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have made remarkable strides in generating and editing high-fidelity images from text. Yet, these models remain fundamentally generic, failing to adapt to the nuanced aesthetic preferences of individual users. In this work, we present the first framework for personalized image editing in diffusion models, introducing Collaborative Direct Preference Optimization (C-DPO), a novel method that aligns image edits with user-specific preferences while leveraging collaborative signals from like-minded individuals. Our approach encodes each user as a node in a dynamic preference graph and learns embeddings via a lightweight graph neural network, enabling information sharing across users with overlapping visual tastes. We enhance a diffusion model's editing capabilities by integrating these personalized embeddings into a novel DPO objective, which jointly optimizes for individual alignment and neighborhood coherence. Comprehensive experiments, including user studies and quantitative benchmarks, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines in generating edits that are aligned with user preferences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CapsNet performs well on simple datasets but fails on complex ones, is slower than CNNs, and uses too many parameters. The authors aim to overcome these limitations.

Method: Introduces a Convolutional Fully-Connected Capsule Network (CFC-CapsNet) with a new CFC layer that creates capsules using a different method, producing fewer but more powerful capsules.

Result: CFC-CapsNet achieves competitive accuracy with faster training and inference, using fewer parameters on CIFAR-10, SVHN, and Fashion-MNIST datasets compared to conventional CapsNet.

Conclusion: The proposed CFC-CapsNet successfully addresses CapsNet's shortcomings by creating capsules more efficiently, making it more practical for complex datasets and real applications.

Abstract: A Capsule Network (CapsNet) is a relatively new classifier and one of the possible successors of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CapsNet maintains the spatial hierarchies between the features and outperforms CNNs at classifying images including overlapping categories. Even though CapsNet works well on small-scale datasets such as MNIST, it fails to achieve a similar level of performance on more complicated datasets and real applications. In addition, CapsNet is slow compared to CNNs when performing the same task and relies on a higher number of parameters. In this work, we introduce Convolutional Fully-Connected Capsule Network (CFC-CapsNet) to address the shortcomings of CapsNet by creating capsules using a different method. We introduce a new layer (CFC layer) as an alternative solution to creating capsules. CFC-CapsNet produces fewer, yet more powerful capsules resulting in higher network accuracy. Our experiments show that CFC-CapsNet achieves competitive accuracy, faster training and inference and uses less number of parameters on the CIFAR-10, SVHN and Fashion-MNIST datasets compared to conventional CapsNet.

Motivation: Current RGB-based action recognition models learn superficial correlations and struggle with physical interaction dynamics and human poses in complex scenes, requiring a more nuanced comprehension grounded in physical space.

Method: Fuses V-JEPA 2's contextual, predictive world dynamics with CoMotion's explicit, occlusion-tolerant human pose data in a model architecture that grounds action recognition in physical space.

Result: Outperforms three other baselines on both InHARD (general action recognition) and UCF-19-Y-OCC (high-occlusion action recognition) benchmarks, with particularly strong performance in complex, occlusive scenes.

Conclusion: Action recognition should be supported by spatial understanding rather than statistical pattern recognition, emphasizing the importance of grounding in physical space.

Abstract: For embodied agents to effectively understand and interact within the world around them, they require a nuanced comprehension of human actions grounded in physical space. Current action recognition models, often relying on RGB video, learn superficial correlations between patterns and action labels, so they struggle to capture underlying physical interaction dynamics and human poses in complex scenes. We propose a model architecture that grounds action recognition in physical space by fusing two powerful, complementary representations: V-JEPA 2's contextual, predictive world dynamics and CoMotion's explicit, occlusion-tolerant human pose data. Our model is validated on both the InHARD and UCF-19-Y-OCC benchmarks for general action recognition and high-occlusion action recognition, respectively. Our model outperforms three other baselines, especially within complex, occlusive scenes. Our findings emphasize a need for action recognition to be supported by spatial understanding instead of statistical pattern recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional preprocessing steps for point cloud data monitoring (registration and mesh reconstruction) are error-prone, time-consuming, and can introduce artifacts that affect monitoring outcomes.

Method: Two alternative feature learning methods using intrinsic geometric properties (Laplacian and geodesic distances) combined with a monitoring scheme that uses thresholding to select features most indicative of out-of-control conditions.

Result: Numerical experiments and case studies demonstrate the approach's effectiveness in identifying different types of defects in complex shapes.

Conclusion: The proposed registration-free method provides an effective alternative to traditional preprocessing-heavy approaches for point cloud data monitoring in manufacturing processes.

Abstract: Modern sensing technologies have enabled the collection of unstructured point cloud data (PCD) of varying sizes, which are used to monitor the geometric accuracy of 3D objects. PCD are widely applied in advanced manufacturing processes, including additive, subtractive, and hybrid manufacturing. To ensure the consistency of analysis and avoid false alarms, preprocessing steps such as registration and mesh reconstruction are commonly applied prior to monitoring. However, these steps are error-prone, time-consuming and may introduce artifacts, potentially affecting monitoring outcomes. In this paper, we present a novel registration-free approach for monitoring PCD of complex shapes, eliminating the need for both registration and mesh reconstruction. Our proposal consists of two alternative feature learning methods and a common monitoring scheme. Feature learning methods leverage intrinsic geometric properties of the shape, captured via the Laplacian and geodesic distances. In the monitoring scheme, thresholding techniques are used to further select intrinsic features most indicative of potential out-of-control conditions. Numerical experiments and case studies highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach in identifying different types of defects.

Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models inherit cultural biases and fail to depict underrepresented regions faithfully, with existing benchmarks focusing mainly on object-centric categories rather than social activities that reflect cultural norms.

Method: Created CULTIVate benchmark with 576 prompts across 16 countries, using explainable descriptor-based evaluation framework across cultural dimensions (background, attire, objects, interactions) and proposed four metrics for cultural alignment, hallucination, exaggerated elements, and diversity.

Result: Found systematic disparities: models perform better for global north countries than global south, with distinct failure modes across T2I systems. Human studies confirmed metrics correlate more strongly with human judgments than existing text-image metrics.

Conclusion: CULTIVate provides an effective framework for measuring cultural faithfulness in T2I models, revealing significant cultural biases and offering improved evaluation metrics that better align with human judgments.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models achieve impressive photorealism by training on large-scale web data, but models inherit cultural biases and fail to depict underrepresented regions faithfully. Existing cultural benchmarks focus mainly on object-centric categories (e.g., food, attire, and architecture), overlooking the social and daily activities that more clearly reflect cultural norms. Few metrics exist for measuring cultural faithfulness. We introduce CULTIVate, a benchmark for evaluating T2I models on cross-cultural activities (e.g., greetings, dining, games, traditional dances, and cultural celebrations). CULTIVate spans 16 countries with 576 prompts and more than 19,000 images, and provides an explainable descriptor-based evaluation framework across multiple cultural dimensions, including background, attire, objects, and interactions. We propose four metrics to measure cultural alignment, hallucination, exaggerated elements, and diversity. Our findings reveal systematic disparities: models perform better for global north countries than for the global south, with distinct failure modes across T2I systems. Human studies confirm that our metrics correlate more strongly with human judgments than existing text-image metrics.

TL;DR: VMDT is the first unified benchmark for evaluating text-to-video (T2V) and video-to-text (V2T) models across five trustworthiness dimensions: safety, hallucination, fairness, privacy, and adversarial robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As foundation models become more sophisticated, ensuring trustworthiness is critical, but video modality lacks comprehensive trustworthiness benchmarks compared to text and image modalities.

Method: The authors introduce VMDT platform and conduct extensive evaluation of 7 T2V models and 19 V2T models across five trustworthiness dimensions using systematic testing framework.

Result: Key findings: all open-source T2V models fail to recognize harmful queries and generate harmful videos; T2V models show higher unfairness than image models; V2T models show unfairness and privacy risks increase with scale while hallucination and adversarial robustness improve; safety shows no correlation with model size.

Conclusion: There is urgent need for more robust and trustworthy video foundation models, and VMDT provides systematic framework for measuring and tracking progress toward this goal.

Abstract: As foundation models become more sophisticated, ensuring their trustworthiness becomes increasingly critical; yet, unlike text and image, the video modality still lacks comprehensive trustworthiness benchmarks. We introduce VMDT (Video-Modal DecodingTrust), the first unified platform for evaluating text-to-video (T2V) and video-to-text (V2T) models across five key trustworthiness dimensions: safety, hallucination, fairness, privacy, and adversarial robustness. Through our extensive evaluation of 7 T2V models and 19 V2T models using VMDT, we uncover several significant insights. For instance, all open-source T2V models evaluated fail to recognize harmful queries and often generate harmful videos, while exhibiting higher levels of unfairness compared to image modality models. In V2T models, unfairness and privacy risks rise with scale, whereas hallucination and adversarial robustness improve -- though overall performance remains low. Uniquely, safety shows no correlation with model size, implying that factors other than scale govern current safety levels. Our findings highlight the urgent need for developing more robust and trustworthy video foundation models, and VMDT provides a systematic framework for measuring and tracking progress toward this goal.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate matching of pedicle screws in both AP and lateral images is critical for spinal surgery success, but establishing screw correspondence, especially in lateral views, remains a significant clinical challenge.

Method: Compares screw combinations from dual C-arm images and employs 2D-3D alignment with screw CAD 3D models to accurately pair and estimate screw pose from dual views.

Result: Correct screw combination consistently outperforms incorrect pairings across all test cases, even before registration. After registration, correct combination further enhances alignment between projections and images, significantly reducing projection error.

Abstract: Accurate matching of pedicle screws in both anteroposterior (AP) and lateral (LAT) images is critical for successful spinal decompression and stabilization during surgery. However, establishing screw correspondence, especially in LAT views, remains a significant clinical challenge. This paper introduces a method to address pedicle screw correspondence and pose estimation from dual C-arm images. By comparing screw combinations, the approach demonstrates consistent accuracy in both pairing and registration tasks. The method also employs 2D-3D alignment with screw CAD 3D models to accurately pair and estimate screw pose from dual views. Our results show that the correct screw combination consistently outperforms incorrect pairings across all test cases, even prior to registration. After registration, the correct combination further enhances alignment between projections and images, significantly reducing projection error. This approach shows promise for improving surgical outcomes in spinal procedures by providing reliable feedback on screw positioning.

TL;DR: A new framework for generating large-scale vision-centric reasoning data with over 1M synthetic questions, showing strong performance across multimodal benchmarks and unexpected cross-modality transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of systematic approaches for building large-scale vision-centric reasoning datasets beyond visual math, given that current progress relies on undisclosed datasets and proprietary recipes.

Method: Two-stage synthesis framework: (1) scale generation of diverse reasoning questions, (2) complexity enhancement. Uses VLMs and reasoning LLMs to produce CoT traces capturing diverse cognitive behaviors. Includes preference data and instruction prompts for offline/online RL.

Result: Qwen2.5-VL-7B finetuned on this data outperforms all open-data baselines across vision benchmarks, surpasses closed-data models like MiMo-VL-7B-RL, and shows positive transfer to text-only reasoning (MMLU-Pro) and audio reasoning (MMAU). Also improves embodied QA despite no video/embodied data.

Conclusion: High-quality SFT with non-linear reasoning traces is essential for effective online RL; staged offline RL matches online performance with less compute; careful SFT enables substantial cross-modality transfer despite vision-centric focus.

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal reasoning has been driven largely by undisclosed datasets and proprietary data synthesis recipes, leaving open questions about how to systematically build large-scale, vision-centric reasoning datasets, particularly for tasks that go beyond visual math. In this work, we introduce a new reasoning data generation framework spanning diverse skills and levels of complexity with over 1M high-quality synthetic vision-centric questions. The dataset also includes preference data and instruction prompts supporting both offline and online RL. Our synthesis framework proceeds in two stages: (1) scale; and (2) complexity. Reasoning traces are then synthesized through a two-stage process that leverages VLMs and reasoning LLMs, producing CoT traces for VLMs that capture the richness and diverse cognitive behaviors found in frontier reasoning models. Remarkably, we show that finetuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on our data outperforms all open-data baselines across all evaluated vision-centric benchmarks, and even surpasses strong closed-data models such as MiMo-VL-7B-RL on V* Bench, CV-Bench and MMStar-V. Perhaps most surprising, despite being entirely vision-centric, our data transfers positively to text-only reasoning (MMLU-Pro) and audio reasoning (MMAU), demonstrating its effectiveness. Similarly, despite not containing videos or embodied visual data, we observe notable gains when evaluating on a single-evidence embodied QA benchmark (NiEH). Finally, we use our data to analyze the entire VLM post-training pipeline. Our empirical analysis highlights that (i) SFT on high-quality data with non-linear reasoning traces is essential for effective online RL, (ii) staged offline RL matches online RL's performance while reducing compute demands, and (iii) careful SFT on high quality data can substantially improve out-of-domain, cross-modality transfer.

*Xing Yao,Ahana Gangopadhyay,Hsi-Ming Chang,Ravi Soni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a data-centric investigation of adapting Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for ultrasound video segmentation, analyzing how training data characteristics and training regimes affect performance more than model architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2 performs poorly on medical imaging domains like ultrasound due to domain gap, and current adaptation studies focus too much on architectural changes while ignoring data characteristics and training strategies.

Method: Comprehensive analysis of SAM2 adaptation across three paradigms (task-specific fine-tuning, intermediate adaptation, multi-task joint training), five SAM2 variants, multiple prompting modes, and six ultrasound-specific augmentations on three ultrasound datasets.

Result: Data scale and temporal context are more important than model architecture or initialization, and joint training provides an efficient balance between modality alignment and task specialization.

Conclusion: The study provides empirical insights for developing efficient, data-aware adaptation pipelines for SAM2 in ultrasound video analysis, emphasizing data characteristics over architectural modifications.

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) video segmentation remains a challenging problem due to strong inter- and intra-dataset variability, motion artifacts, and limited annotated data. Although foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) demonstrate strong zero-shot and prompt-guided segmentation capabilities, their performance deteriorates substantially when transferred to medical imaging domains. Current adaptation studies mainly emphasize architectural modifications, while the influence of data characteristics and training regimes has not been systematically examined. In this study, we present a comprehensive, data-centric investigation of SAM2 adaptation for ultrasound video segmentation. We analyze how training-set size, video duration, and augmentation schemes affect adaptation performance under three paradigms: task-specific fine-tuning, intermediate adaptation, and multi-task joint training, across five SAM2 variants and multiple prompting modes. We further design six ultrasound-specific augmentations, assessing their effect relative to generic strategies. Experiments on three representative ultrasound datasets reveal that data scale and temporal context play a more decisive role than model architecture or initialization. Moreover, joint training offers an efficient compromise between modality alignment and task specialization. This work aims to provide empirical insights for developing efficient, data-aware adaptation pipelines for SAM2 in ultrasound video analysis.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a second-order geometric attention (SOGA) mechanism for detecting clinically significant prostate cancer lesions from biparametric MRI, achieving state-of-the-art performance on public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for prostate cancer detection rely on extensively annotated datasets and struggle with high lesion variability across prostate zones, while MRI analysis remains subjective and dependent on expert interpretation.

Method: Proposed a second-order geometric attention (SOGA) mechanism modeled on Riemannian manifold that learns from symmetric positive definite representations, integrated into U-Net and nnU-Net backbones through skip connections.

Result: Achieved Average Precision (AP) of 0.37 and AUC-ROC of 0.83 on PI-CAI dataset, outperforming baselines. On independent Prostate158 dataset, achieved AP of 0.37 and AUC-ROC of 0.75, demonstrating robust generalization.

Conclusion: The SOGA mechanism provides discriminative learned representations for csPCa lesion detection, showing improved performance and generalization compared to existing methods, suggesting potential for more reliable prostate cancer diagnosis.

Abstract: The detection of clinically significant prostate cancer lesions (csPCa) from biparametric magnetic resonance imaging (bp-MRI) has emerged as a noninvasive imaging technique for improving accurate diagnosis. Nevertheless, the analysis of such images remains highly dependent on the subjective expert interpretation. Deep learning approaches have been proposed for csPCa lesions detection and segmentation, but they remain limited due to their reliance on extensively annotated datasets. Moreover, the high lesion variability across prostate zones poses additional challenges, even for expert radiologists. This work introduces a second-order geometric attention (SOGA) mechanism that guides a dedicated segmentation network, through skip connections, to detect csPCa lesions. The proposed attention is modeled on the Riemannian manifold, learning from symmetric positive definitive (SPD) representations. The proposed mechanism was integrated into standard U-Net and nnU-Net backbones, and was validated on the publicly available PI-CAI dataset, achieving an Average Precision (AP) of 0.37 and an Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.83, outperforming baseline networks and attention-based methods. Furthermore, the approach was evaluated on the Prostate158 dataset as an independent test cohort, achieving an AP of 0.37 and an AUC-ROC of 0.75, confirming robust generalization and suggesting discriminative learned representations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TCSA-UDA is a text-driven cross-semantic alignment framework for unsupervised domain adaptation in medical image segmentation that uses domain-invariant textual class descriptions to guide visual representation learning and reduce domain shifts across imaging modalities like CT and MRI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised domain adaptation for medical image segmentation faces challenges due to substantial domain shifts across imaging modalities. While vision-language representation learning shows promise, its potential in UDA segmentation remains underexplored.

Method: Proposes TCSA-UDA with two key components: 1) vision-language covariance cosine loss to align image encoder features with inter-class textual semantic relations, and 2) prototype alignment module that aligns class-wise pixel-level feature distributions across domains using high-level semantic prototypes.

Result: Extensive experiments on cardiac, abdominal, and brain tumor segmentation benchmarks show TCSA-UDA significantly reduces domain shift and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art UDA methods.

Conclusion: TCSA-UDA establishes a new paradigm for integrating language-driven semantics into domain-adaptive medical image analysis, effectively addressing cross-modality domain adaptation challenges.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation for medical image segmentation remains a significant challenge due to substantial domain shifts across imaging modalities, such as CT and MRI. While recent vision-language representation learning methods have shown promise, their potential in UDA segmentation tasks remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose TCSA-UDA, a Text-driven Cross-Semantic Alignment framework that leverages domain-invariant textual class descriptions to guide visual representation learning. Our approach introduces a vision-language covariance cosine loss to directly align image encoder features with inter-class textual semantic relations, encouraging semantically meaningful and modality-invariant feature representations. Additionally, we incorporate a prototype alignment module that aligns class-wise pixel-level feature distributions across domains using high-level semantic prototypes. This mitigates residual category-level discrepancies and enhances cross-modal consistency. Extensive experiments on challenging cross-modality cardiac, abdominal, and brain tumor segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our TCSA-UDA framework significantly reduces domain shift and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art UDA methods, establishing a new paradigm for integrating language-driven semantics into domain-adaptive medical image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes integrating positional priors into deep learning-based super-resolution methods for Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) system matrix calibration to address time-consuming calibration processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MPI system matrix calibration is time-consuming and requires repeated measurements when system parameters change. Existing deep learning super-resolution methods don't fully exploit physical prior knowledge like symmetric positional priors.

Method: Integrated positional priors into existing frameworks for system matrix calibration, with theoretical justification and empirical validation using both 2D and 3D system matrix super-resolution methods.

Result: The efficacy of incorporating positional priors was empirically validated through experiments.

Conclusion: Positional priors can be effectively integrated into MPI system matrix calibration frameworks to improve the process.

Abstract: Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is a novel medical imaging modality. One of the established methods for MPI reconstruction is based on the System Matrix (SM). However, the calibration of the SM is often time-consuming and requires repeated measurements whenever the system parameters change. Current methodologies utilize deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) techniques to expedite SM calibration; nevertheless, these strategies do not fully exploit physical prior knowledge associated with the SM, such as symmetric positional priors. Consequently, we integrated positional priors into existing frameworks for SM calibration. Underpinned by theoretical justification, we empirically validated the efficacy of incorporating positional priors through experiments involving both 2D and 3D SM SR methods.

TL;DR: Proposes MACMD-based decoder for medical image segmentation that enhances attention mechanisms and channel mixing between encoder-decoder stages to address limitations in capturing both local details and global context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of CNNs (struggle with long-range dependencies) and Transformers (lack local contextual preservation) in medical image segmentation, particularly information loss in shallow layers and inefficient integration between encoder-decoder stages.

Method: MACMD-based decoder with hierarchical dilated convolutions, attention-driven modulation, and cross channel-mixing module via skip connections to capture long-range dependencies while preserving local contextual details.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both binary and multi-organ segmentation tasks in terms of Dice score and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively achieves accurate and robust segmentation performance by better integrating local details with global context through enhanced attention mechanisms and channel mixing.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation faces challenges due to variations in anatomical structures. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) effectively capture local features, they struggle with modeling long-range dependencies. Transformers mitigate this issue with self-attention mechanisms but lack the ability to preserve local contextual information. State-of-the-art models primarily follow an encoder-decoder architecture, achieving notable success. However, two key limitations remain: (1) Shallow layers, which are closer to the input, capture fine-grained details but suffer from information loss as data propagates through deeper layers. (2) Inefficient integration of local details and global context between the encoder and decoder stages. To address these challenges, we propose the MACMD-based decoder, which enhances attention mechanisms and facilitates channel mixing between encoder and decoder stages via skip connections. This design leverages hierarchical dilated convolutions, attention-driven modulation, and a cross channel-mixing module to capture long-range dependencies while preserving local contextual details, essential for precise medical image segmentation. We evaluated our approach using multiple transformer encoders on both binary and multi-organ segmentation tasks. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of Dice score and computational efficiency, highlighting its effectiveness in achieving accurate and robust segmentation performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LRANet++ is an end-to-end text spotting framework that uses a novel parameterized text shape method based on low-rank approximation for precise detection and a triple assignment detection head for fast inference, achieving state-of-the-art performance on arbitrary-shaped text spotting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current end-to-end text spotters lack reliable and efficient text detection methods for arbitrary-shaped text, creating a bottleneck in performance.

Method: Proposes a data-driven low-rank approximation method for text shape representation using ℓ₁-norm formulation to handle annotation noise, and a triple assignment detection head with deep sparse, ultra-lightweight sparse, and dense branches for stabilized training and accelerated inference.

Result: Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in accurately and efficiently spotting arbitrary-shaped text.

Conclusion: LRANet++ effectively addresses the text detection bottleneck in end-to-end text spotting through innovative shape representation and detection architecture, achieving both accuracy and efficiency for arbitrary-shaped text.

Abstract: End-to-end text spotting aims to jointly optimize text detection and recognition within a unified framework. Despite significant progress, designing an accurate and efficient end-to-end text spotter for arbitrary-shaped text remains largely unsolved. We identify the primary bottleneck as the lack of a reliable and efficient text detection method. To address this, we propose a novel parameterized text shape method based on low-rank approximation for precise detection and a triple assignment detection head to enable fast inference. Specifically, unlike other shape representation methods that employ data-irrelevant parameterization, our data-driven approach derives a low-rank subspace directly from labeled text boundaries. To ensure this process is robust against the inherent annotation noise in this data, we utilize a specialized recovery method based on an $\ell_1$-norm formulation, which accurately reconstructs the text shape with only a few key orthogonal vectors. By exploiting the inherent shape correlation among different text contours, our method achieves consistency and compactness in shape representation. Next, the triple assignment scheme introduces a novel architecture where a deep sparse branch (for stabilized training) is used to guide the learning of an ultra-lightweight sparse branch (for accelerated inference), while a dense branch provides rich parallel supervision. Building upon these advancements, we integrate the enhanced detection module with a lightweight recognition branch to form an end-to-end text spotting framework, termed LRANet++, capable of accurately and efficiently spotting arbitrary-shaped text. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of LRANet++ compared to state-of-the-art methods.

*Yunge Li,Lanyu Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes using Hilbert curve reordering to improve the efficiency of 2D local attention in vision transformers by increasing block sparsity, achieving 4-18× speedups with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global self-attention has quadratic compute and memory costs that limit its use in high-resolution images, while conventional local attention patterns often fail to deliver significant speedups due to non-contiguous tokens in 1D sequences.

Method: Image tokens are reordered along a Hilbert curve, then windows and neighborhoods are formed on the reordered 1D sequence. This strategy significantly increases block sparsity and can be combined with existing block-sparse kernels.

Result: Hilbert Window Attention and Hilbert Slide Attention accelerate window attention and slide attention by about 4× and 18× respectively. Hilbert Window Transformer and Hilbert Neighborhood Transformer achieve end-to-end speedups with minimal accuracy loss.

Conclusion: Combining Hilbert-guided local attention with block-sparse kernels offers a general and practical approach to enhancing the efficiency of 2D local attention for images.

Abstract: The quadratic compute and memory costs of global self-attention severely limit its use in high-resolution images. Local attention reduces complexity by restricting attention to neighborhoods. Block-sparse kernels can further improve the efficiency of local attention, but conventional local attention patterns often fail to deliver significant speedups because tokens within a window are not contiguous in the 1D sequence. This work proposes a novel method for constructing windows and neighborhoods based on the Hilbert curve. Image tokens are first reordered along a Hilbert curve, and windows and neighborhoods are then formed on the reordered 1D sequence. From a block-sparse perspective, this strategy significantly increases block sparsity and can be combined with existing block-sparse kernels to improve the efficiency of 2D local attention. Experiments show that the proposed Hilbert Window Attention and Hilbert Slide Attention can accelerate window attention and slide attention by about $4\times$ and $18\times$, respectively. To assess practicality, the strategy is instantiated as the Hilbert Window Transformer and the Hilbert Neighborhood Transformer, both of which achieve end-to-end speedups with minimal accuracy loss. Overall, combining Hilbert-guided local attention with block-sparse kernels offers a general and practical approach to enhancing the efficiency of 2D local attention for images.

Conclusion: The proposed TYrPPG algorithm shows promising prospects and superiority in remote heart rate estimation, proving the feasibility of using Mambaout-based modules for efficient rPPG analysis.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) can remotely extract physiological signals from RGB video, which has many advantages in detecting heart rate, such as low cost and no invasion to patients. The existing rPPG model is usually based on the transformer module, which has low computation efficiency. Recently, the Mamba model has garnered increasing attention due to its efficient performance in natural language processing tasks, demonstrating potential as a substitute for transformer-based algorithms. However, the Mambaout model and its variants prove that the SSM module, which is the core component of the Mamba model, is unnecessary for the vision task. Therefore, we hope to prove the feasibility of using the Mambaout-based module to remotely learn the heart rate. Specifically, we propose a novel rPPG algorithm called uncomplicated and enhanced learning capability rPPG (TYrPPG). This paper introduces an innovative gated video understanding block (GVB) designed for efficient analysis of RGB videos. Based on the Mambaout structure, this block integrates 2D-CNN and 3D-CNN to enhance video understanding for analysis. In addition, we propose a comprehensive supervised loss function (CSL) to improve the model's learning capability, along with its weakly supervised variants. The experiments show that our TYrPPG can achieve state-of-the-art performance in commonly used datasets, indicating its prospects and superiority in remote heart rate estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of Alzheimer's disease is critical, and handwriting provides a non-invasive window into motor and cognitive decline. Existing handwriting-based AD studies haven't systematically examined how task type influences diagnostic performance and cross-task generalization, while vision-language models' potential for handwriting-based disease detection remains unexplored.

Method: A lightweight Cross-Layer Fusion Adapter framework that implants multi-level fusion adapters within CLIP's visual encoder to progressively align representations toward handwriting-specific medical cues, enabling prompt-free and efficient zero-shot inference.

Result: The framework enables systematic investigation of cross-task generalization, revealing which task types and writing patterns most effectively discriminate AD. Extensive analyses highlight characteristic stroke patterns and task-level factors that contribute to early AD identification.

Conclusion: The approach offers both diagnostic insights and a benchmark for handwriting-based cognitive assessment, closing the gap in applying vision-language models to handwriting-based disease detection for Alzheimer's screening.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder for which early detection is critical. Handwriting-often disrupted in prodromal AD-provides a non-invasive and cost-effective window into subtle motor and cognitive decline. Existing handwriting-based AD studies, mostly relying on online trajectories and hand-crafted features, have not systematically examined how task type influences diagnostic performance and cross-task generalization. Meanwhile, large-scale vision language models have demonstrated remarkable zero or few-shot anomaly detection in natural images and strong adaptability across medical modalities such as chest X-ray and brain MRI. However, handwriting-based disease detection remains largely unexplored within this paradigm. To close this gap, we introduce a lightweight Cross-Layer Fusion Adapter framework that repurposes CLIP for handwriting-based AD screening. CLFA implants multi-level fusion adapters within the visual encoder to progressively align representations toward handwriting-specific medical cues, enabling prompt-free and efficient zero-shot inference. Using this framework, we systematically investigate cross-task generalization-training on a specific handwriting task and evaluating on unseen ones-to reveal which task types and writing patterns most effectively discriminate AD. Extensive analyses further highlight characteristic stroke patterns and task-level factors that contribute to early AD identification, offering both diagnostic insights and a benchmark for handwriting-based cognitive assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classifier-guided diffusion models suffer from overconfident predictions during early denoising steps, causing guidance gradients to vanish and limiting their effectiveness in conditional image generation.

Method: Two complementary approaches: 1) Differentiable calibration objective using Smooth Expected Calibration Error for classifier fine-tuning, and 2) Enhanced sampling guidance methods including tilted sampling with batch-level reweighting, adaptive entropy-regularized sampling, and novel f-divergence-based sampling strategy.

Result: Achieved FID of 2.13 on ImageNet 128x128 using ResNet-101 classifier, improving upon existing classifier-guided diffusion methods while requiring no diffusion model retraining.

Conclusion: Principled calibration and divergence-aware sampling provide practical and effective improvements for classifier-guided diffusion, addressing the overconfidence issue and enhancing conditional image generation performance.

Abstract: Classifier-guided diffusion models have emerged as a powerful approach for conditional image generation, but they suffer from overconfident predictions during early denoising steps, causing the guidance gradient to vanish. This paper introduces two complementary contributions to address this issue. First, we propose a differentiable calibration objective based on the Smooth Expected Calibration Error (Smooth ECE), which improves classifier calibration with minimal fine-tuning and yields measurable improvements in Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Second, we develop enhanced sampling guidance methods that operate on off-the-shelf classifiers without requiring retraining. These include tilted sampling with batch-level reweighting, adaptive entropy-regularized sampling to preserve diversity, and a novel f-divergence-based sampling strategy that strengthens class-consistent guidance while maintaining mode coverage. Experiments on ImageNet 128x128 demonstrate that our divergence-regularized guidance achieves an FID of 2.13 using a ResNet-101 classifier, improving upon existing classifier-guided diffusion methods while requiring no diffusion model retraining. The results show that principled calibration and divergence-aware sampling provide practical and effective improvements for classifier-guided diffusion.

Abstract: The effective segmentation of 3D data is crucial for a wide range of industrial applications, especially for detecting subtle defects in the field of integrated circuits (IC). Ceramic package substrates (CPS), as an important electronic material, are essential in IC packaging owing to their superior physical and chemical properties. However, the complex structure and minor defects of CPS, along with the absence of a publically available dataset, significantly hinder the development of CPS surface defect detection. In this study, we construct a high-quality point cloud dataset for 3D segmentation of surface defects in CPS, i.e., CPS3D-Seg, which has the best point resolution and precision compared to existing 3D industrial datasets. CPS3D-Seg consists of 1300 point cloud samples under 20 product categories, and each sample provides accurate point-level annotations. Meanwhile, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark based on SOTA point cloud segmentation algorithms to validate the effectiveness of CPS3D-Seg. Additionally, we propose a novel 3D segmentation method based on causal inference (CINet), which quantifies potential confounders in point clouds through Structural Refine (SR) and Quality Assessment (QA) Modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CINet significantly outperforms existing algorithms in both mIoU and accuracy.

TL;DR: CGCE is a plug-and-play framework that uses lightweight classifiers to detect and refine unsafe text embeddings, enabling robust concept erasure in generative models without modifying original weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept erasure methods are vulnerable to adversarial attacks and degrade model quality, creating a trade-off between safety and performance that needs to be addressed.

Method: Classifier-guided approach using lightweight classifiers on text embeddings to detect unsafe concepts and refine prompts, modifying only unsafe embeddings at inference time without altering model weights.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art robustness against red-teaming attacks while maintaining high generative utility, successfully applied to various T2I and T2V models.

Conclusion: CGCE provides a practical and effective solution for safe generative AI, offering superior balance between safety and performance through scalable multi-concept erasure.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large-scale generative models have enabled the creation of high-quality images and videos, but have also raised significant safety concerns regarding the generation of unsafe content. To mitigate this, concept erasure methods have been developed to remove undesirable concepts from pre-trained models. However, existing methods remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can regenerate the erased content. Moreover, achieving robust erasure often degrades the model's generative quality for safe, unrelated concepts, creating a difficult trade-off between safety and performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Classifier-Guided Concept Erasure (CGCE), an efficient plug-and-play framework that provides robust concept erasure for diverse generative models without altering their original weights. CGCE uses a lightweight classifier operating on text embeddings to first detect and then refine prompts containing undesired concepts. This approach is highly scalable, allowing for multi-concept erasure by aggregating guidance from several classifiers. By modifying only unsafe embeddings at inference time, our method prevents harmful content generation while preserving the model's original quality on benign prompts. Extensive experiments show that CGCE achieves state-of-the-art robustness against a wide range of red-teaming attacks. Our approach also maintains high generative utility, demonstrating a superior balance between safety and performance. We showcase the versatility of CGCE through its successful application to various modern T2I and T2V models, establishing it as a practical and effective solution for safe generative AI.

### [44] [Light-Field Dataset for Disparity Based Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05866)
*Suresh Nehra,Aupendu Kar,Jayanta Mukhopadhyay,Prabir Kumar Biswas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new publicly available light field image dataset containing 285 real images from Lytro Illum camera and 13 synthetic images, addressing the need for suitable datasets for disparity-based depth estimation algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a critical need for suitable light field image datasets to develop and test novel disparity-based depth estimation algorithms, as the trade-off between angular and spatial information depends on camera focal position.

Method: Created a comprehensive dataset with 285 real light field images captured using Lytro Illum camera and 13 synthetic LF images, including synthetic datasets with similar disparity characteristics to real cameras and stereo light field datasets using mechanical gantry system and Blender.

Result: The proposed dataset is publicly available and addresses shortcomings of currently available light field datasets, demonstrating the effect of focal position on disparity of 3D points.

Conclusion: The introduced light field image dataset provides essential resources for developing and testing depth estimation algorithms, with both real and synthetic components that capture the critical characteristics of light field imaging.

Abstract: A Light Field (LF) camera consists of an additional two-dimensional array of micro-lenses placed between the main lens and sensor, compared to a conventional camera. The sensor pixels under each micro-lens receive light from a sub-aperture of the main lens. This enables the image sensor to capture both spatial information and the angular resolution of a scene point. This additional angular information is used to estimate the depth of a 3-D scene. The continuum of virtual viewpoints in light field data enables efficient depth estimation using Epipolar Line Images (EPIs) with robust occlusion handling. However, the trade-off between angular information and spatial information is very critical and depends on the focal position of the camera. To design, develop, implement, and test novel disparity-based light field depth estimation algorithms, the availability of suitable light field image datasets is essential. In this paper, a publicly available light field image dataset is introduced and thoroughly described. We have also demonstrated the effect of focal position on the disparity of a 3-D point as well as the shortcomings of the currently available light field dataset. The proposed dataset contains 285 light field images captured using a Lytro Illum LF camera and 13 synthetic LF images. The proposed dataset also comprises a synthetic dataset with similar disparity characteristics to those of a real light field camera. A real and synthetic stereo light field dataset is also created by using a mechanical gantry system and Blender. The dataset is available at https://github.com/aupendu/light-field-dataset.

*Jian Zhu,Xin Zou,Jun Sun,Cheng Luo,Lei Liu,Lingfang Zeng,Ning Zhang,Bian Wu,Chang Tang,Lirong Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoEGCL introduces fine-grained ego-graph fusion using Mixture-of-Experts for multi-view clustering, achieving state-of-the-art performance by addressing coarse-grained graph fusion limitations in existing GNN-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Graph Neural Network methods for Multi-View Clustering suffer from coarse-grained graph fusion, where separate graph structures are fused at the view level rather than at a more granular sample level.

Method: Proposes Mixture of Ego-Graphs Contrastive Representation Learning (MoEGCL) with two modules: Mixture of Ego-Graphs Fusion (MoEGF) that constructs ego graphs and uses Mixture-of-Experts for sample-level fusion, and Ego Graph Contrastive Learning (EGCL) that aligns fused representations with view-specific representations.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoEGCL achieves state-of-the-art results in deep multi-view clustering tasks, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: MoEGCL successfully addresses the coarse-grained graph fusion problem in multi-view clustering through fine-grained ego-graph fusion and contrastive learning, leading to superior clustering performance.

Abstract: In recent years, the advancement of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has significantly propelled progress in Multi-View Clustering (MVC). However, existing methods face the problem of coarse-grained graph fusion. Specifically, current approaches typically generate a separate graph structure for each view and then perform weighted fusion of graph structures at the view level, which is a relatively rough strategy. To address this limitation, we present a novel Mixture of Ego-Graphs Contrastive Representation Learning (MoEGCL). It mainly consists of two modules. In particular, we propose an innovative Mixture of Ego-Graphs Fusion (MoEGF), which constructs ego graphs and utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts network to implement fine-grained fusion of ego graphs at the sample level, rather than the conventional view-level fusion. Additionally, we present the Ego Graph Contrastive Learning (EGCL) module to align the fused representation with the view-specific representation. The EGCL module enhances the representation similarity of samples from the same cluster, not merely from the same sample, further boosting fine-grained graph representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoEGCL achieves state-of-the-art results in deep multi-view clustering tasks. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/HackerHyper/MoEGCL.

### [46] [Towards Frequency-Adaptive Learning for SAR Despeckling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05890)
*Ziqing Ma,Chang Yang,Zhichang Guo,Yao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAR-FAH is a frequency-adaptive heterogeneous despeckling model that uses wavelet decomposition to separate SAR images into frequency sub-bands, then applies specialized neural networks (neural ODEs for low-frequency and enhanced U-Net with deformable convolutions for high-frequency) to address different speckle statistics, achieving superior noise removal and structural preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR images are corrupted by speckle noise that limits precision applications. Existing deep learning methods use unified networks that fail to account for distinct speckle statistics across different spatial characteristics, leading to artifacts, blurred edges, and texture distortion.

Method: 1) Wavelet decomposition separates images into frequency sub-bands; 2) Neural ODEs handle low-frequency components for structural fidelity and smoothness; 3) Enhanced U-Net with deformable convolutions processes high-frequency sub-bands for edge/texture preservation and noise suppression.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real SAR images validate superior performance in both noise removal and structural preservation compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The frequency-adaptive heterogeneous approach effectively addresses varying speckle statistics across different frequency components, providing a robust solution for SAR despeckling that preserves important structural features while removing noise.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images are inherently corrupted by speckle noise, limiting their utility in high-precision applications. While deep learning methods have shown promise in SAR despeckling, most methods employ a single unified network to process the entire image, failing to account for the distinct speckle statistics associated with different spatial physical characteristics. It often leads to artifacts, blurred edges, and texture distortion. To address these issues, we propose SAR-FAH, a frequency-adaptive heterogeneous despeckling model based on a divide-and-conquer architecture. First, wavelet decomposition is used to separate the image into frequency sub-bands carrying different intrinsic characteristics. Inspired by their differing noise characteristics, we design specialized sub-networks for different frequency components. The tailored approach leverages statistical variations across frequencies, improving edge and texture preservation while suppressing noise. Specifically, for the low-frequency part, denoising is formulated as a continuous dynamic system via neural ordinary differential equations, ensuring structural fidelity and sufficient smoothness that prevents artifacts. For high-frequency sub-bands rich in edges and textures, we introduce an enhanced U-Net with deformable convolutions for noise suppression and enhanced features. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real SAR images validate the superior performance of the proposed model in noise removal and structural preservation.

Method: Designs Hybrid Second-Order Gradient Histogram (H2H) feature descriptor and integrates it with Sparse Regularized Nuclear Norm based Matrix Regression (SR_NMR), imposing global low-rank constraint on residual matrix.

Result: Experimental results show the method significantly outperforms existing regression-based classification approaches under challenging scenarios with occlusions, illumination changes, and unconstrained environments.

Conclusion: The proposed H2H-GLRSR model effectively handles complex face recognition challenges through its novel feature descriptor and global low-rank sparse regression framework.

Abstract: Low-rank sparse regression models have been widely applied in the field of face recognition. To further address the challenges caused by complex occlusions and illumination variations, this paper proposes a Hybrid Second-Order Gradient Histogram based Global Low-Rank Sparse Regression (H2H-GLRSR) model. Specifically, a novel feature descriptor called the Hybrid Second-Order Gradient Histogram (H2H) is first designed to more effectively characterize the local structural features of facial images. Then, this descriptor is integrated with the Sparse Regularized Nuclear Norm based Matrix Regression (SR$\_$NMR). Moreover, a global low-rank constraint is imposed on the residual matrix, enabling the model to better capture the global correlations inherent in structured noise. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing regression-based classification approaches under challenging scenarios involving occlusions, illumination changes, and unconstrained environments.

We evaluate our method on 3DSSG and Replica benchmarks across four tasks-scene question answering, visual grounding, instance retrieval, and task planning-demonstrating robust generalization and superior performance in diverse environments. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining open-vocabulary perception with retrieval-based reasoning for scalable 3D scene understanding.

Conclusion: The modular framework effectively enhances quantized model performance across architectures and QAT methods without requiring network modifications, demonstrating strong generalization and theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Despite the effectiveness of quantization-aware training (QAT) in compressing deep neural networks, its performance on multi-task architectures often degrades significantly due to task-specific feature discrepancies and gradient conflicts. To address these challenges, we propose Gradient-Aware Balanced Feature Fusion (GABFusion), which dynamically balances gradient magnitudes and fuses task-specific features in a quantization-friendly manner. We further introduce Attention Distribution Alignment (ADA), a feature-level distillation strategy tailored for quantized models. Our method demonstrates strong generalization across network architectures and QAT algorithms, with theoretical guarantees on gradient bias reduction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our strategy consistently enhances a variety of QAT methods across different network architectures and bit-widths. On PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets, the proposed approach achieves average mAP improvements of approximately 3.3% and 1.6%, respectively. When applied to YOLOv5 under 4-bit quantization, our method narrows the accuracy gap with the full-precision model to only 1.7% on VOC, showcasing its effectiveness in preserving performance under low-bit constraints. Notably, the proposed framework is modular, easy to integrate, and compatible with any existing QAT technique-enhancing the performance of quantized models without requiring modifications to the original network architecture.

### [50] [Causal Tracing of Object Representations in Large Vision Language Models: Mechanistic Interpretability and Hallucination Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05923)
*Qiming Li,Zekai Ye,Xiaocheng Feng,Weihong Zhong,Weitao Ma,Xiachong Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FCCT framework for fine-grained cross-modal causal tracing in LVLMs and proposes IRI, a training-free inference-time technique that improves visual perception and reduces hallucination by intervening on specific model components and layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mechanistic interpretability analyses for LVLMs are insufficiently comprehensive, lacking examination of visual/textual tokens, model components, and full layer ranges, which limits insights for improving model faithfulness and downstream tasks like hallucination mitigation.

Method: Proposes Fine-grained Cross-modal Causal Tracing (FCCT) framework that systematically quantifies causal effects on visual object perception, analyzing visual/textual tokens, MHSA, FFNs, and hidden states across all decoder layers. Based on findings, develops Intermediate Representation Injection (IRI) - a training-free inference-time technique that reinforces visual object information flow by intervening on cross-modal representations at specific components and layers.

Result: FCCT reveals that MHSAs of last token in middle layers play critical role in cross-modal information aggregation, while FFNs show three-stage hierarchical progression for visual object representation storage/transfer. IRI achieves state-of-the-art performance across five benchmarks, improves perception, mitigates hallucination, preserves inference speed and other foundational performance.

Conclusion: The comprehensive mechanistic analysis provides actionable insights for improving LVLM faithfulness, and the proposed IRI technique effectively enhances visual perception and reduces hallucination without requiring training or compromising other model capabilities.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable advancements of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), the mechanistic interpretability remains underexplored. Existing analyses are insufficiently comprehensive and lack examination covering visual and textual tokens, model components, and the full range of layers. This limitation restricts actionable insights to improve the faithfulness of model output and the development of downstream tasks, such as hallucination mitigation. To address this limitation, we introduce Fine-grained Cross-modal Causal Tracing (FCCT) framework, which systematically quantifies the causal effects on visual object perception. FCCT conducts fine-grained analysis covering the full range of visual and textual tokens, three core model components including multi-head self-attention (MHSA), feed-forward networks (FFNs), and hidden states, across all decoder layers. Our analysis is the first to demonstrate that MHSAs of the last token in middle layers play a critical role in aggregating cross-modal information, while FFNs exhibit a three-stage hierarchical progression for the storage and transfer of visual object representations. Building on these insights, we propose Intermediate Representation Injection (IRI), a training-free inference-time technique that reinforces visual object information flow by precisely intervening on cross-modal representations at specific components and layers, thereby enhancing perception and mitigating hallucination. Consistent improvements across five widely used benchmarks and LVLMs demonstrate IRI achieves state-of-the-art performance, while preserving inference speed and other foundational performance.

*Jiaxuan Li,Qing Xu,Xiangjian He,Ziyu Liu,Chang Xing,Zhen Chen,Daokun Zhang,Rong Qu,Chang Wen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoMA uses complementary masking for uniform pixel sampling to improve feature learning, while DyViT employs dynamic multi-window attention to reduce parameters and FLOPs, achieving MAE-level performance with only 12% of pre-training epochs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAE requires many pre-training epochs and ViT suffers from inefficient parameter use due to fixed spatial resolution, limiting training efficiency and adaptability.

Method: Proposed Complementary Masked Autoencoders (CoMA) with uniform pixel sampling strategy, and DyViT with Dynamic Multi-Window Self-Attention for hierarchical vision processing.

Result: CoMA-trained DyViT matches MAE performance using only 12% pre-training epochs, achieves 10% reduction in pre-training time per epoch, and reduces parameters/FLOPs while improving fine-grained features.

Conclusion: The proposed CoMA and DyViT framework significantly improves pre-training efficiency and model adaptability while maintaining downstream task performance.

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAE) achieve self-supervised learning of image representations by randomly removing a portion of visual tokens and reconstructing the original image as a pretext task, thereby significantly enhancing pretraining efficiency and yielding excellent adaptability across downstream tasks. However, MAE and other MAE-style paradigms that adopt random masking generally require more pre-training epochs to maintain adaptability. Meanwhile, ViT in MAE suffers from inefficient parameter use due to fixed spatial resolution across layers. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Complementary Masked Autoencoders (CoMA), which employ a complementary masking strategy to ensure uniform sampling across all pixels, thereby improving effective learning of all features and enhancing the model's adaptability. Furthermore, we introduce DyViT, a hierarchical vision transformer that employs a Dynamic Multi-Window Self-Attention (DM-MSA), significantly reducing the parameters and FLOPs while improving fine-grained feature learning. Pre-trained on ImageNet-1K with CoMA, DyViT matches the downstream performance of MAE using only 12% of the pre-training epochs, demonstrating more effective learning. It also attains a 10% reduction in pre-training time per epoch, further underscoring its superior pre-training efficiency.

*Ayantika Das,Arunima Sarkar,Keerthi Ram,Mohanasankar Sivaprakasam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A conditionable Diffusion Auto-encoder framework is introduced for unsupervised longitudinal disease progression modeling, enabling controlled generation of follow-up images from baseline images without requiring subject-specific longitudinal supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative approaches impose constraints on distribution learning, leading to latent spaces with limited controllability for generating follow-up images without explicit supervision from subject-specific longitudinal images.

Method: The approach uses a conditionable Diffusion Auto-encoder framework that forms a compact latent space capturing high-level semantics, allowing disentanglement of progression-relevant information. It applies controlled shifts to baseline representations within a restricted subspace to isolate progression factors from identity-preserving components.

Result: The method is validated through image quality metrics, volumetric progression analysis, and downstream classification in Alzheimer's disease datasets from two different sources and disease categories, demonstrating effectiveness for Alzheimer's progression modeling.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables controlled movements in latent space and generates progression images from baseline images in an unsupervised manner, correlating with progression attributes without requiring subject-specific longitudinal supervision.

Abstract: Generative modeling frameworks have emerged as an effective approach to capture high-dimensional image distributions from large datasets without requiring domain-specific knowledge, a capability essential for longitudinal disease progression modeling. Recent generative modeling approaches have attempted to capture progression by mapping images into a latent representational space and then controlling and guiding the representations to generate follow-up images from a baseline image. However, existing approaches impose constraints on distribution learning, leading to latent spaces with limited controllability to generate follow-up images without explicit supervision from subject-specific longitudinal images. In order to enable controlled movements in the latent representational space and generate progression images from a baseline image in an unsupervised manner, we introduce a conditionable Diffusion Auto-encoder framework. The explicit encoding mechanism of image-diffusion auto-encoders forms a compact latent space capturing high-level semantics, providing means to disentangle information relevant for progression. Our approach leverages this latent space to condition and apply controlled shifts to baseline representations for generating follow-up. Controllability is induced by restricting these shifts to a subspace, thereby isolating progression-related factors from subject identity-preserving components. The shifts are implicitly guided by correlating with progression attributes, without requiring subject-specific longitudinal supervision. We validate the generations through image quality metrics, volumetric progression analysis, and downstream classification in Alzheimer's disease datasets from two different sources and disease categories. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach for Alzheimer's progression modeling and longitudinal image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ACC is an interaction-centric end-to-end framework for open-vocabulary scene graph generation that addresses limitations in existing methods by focusing on interaction modeling through bidirectional interaction prompts for knowledge infusion and interaction-guided query selection with knowledge distillation for knowledge transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OVSGG methods struggle to distinguish between interacting and non-interacting instances of the same object category due to lack of explicit interaction modeling, leading to noisy pseudo-supervision and ambiguous query matching in both knowledge infusion and transfer stages.

Method: Proposes ACC framework with: 1) Bidirectional interaction prompt for robust pseudo-supervision generation in knowledge infusion; 2) Interaction-guided query selection prioritizing interacting objects; 3) Interaction-consistent knowledge distillation to separate relational foreground from background while retaining general knowledge.

Result: Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show ACC achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of interaction-centric paradigms for real-world OVSGG applications.

Conclusion: The interaction-centric paradigm proposed in ACC effectively addresses key limitations in OVSGG by enhancing interaction modeling, leading to improved performance and demonstrating potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary scene graph generation (OVSGG) extends traditional SGG by recognizing novel objects and relationships beyond predefined categories, leveraging the knowledge from pre-trained large-scale models. Existing OVSGG methods always adopt a two-stage pipeline: 1) \textit{Infusing knowledge} into large-scale models via pre-training on large datasets; 2) \textit{Transferring knowledge} from pre-trained models with fully annotated scene graphs during supervised fine-tuning. However, due to a lack of explicit interaction modeling, these methods struggle to distinguish between interacting and non-interacting instances of the same object category. This limitation induces critical issues in both stages of OVSGG: it generates noisy pseudo-supervision from mismatched objects during knowledge infusion, and causes ambiguous query matching during knowledge transfer. To this end, in this paper, we propose an inter\textbf{AC}tion-\textbf{C}entric end-to-end OVSGG framework (\textbf{ACC}) in an interaction-driven paradigm to minimize these mismatches. For \textit{interaction-centric knowledge infusion}, ACC employs a bidirectional interaction prompt for robust pseudo-supervision generation to enhance the model's interaction knowledge. For \textit{interaction-centric knowledge transfer}, ACC first adopts interaction-guided query selection that prioritizes pairing interacting objects to reduce interference from non-interacting ones. Then, it integrates interaction-consistent knowledge distillation to bolster robustness by pushing relational foreground away from the background while retaining general knowledge. Extensive experimental results on three benchmarks show that ACC achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the potential of interaction-centric paradigms for real-world applications.

TL;DR: GME-Net is a novel network for low-resolution facial expression recognition that addresses detail loss and weak global modeling through hybrid attention-based local feature extraction and multi-scale global feature extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current facial expression recognition methods perform well on high-resolution images but degrade significantly on low-resolution images due to lack of detail information and weak global modeling capabilities.

Method: Proposed GME-Net with: 1) hybrid attention-based local feature extraction module with attention similarity knowledge distillation to learn details from high-resolution networks, 2) multi-scale global feature extraction module with quasi-symmetric structure to mitigate local noise and capture global features.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show GME-Net achieves superior performance in low-resolution facial expression recognition compared to existing solutions.

Conclusion: GME-Net effectively extracts expression-related discriminative features from low-resolution images and outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition, as a vital computer vision task, is garnering significant attention and undergoing extensive research. Although facial expression recognition algorithms demonstrate impressive performance on high-resolution images, their effectiveness tends to degrade when confronted with low-resolution images. We find it is because: 1) low-resolution images lack detail information; 2) current methods complete weak global modeling, which make it difficult to extract discriminative features. To alleviate the above issues, we proposed a novel global multiple extraction network (GME-Net) for low-resolution facial expression recognition, which incorporates 1) a hybrid attention-based local feature extraction module with attention similarity knowledge distillation to learn image details from high-resolution network; 2) a multi-scale global feature extraction module with quasi-symmetric structure to mitigate the influence of local image noise and facilitate capturing global image features. As a result, our GME-Net is capable of extracting expression-related discriminative features. Extensive experiments conducted on several widely-used datasets demonstrate that the proposed GME-Net can better recognize low-resolution facial expression and obtain superior performance than existing solutions.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a segmentation-based method for HD map construction that improves generalizability by treating road elements as rasterized polygons and using instance segmentation with post-processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detection-based methods for online HD map construction lack robust generalizability, which limits their use in auto-labeling systems. The authors aim to improve generalizability.

Method: Reinterpret road elements as rasterized polygons, use a segmentation-based transformer for instance masks in end-to-end manner, followed by Potrace-based post-processing to yield vectorized map elements.

Result: Quantitative results on Nuscene dataset substantiate the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed method.

Conclusion: The segmentation-based approach with rasterized polygons and post-processing provides better generalizability for HD map construction compared to detection-based methods.

Abstract: The perception of high-definition maps is an integral component of environmental perception in autonomous driving systems. Existing research have often focused on online construction of high-definition maps. For instance, the Maptr[9] series employ a detection-based method to output vectorized map instances parallelly in an end-to-end manner. However, despite their capability for real-time construction, detection-based methods are observed to lack robust generalizability[19], which hampers their applicability in auto-labeling systems. Therefore, aiming to improve the generalizability, we reinterpret road elements as rasterized polygons and design a concise framework based on instance segmentation. Initially, a segmentation-based transformer is employed to deliver instance masks in an end-to-end manner; succeeding this step, a Potrace-based[17] post-processing module is used to ultimately yield vectorized map elements. Quantitative results attained on the Nuscene[1] dataset substantiate the effectiveness and generaliz-ability of our method.

Conclusion: Reperio-rPPG effectively bridges the gap in modeling intrinsic periodicity in rPPG signals, achieving superior performance and robustness across diverse real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is an emerging contactless physiological sensing technique that leverages subtle color variations in facial videos to estimate vital signs such as heart rate and respiratory rate. This non-invasive method has gained traction across diverse domains, including telemedicine, affective computing, driver fatigue detection, and health monitoring, owing to its scalability and convenience. Despite significant progress in remote physiological signal measurement, a crucial characteristic - the intrinsic periodicity - has often been underexplored or insufficiently modeled in previous approaches, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained temporal dynamics under real-world conditions. To bridge this gap, we propose Reperio-rPPG, a novel framework that strategically integrates Relational Convolutional Networks with a Graph Transformer to effectively capture the periodic structure inherent in physiological signals. Additionally, recognizing the limited diversity of existing rPPG datasets, we further introduce a tailored CutMix augmentation to enhance the model's generalizability. Extensive experiments conducted on three widely used benchmark datasets - PURE, UBFC-rPPG, and MMPD - demonstrate that Reperio-rPPG not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also exhibits remarkable robustness under various motion (e.g., stationary, rotation, talking, walking) and illumination conditions (e.g., nature, low LED, high LED).

Conclusion: The proposed U(PM)^2 method successfully addresses key challenges in polygon matching through unsupervised learning with pre-trained models, demonstrating superior performance and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Stereo image matching is a fundamental task in computer vision, photogrammetry and remote sensing, but there is an almost unexplored field, i.e., polygon matching, which faces the following challenges: disparity discontinuity, scale variation, training requirement, and generalization. To address the above-mentioned issues, this paper proposes a novel U(PM)$^2$: low-cost unsupervised polygon matching with pre-trained models by uniting automatically learned and handcrafted features, of which pipeline is as follows: firstly, the detector leverages the pre-trained segment anything model to obtain masks; then, the vectorizer converts the masks to polygons and graphic structure; secondly, the global matcher addresses challenges from global viewpoint changes and scale variation based on bidirectional-pyramid strategy with pre-trained LoFTR; finally, the local matcher further overcomes local disparity discontinuity and topology inconsistency of polygon matching by local-joint geometry and multi-feature matching strategy with Hungarian algorithm. We benchmark our U(PM)$^2$ on the ScanNet and SceneFlow datasets using our proposed new metric, which achieved state-of-the-art accuracy at a competitive speed and satisfactory generalization performance at low cost without any training requirement.

TL;DR: A novel cross-modal registration framework using Iterative Agents Selection and Reliable Agents Interaction modules to improve robustness and accuracy in challenging image-to-point cloud registration scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing detection-free methods struggle with noise disrupting similarity computation and lack effective cross-modal representation selection, limiting registration robustness and accuracy.

Method: Proposes IAS module with phase maps for structural feature awareness and reinforcement learning for agent selection, plus RAI module for guided cross-modal interactions to reduce mismatches.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on RGB-D Scenes v2 and 7-Scenes benchmarks, demonstrating consistent improvement over existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses cross-modal registration challenges by enhancing feature awareness and reliable agent selection, leading to improved robustness and accuracy.

Abstract: Typical detection-free methods for image-to-point cloud registration leverage transformer-based architectures to aggregate cross-modal features and establish correspondences. However, they often struggle under challenging conditions, where noise disrupts similarity computation and leads to incorrect correspondences. Moreover, without dedicated designs, it remains difficult to effectively select informative and correlated representations across modalities, thereby limiting the robustness and accuracy of registration. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cross-modal registration framework composed of two key modules: the Iterative Agents Selection (IAS) module and the Reliable Agents Interaction (RAI) module. IAS enhances structural feature awareness with phase maps and employs reinforcement learning principles to efficiently select reliable agents. RAI then leverages these selected agents to guide cross-modal interactions, effectively reducing mismatches and improving overall robustness. Extensive experiments on the RGB-D Scenes v2 and 7-Scenes benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on MVTec 3D-AD and Eyecandies datasets in few-shot settings.

Conclusion: CIF effectively addresses few-shot multimodal industrial anomaly detection by leveraging structural commonality through hypergraphs and memory banks, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Few-shot multimodal industrial anomaly detection is a critical yet underexplored task, offering the ability to quickly adapt to complex industrial scenarios. In few-shot settings, insufficient training samples often fail to cover the diverse patterns present in test samples. This challenge can be mitigated by extracting structural commonality from a small number of training samples. In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot unsupervised multimodal industrial anomaly detection method based on structural commonality, CIF (Commonality In Few). To extract intra-class structural information, we employ hypergraphs, which are capable of modeling higher-order correlations, to capture the structural commonality within training samples, and use a memory bank to store this intra-class structural prior. Firstly, we design a semantic-aware hypergraph construction module tailored for single-semantic industrial images, from which we extract common structures to guide the construction of the memory bank. Secondly, we use a training-free hypergraph message passing module to update the visual features of test samples, reducing the distribution gap between test features and features in the memory bank. We further propose a hyperedge-guided memory search module, which utilizes structural information to assist the memory search process and reduce the false positive rate. Experimental results on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset and the Eyecandies dataset show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in few-shot settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DINOv2-based Medical Slice Transformer (MST) was evaluated for pre-screening breast MRI to rule out significant findings (BI-RADS ≥4), achieving 97.5% sensitivity with 19% specificity for contrast-enhanced and 17% for non-contrast-enhanced protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI has high sensitivity for breast cancer but interpretation is time-consuming; AI could aid in pre-screening to reduce radiologist workload.

Method: Retrospective study of 1,847 MRI exams using DINOv2-based MST on four abbreviated protocols (T1sub, DWI1500, DWI1500+T2w, T1sub+T2w). Performance assessed at 90%, 95%, and 97.5% sensitivity using five-fold cross-validation and AUC analysis.

Result: T1sub+T2w achieved AUC of 0.77±0.04, highest specificity of 19%±7% at 97.5% sensitivity. Missed lesions were small (<10mm) non-mass enhancements. External validation AUC was 0.77 with 88% good/moderate attention maps.

Conclusion: MST framework can correctly triage cases without significant findings at 97.5% sensitivity, achieving modest specificity. Further research needed before clinical implementation.

Abstract: Background: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has high sensitivity for breast cancer detection, but interpretation is time-consuming. Artificial intelligence may aid in pre-screening. Purpose: To evaluate the DINOv2-based Medical Slice Transformer (MST) for ruling out significant findings (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System [BI-RADS] >=4) in contrast-enhanced and non-contrast-enhanced abbreviated breast MRI. Materials and Methods: This institutional review board approved retrospective study included 1,847 single-breast MRI examinations (377 BI-RADS >=4) from an in-house dataset and 924 from an external validation dataset (Duke). Four abbreviated protocols were tested: T1-weighted early subtraction (T1sub), diffusion-weighted imaging with b=1500 s/mm2 (DWI1500), DWI1500+T2-weighted (T2w), and T1sub+T2w. Performance was assessed at 90%, 95%, and 97.5% sensitivity using five-fold cross-validation and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis. AUC differences were compared with the DeLong test. False negatives were characterized, and attention maps of true positives were rated in the external dataset. Results: A total of 1,448 female patients (mean age, 49 +/- 12 years) were included. T1sub+T2w achieved an AUC of 0.77 +/- 0.04; DWI1500+T2w, 0.74 +/- 0.04 (p=0.15). At 97.5% sensitivity, T1sub+T2w had the highest specificity (19% +/- 7%), followed by DWI1500+T2w (17% +/- 11%). Missed lesions had a mean diameter <10 mm at 95% and 97.5% thresholds for both T1sub and DWI1500, predominantly non-mass enhancements. External validation yielded an AUC of 0.77, with 88% of attention maps rated good or moderate. Conclusion: At 97.5% sensitivity, the MST framework correctly triaged cases without BI-RADS >=4, achieving 19% specificity for contrast-enhanced and 17% for non-contrast-enhanced MRI. Further research is warranted before clinical implementation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot object navigation methods depend on depth sensors or prebuilt maps, limiting spatial reasoning, while mapless approaches suffer from short-sighted decisions and local deadlocks due to lack of historical context.

Method: Integrates a Panoramic Scene Parsing module to unlock MLLMs' spatial parsing from panoramic RGB inputs, and a Memory-guided Decision-Making mechanism with Dynamic Bounded Memory Queue to incorporate exploration history and avoid local deadlocks.

Result: Experiments on public navigation benchmark show PanoNav significantly outperforms representative baselines in both Success Rate (SR) and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) metrics.

Conclusion: PanoNav demonstrates that fully RGB-only, mapless zero-shot object navigation is achievable through effective panoramic scene parsing and memory-guided decision-making, overcoming limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) in unseen environments remains a challenging problem for household robots, requiring strong perceptual understanding and decision-making capabilities. While recent methods leverage metric maps and Large Language Models (LLMs), they often depend on depth sensors or prebuilt maps, limiting the spatial reasoning ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Mapless ZSON approaches have emerged to address this, but they typically make short-sighted decisions, leading to local deadlocks due to a lack of historical context. We propose PanoNav, a fully RGB-only, mapless ZSON framework that integrates a Panoramic Scene Parsing module to unlock the spatial parsing potential of MLLMs from panoramic RGB inputs, and a Memory-guided Decision-Making mechanism enhanced by a Dynamic Bounded Memory Queue to incorporate exploration history and avoid local deadlocks. Experiments on the public navigation benchmark show that PanoNav significantly outperforms representative baselines in both SR and SPL metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated radiology reporting methods struggle with missing clinical context and feature entanglement, leading to suboptimal fusion and clinically unfaithful hallucinations in real-world clinical data.

Method: Uses a Mixture-of-Experts based Vision-Language Variational Autoencoder to disentangle shared and modality-specific features, with constrained optimization for orthogonality and alignment, followed by a compact LLaMA-X decoder for efficient report generation.

Result: Achieved competitive BLEU@4 scores of 0.266 on IU X-Ray and 0.134 on MIMIC-CXR datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The proposed DiA framework demonstrates robust performance in radiology reporting by effectively handling missing modalities and feature entanglement through disentangled alignment.

Abstract: The integration of medical images with clinical context is essential for generating accurate and clinically interpretable radiology reports. However, current automated methods often rely on resource-heavy Large Language Models (LLMs) or static knowledge graphs and struggle with two fundamental challenges in real-world clinical data: (1) missing modalities, such as incomplete clinical context , and (2) feature entanglement, where mixed modality-specific and shared information leads to suboptimal fusion and clinically unfaithful hallucinated findings. To address these challenges, we propose the DiA-gnostic VLVAE, which achieves robust radiology reporting through Disentangled Alignment. Our framework is designed to be resilient to missing modalities by disentangling shared and modality-specific features using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) based Vision-Language Variational Autoencoder (VLVAE). A constrained optimization objective enforces orthogonality and alignment between these latent representations to prevent suboptimal fusion. A compact LLaMA-X decoder then uses these disentangled representations to generate reports efficiently. On the IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR datasets, DiA has achieved competetive BLEU@4 scores of 0.266 and 0.134, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models.

TL;DR: A novel UAV image stitching method combining IMU data with computer vision techniques to improve accuracy and robustness over traditional feature-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature-based image stitching algorithms for UAV aerial photography often suffer from errors in feature detection and matching, especially with large displacements and rotations.

Method: Combines IMU data with computer vision: estimates UAV displacement/rotation between images, corrects perspective distortion, computes homography matrix, and uses standard stitching for alignment/blending.

Result: Method outperforms existing feature-based algorithms in accuracy and reliability, particularly in challenging scenarios with large displacements, rotations, and camera pose variations.

Conclusion: The IMU-assisted approach provides more robust and accurate image stitching that can be easily integrated into existing UAV workflows.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are widely used for aerial photography and remote sensing applications. One of the main challenges is to stitch together multiple images into a single high-resolution image that covers a large area. Featurebased image stitching algorithms are commonly used but can suffer from errors and ambiguities in feature detection and matching. To address this, several approaches have been proposed, including using bundle adjustment techniques or direct image alignment. In this paper, we present a novel method that uses a combination of IMU data and computer vision techniques for stitching images captured by a UAV. Our method involves several steps such as estimating the displacement and rotation of the UAV between consecutive images, correcting for perspective distortion, and computing a homography matrix. We then use a standard image stitching algorithm to align and blend the images together. Our proposed method leverages the additional information provided by the IMU data, corrects for various sources of distortion, and can be easily integrated into existing UAV workflows. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, outperforming some of the existing feature-based image stitching algorithms in terms of accuracy and reliability, particularly in challenging scenarios such as large displacements, rotations, and variations in camera pose.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluation metrics on KITTI dataset, outperforming even uncertainty-enhanced baselines while maintaining single-pass efficiency for real-time deployment.

Conclusion: The dual-domain approach effectively handles uncertainty through architectural design rather than computationally expensive stochastic inference, making it practical for autonomous systems.

Abstract: LiDAR super-resolution addresses the challenge of achieving high-quality 3D perception from cost-effective, low-resolution sensors. While recent transformer-based approaches like TULIP show promise, they remain limited to spatial-domain processing with restricted receptive fields. We introduce FLASH (Frequency-aware LiDAR Adaptive Super-resolution with Hierarchical fusion), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations through dual-domain processing. FLASH integrates two key innovations: (i) Frequency-Aware Window Attention that combines local spatial attention with global frequency-domain analysis via FFT, capturing both fine-grained geometry and periodic scanning patterns at log-linear complexity. (ii) Adaptive Multi-Scale Fusion that replaces conventional skip connections with learned position-specific feature aggregation, enhanced by CBAM attention for dynamic feature selection. Extensive experiments on KITTI demonstrate that FLASH achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluation metrics, surpassing even uncertainty-enhanced baselines that require multiple forward passes. Notably, FLASH outperforms TULIP with Monte Carlo Dropout while maintaining single-pass efficiency, which enables real-time deployment. The consistent superiority across all distance ranges validates that our dual-domain approach effectively handles uncertainty through architectural design rather than computationally expensive stochastic inference, making it practical for autonomous systems.

Motivation: Breast ultrasound lesion segmentation is challenging due to low contrast, speckle noise, and unclear boundaries. Standard convolutional architectures fail to capture sufficient global context, leading to anatomically inconsistent segmentations.

Method: Flexible conditional Denoising Diffusion Model with ViT encoder for global features and enhanced UNet decoder. Key innovations: Adaptive Conditioning Bridge for multi-scale feature fusion, Topological Denoising Consistency loss for structural regularization, and dual-head architecture for efficient inference.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art performance with Dice scores of 0.96 on BUSI, 0.90 on BrEaST, and 0.97 on BUS-UCLM datasets. Ablation studies confirm critical importance of all model components.

Conclusion: The proposed framework produces not only accurate but also anatomically plausible segmentations, establishing a new benchmark for breast ultrasound lesion segmentation through effective combination of diffusion models and transformer architectures.

Abstract: In breast ultrasound images, precise lesion segmentation is essential for early diagnosis; however, low contrast, speckle noise, and unclear boundaries make this difficult. Even though deep learning models have demonstrated potential, standard convolutional architectures frequently fall short in capturing enough global context, resulting in segmentations that are anatomically inconsistent. To overcome these drawbacks, we suggest a flexible, conditional Denoising Diffusion Model that combines an enhanced UNet-based generative decoder with a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder for global feature extraction. We introduce three primary innovations: 1) an Adaptive Conditioning Bridge (ACB) for efficient, multi-scale fusion of semantic features; 2) a novel Topological Denoising Consistency (TDC) loss component that regularizes training by penalizing structural inconsistencies during denoising; and 3) a dual-head architecture that leverages the denoising objective as a powerful regularizer, enabling a lightweight auxiliary head to perform rapid and accurate inference on smaller datasets and a noise prediction head. Our framework establishes a new state-of-the-art on public breast ultrasound datasets, achieving Dice scores of 0.96 on BUSI, 0.90 on BrEaST and 0.97 on BUS-UCLM. Comprehensive ablation studies empirically validate that the model components are critical for achieving these results and for producing segmentations that are not only accurate but also anatomically plausible.

Abstract: Developing embodied AI for intelligent surgical systems requires safe, controllable environments for continual learning and evaluation. However, safety regulations and operational constraints in operating rooms (ORs) limit embodied agents from freely perceiving and interacting in realistic settings. Digital twins provide high-fidelity, risk-free environments for exploration and training. How we may create photorealistic and dynamic digital representations of ORs that capture relevant spatial, visual, and behavioral complexity remains unclear. We introduce TwinOR, a framework for constructing photorealistic, dynamic digital twins of ORs for embodied AI research.

Abstract: Articulated objects are prevalent in daily life and robotic manipulation tasks. However, compared to rigid objects, pose tracking for articulated objects remains an underexplored problem due to their inherent kinematic constraints. To address these challenges, this work proposes a novel point-pair-based pose tracking framework, termed \textbf{PPF-Tracker}. The proposed framework first performs quasi-canonicalization of point clouds in the SE(3) Lie group space, and then models articulated objects using Point Pair Features (PPF) to predict pose voting parameters by leveraging the invariance properties of SE(3). Finally, semantic information of joint axes is incorporated to impose unified kinematic constraints across all parts of the articulated object.

*Shivank Saxena,Dhruv Srivastava,Makarand Tapaswi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MALeR is a method that addresses challenges in layout-guided text-to-image generation by preventing subjects from appearing outside layouts, ensuring in-distribution generation, and using masked attribute-aware binding to prevent attribute leakage in complex compositional scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current layout-guided text-to-image methods struggle with compositional scenes, often generating unintended subjects outside layouts, producing out-of-distribution images with artifacts, and suffering from attribute bleeding across subjects.

Method: MALeR uses a masked, attribute-aware binding mechanism that prevents attribute leakage and ensures subjects appear only within specified layouts while maintaining in-distribution generation quality.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative evaluations show MALeR achieves superior performance in compositional accuracy, generation consistency, and attribute binding compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: MALeR effectively generates complex compositional scenes with multiple subjects and multiple attributes per subject, addressing key limitations of existing layout-guided text-to-image generation approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image models have enabled a new era of creative and controllable image generation. However, generating compositional scenes with multiple subjects and attributes remains a significant challenge. To enhance user control over subject placement, several layout-guided methods have been proposed. However, these methods face numerous challenges, particularly in compositional scenes. Unintended subjects often appear outside the layouts, generated images can be out-of-distribution and contain unnatural artifacts, or attributes bleed across subjects, leading to incorrect visual outputs. In this work, we propose MALeR, a method that addresses each of these challenges. Given a text prompt and corresponding layouts, our method prevents subjects from appearing outside the given layouts while being in-distribution. Additionally, we propose a masked, attribute-aware binding mechanism that prevents attribute leakage, enabling accurate rendering of subjects with multiple attributes, even in complex compositional scenes. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation demonstrates that our method achieves superior performance in compositional accuracy, generation consistency, and attribute binding compared to previous work. MALeR is particularly adept at generating images of scenes with multiple subjects and multiple attributes per subject.

*Adit Desai,Sudipta Roy,Mohna Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Analysis of social biases in 5 open-source Vision Language Models (VLMs) for occupation prediction tasks, revealing systematic intersectional disparities in reasoning patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs are increasingly deployed but their training data encode social biases that surface in outputs, and their statistical processing diverges from human contextual reasoning, potentially perpetuating harmful biases in downstream applications.

Method: Systematically analyzed social biases in five open-source VLMs using FairFace dataset for occupation prediction task across 32 occupations and three different prompting styles, eliciting both predictions and reasoning.

Result: Findings reveal that biased reasoning patterns systematically underlie intersectional disparities in VLM outputs.

Conclusion: There is a critical need to align VLM reasoning with human values prior to downstream deployment to mitigate harmful social biases.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed across downstream tasks, yet their training data often encode social biases that surface in outputs. Unlike humans, who interpret images through contextual and social cues, VLMs process them through statistical associations, often leading to reasoning that diverges from human reasoning. By analyzing how a VLM reasons, we can understand how inherent biases are perpetuated and can adversely affect downstream performance. To examine this gap, we systematically analyze social biases in five open-source VLMs for an occupation prediction task, on the FairFace dataset. Across 32 occupations and three different prompting styles, we elicit both predictions and reasoning. Our findings reveal that the biased reasoning patterns systematically underlie intersectional disparities, highlighting the need to align VLM reasoning with human values prior to its downstream deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Distributed deep learning for denoising chest X-rays using U-Net and U-Net++ with optimized multi-GPU training (DDP+AMP) achieves 60% faster training with minor accuracy trade-offs, demonstrating practical viability for clinical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve medical image quality while protecting sensitive information in large-scale clinical datasets, using lightweight obfuscation techniques and distributed training for efficiency.

Method: Implemented U-Net and U-Net++ architectures with additive Gaussian noise for obfuscation, evaluated under single-GPU, DataParallel, and optimized multi-GPU configurations using PyTorch's DistributedDataParallel (DDP) and Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP).

Result: U-Net++ delivered superior denoising with better PSNR and SSIM scores but lower LPIPS. Optimized training reduced time by over 60% vs single-GPU and 40% vs DataParallel, with minor accuracy drops.

Conclusion: Combining architectural design, lightweight obfuscation, and advanced distributed training strategies provides effective and practical solutions for accelerating medical image processing in clinical environments.

Abstract: Medical image denoising is essential for improving image quality while minimizing the exposure of sensitive information, particularly when working with large-scale clinical datasets. This study explores distributed deep learning for denoising chest X-ray images from the NIH Chest X-ray14 dataset, using additive Gaussian noise as a lightweight obfuscation technique. We implement and evaluate U-Net and U-Net++ architectures under single-GPU, standard multi-GPU (DataParallel), and optimized multi-GPU training configurations using PyTorch's DistributedDataParallel (DDP) and Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP). Our results show that U-Net++ consistently delivers superior denoising performance, achieving competitive Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structured Similarity Index Method (SSIM) scores, though with less performance in Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) compared to U-Net under low and moderate noise levels. This indicates U-Net++'s enhanced structural fidelity and low perceptual similarity. Meanwhile, our optimized training pipeline reduces training time by over 60% for both models compared to single-GPU training, and outperforms standard DataParallel by over 40%, with only a minor accuracy drop for both models (trading some accuracy for speed). These findings highlight the effectiveness of software-level optimization in distributed learning for medical imaging. This work demonstrates the practical viability of combining architectural design, lightweight obfuscation, and advanced distributed training strategies to accelerate and enhance medical image processing pipelines in real-world clinical and research environments.

TL;DR: OSKT enables one-shot knowledge transfer for person ReID models using a weight chain approach, eliminating repetitive computations when multiple model sizes are needed for different edge computing scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge computing in person ReID requires multiple model sizes for different resource constraints, but conventional compression methods require repetitive computations for each individual student model, which is inefficient.

Method: Proposed OSKT (One-Shot Knowledge Transfer) that consolidates teacher model knowledge into an intermediate weight chain, which can be expanded to target model sizes without additional computation.

Result: OSKT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art compression methods while providing the advantage of one-time knowledge transfer that eliminates frequent computations for each target model.

Conclusion: OSKT provides an efficient solution for deploying person ReID models in edge computing scenarios by enabling flexible model sizing through one-shot knowledge transfer, reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Edge computing in person re-identification (ReID) is crucial for reducing the load on central cloud servers and ensuring user privacy. Conventional compression methods for obtaining compact models require computations for each individual student model. When multiple models of varying sizes are needed to accommodate different resource conditions, this leads to repetitive and cumbersome computations. To address this challenge, we propose a novel knowledge inheritance approach named OSKT (One-Shot Knowledge Transfer), which consolidates the knowledge of the teacher model into an intermediate carrier called a weight chain. When a downstream scenario demands a model that meets specific resource constraints, this weight chain can be expanded to the target model size without additional computation. OSKT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art compression methods, with the added advantage of one-time knowledge transfer that eliminates the need for frequent computations for each target model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MiVID is a lightweight, self-supervised diffusion-based framework for video frame interpolation that eliminates explicit motion estimation, uses progressive masking to simulate occlusions, and achieves competitive performance without high-frame-rate supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical VFI methods struggle with occlusions, domain shifts, and ambiguous motion, while learning-based approaches require dense ground-truth data. The authors aim to develop a self-supervised solution that overcomes these limitations.

Method: Combines 3D U-Net backbone with transformer-style temporal attention, trained under hybrid masking regime with cosine-based progressive masking and adaptive loss scheduling to simulate occlusions and motion uncertainty.

Result: Achieves optimal results at 50 epochs on UCF101-7 and DAVIS-7 datasets, competitive with supervised baselines despite being trained entirely on CPU with low-resource constraints.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the effectiveness of self-supervised diffusion priors for temporally coherent frame synthesis and provides a scalable path toward accessible and generalizable VFI systems.

Abstract: Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) remains a cornerstone in video enhancement, enabling temporal upscaling for tasks like slow-motion rendering, frame rate conversion, and video restoration. While classical methods rely on optical flow and learning-based models assume access to dense ground-truth, both struggle with occlusions, domain shifts, and ambiguous motion. This article introduces MiVID, a lightweight, self-supervised, diffusion-based framework for video interpolation. Our model eliminates the need for explicit motion estimation by combining a 3D U-Net backbone with transformer-style temporal attention, trained under a hybrid masking regime that simulates occlusions and motion uncertainty. The use of cosine-based progressive masking and adaptive loss scheduling allows our network to learn robust spatiotemporal representations without any high-frame-rate supervision. Our framework is evaluated on UCF101-7 and DAVIS-7 datasets. MiVID is trained entirely on CPU using the datasets and 9-frame video segments, making it a low-resource yet highly effective pipeline. Despite these constraints, our model achieves optimal results at just 50 epochs, competitive with several supervised baselines.This work demonstrates the power of self-supervised diffusion priors for temporally coherent frame synthesis and provides a scalable path toward accessible and generalizable VFI systems.

### [76] [Towards Implicit Aggregation: Robust Image Representation for Place Recognition in the Transformer Era](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06024)
*Feng Lu,Tong Jin,Canming Ye,Yunpeng Liu,Xiangyuan Lan,Chun Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes eliminating dedicated aggregators in visual place recognition by using learnable aggregation tokens in transformer backbones, achieving state-of-the-art performance with higher efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors argue that in the transformer era, dedicated aggregators (like NetVLAD) are unnecessary for visual place recognition, as transformers can implicitly aggregate information through self-attention mechanisms.

Method: Introduce learnable aggregation tokens prepended to patch tokens before a specific transformer block; these tokens interact globally via self-attention and are concatenated as the final global descriptor. Also propose optimal token insertion strategy and initialization methods.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several VPR datasets with higher efficiency and ranks 1st on the MSLS challenge leaderboard.

Conclusion: Implicit aggregation through transformer backbones alone can provide robust global descriptors, eliminating the need for dedicated aggregators while achieving superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Visual place recognition (VPR) is typically regarded as a specific image retrieval task, whose core lies in representing images as global descriptors. Over the past decade, dominant VPR methods (e.g., NetVLAD) have followed a paradigm that first extracts the patch features/tokens of the input image using a backbone, and then aggregates these patch features into a global descriptor via an aggregator. This backbone-plus-aggregator paradigm has achieved overwhelming dominance in the CNN era and remains widely used in transformer-based models. In this paper, however, we argue that a dedicated aggregator is not necessary in the transformer era, that is, we can obtain robust global descriptors only with the backbone. Specifically, we introduce some learnable aggregation tokens, which are prepended to the patch tokens before a particular transformer block. All these tokens will be jointly processed and interact globally via the intrinsic self-attention mechanism, implicitly aggregating useful information within the patch tokens to the aggregation tokens. Finally, we only take these aggregation tokens from the last output tokens and concatenate them as the global representation. Although implicit aggregation can provide robust global descriptors in an extremely simple manner, where and how to insert additional tokens, as well as the initialization of tokens, remains an open issue worthy of further exploration. To this end, we also propose the optimal token insertion strategy and token initialization method derived from empirical studies. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several VPR datasets with higher efficiency and ranks 1st on the MSLS challenge leaderboard.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: S2ML is a spatio-spectral mutual learning framework that combines spatial and frequency domain features for depth completion, addressing incomplete depth values in RGB-D images through complementary physical characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Raw depth images from RGB-D cameras often have incomplete depth values due to weak reflections, boundary shadows, and artifacts, limiting their use in vision tasks. Existing methods overlook physical characteristics and frequency distribution patterns affected by invalid depth areas.

Method: Proposes a Spatio-Spectral Mutual Learning (S2ML) framework that harmonizes spatial and frequency domains. Uses dedicated spectral fusion module for amplitude and phase spectra, calculates local and global correlations in unified embedding space, and employs gradual mutual representation and refinement.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art method CFormer by 0.828 dB on NYU-Depth V2 and 0.834 dB on SUN RGB-D datasets, demonstrating effectiveness through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The S2ML framework successfully leverages complementary physical characteristics from both spatial and frequency domains for more accurate depth completion, showing significant performance improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: The raw depth images captured by RGB-D cameras using Time-of-Flight (TOF) or structured light often suffer from incomplete depth values due to weak reflections, boundary shadows, and artifacts, which limit their applications in downstream vision tasks. Existing methods address this problem through depth completion in the image domain, but they overlook the physical characteristics of raw depth images. It has been observed that the presence of invalid depth areas alters the frequency distribution pattern. In this work, we propose a Spatio-Spectral Mutual Learning framework (S2ML) to harmonize the advantages of both spatial and frequency domains for depth completion. Specifically, we consider the distinct properties of amplitude and phase spectra and devise a dedicated spectral fusion module. Meanwhile, the local and global correlations between spatial-domain and frequency-domain features are calculated in a unified embedding space. The gradual mutual representation and refinement encourage the network to fully explore complementary physical characteristics and priors for more accurate depth completion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed S2ML method, outperforming the state-of-the-art method CFormer by 0.828 dB and 0.834 dB on the NYU-Depth V2 and SUN RGB-D datasets, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StreamSTGS is a novel FVV representation that enables real-time streaming by compressing 3D Gaussian attributes into 2D images and temporal features into video, achieving competitive performance with much smaller frame sizes (170KB vs 10MB).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3DGS-based FVV methods have high storage requirements (up to 10MB per frame), making real-time streaming impossible. There's a need for efficient compression while maintaining quality.

Method: Represents dynamic scenes using canonical 3D Gaussians, temporal features, and a deformation field. Encodes Gaussian attributes as 2D images and temporal features as video. Uses sliding window for local motion and transformer-guided auxiliary training for global motion.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on all metrics, increases PSNR by average 1dB while reducing average frame size to 170KB (vs 10MB). Supports adaptive bitrate control without extra training.

Conclusion: StreamSTGS enables real-time FVV streaming with superior compression efficiency and competitive quality, making practical deployment feasible.

Abstract: Streaming free-viewpoint video~(FVV) in real-time still faces significant challenges, particularly in training, rendering, and transmission efficiency. Harnessing superior performance of 3D Gaussian Splatting~(3DGS), recent 3DGS-based FVV methods have achieved notable breakthroughs in both training and rendering. However, the storage requirements of these methods can reach up to $10$MB per frame, making stream FVV in real-time impossible. To address this problem, we propose a novel FVV representation, dubbed StreamSTGS, designed for real-time streaming. StreamSTGS represents a dynamic scene using canonical 3D Gaussians, temporal features, and a deformation field. For high compression efficiency, we encode canonical Gaussian attributes as 2D images and temporal features as a video. This design not only enables real-time streaming, but also inherently supports adaptive bitrate control based on network condition without any extra training. Moreover, we propose a sliding window scheme to aggregate adjacent temporal features to learn local motions, and then introduce a transformer-guided auxiliary training module to learn global motions. On diverse FVV benchmarks, StreamSTGS demonstrates competitive performance on all metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, StreamSTGS increases the PSNR by an average of $1$dB while reducing the average frame size to just $170$KB. The code is publicly available on https://github.com/kkkzh/StreamSTGS.

Conclusion: Neodragon democratizes AI-based video content creation by enabling low-cost, private, on-device text-to-video synthesis without cloud dependency, with code and models being publicly released.

Abstract: We introduce Neodragon, a text-to-video system capable of generating 2s (49 frames @24 fps) videos at the 640x1024 resolution directly on a Qualcomm Hexagon NPU in a record 6.7s (7 FPS). Differing from existing transformer-based offline text-to-video generation models, Neodragon is the first to have been specifically optimised for mobile hardware to achieve efficient and high-fidelity video synthesis. We achieve this through four key technical contributions: (1) Replacing the original large 4.762B T5xxl Text-Encoder with a much smaller 0.2B DT5 (DistilT5) with minimal quality loss, enabled through a novel Text-Encoder Distillation procedure. (2) Proposing an Asymmetric Decoder Distillation approach allowing us to replace the native codec-latent-VAE decoder with a more efficient one, without disturbing the generative latent-space of the generation pipeline. (3) Pruning of MMDiT blocks within the denoiser backbone based on their relative importance, with recovery of original performance through a two-stage distillation process. (4) Reducing the NFE (Neural Functional Evaluation) requirement of the denoiser by performing step distillation using DMD adapted for pyramidal flow-matching, thereby substantially accelerating video generation. When paired with an optimised SSD1B first-frame image generator and QuickSRNet for 2x super-resolution, our end-to-end Neodragon system becomes a highly parameter (4.945B full model), memory (3.5GB peak RAM usage), and runtime (6.7s E2E latency) efficient mobile-friendly model, while achieving a VBench total score of 81.61. By enabling low-cost, private, and on-device text-to-video synthesis, Neodragon democratizes AI-based video content creation, empowering creators to generate high-quality videos without reliance on cloud services.

TL;DR: LoopExpose is an unsupervised exposure correction method using nested loop optimization with pseudo-labels from multi-exposure fusion and a Luminance Ranking Loss for self-supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised learning for exposure correction requires large labeled datasets that are difficult to obtain in practice, creating a need for unsupervised methods that don't rely on ground truth data.

Method: Uses a nested loop optimization with two-level framework: upper-level trains correction model using pseudo-labels from lower-level multi-exposure fusion, with feedback mechanism where corrected images refine pseudo-labels. Includes Luminance Ranking Loss for self-supervised constraint based on relative luminance ordering.

Result: Extensive experiments show LoopExpose achieves superior exposure correction and fusion performance, outperforming existing state-of-the-art unsupervised methods on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed unsupervised method effectively addresses exposure correction without requiring labeled datasets, demonstrating strong performance through the nested loop optimization and self-supervised constraints.

Abstract: Exposure correction is essential for enhancing image quality under challenging lighting conditions. While supervised learning has achieved significant progress in this area, it relies heavily on large-scale labeled datasets, which are difficult to obtain in practical scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a pseudo label-based unsupervised method called LoopExpose for arbitrary-length exposure correction. A nested loop optimization strategy is proposed to address the exposure correction problem, where the correction model and pseudo-supervised information are jointly optimized in a two-level framework. Specifically, the upper-level trains a correction model using pseudo-labels generated through multi-exposure fusion at the lower level. A feedback mechanism is introduced where corrected images are fed back into the fusion process to refine the pseudo-labels, creating a self-reinforcing learning loop. Considering the dominant role of luminance calibration in exposure correction, a Luminance Ranking Loss is introduced to leverage the relative luminance ordering across the input sequence as a self-supervised constraint. Extensive experiments on different benchmark datasets demonstrate that LoopExpose achieves superior exposure correction and fusion performance, outperforming existing state-of-the-art unsupervised methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion blur severely impairs text readability and hinders computer vision tasks like autonomous driving and document digitization. Conventional deblurring methods fail to handle spatially varying blur and lack long-range dependency modeling for text restoration.

Method: Hybrid deep learning framework combining CNNs with vision transformers. Uses CNN encoder-decoder for structural details and transformer module with self-attention for global awareness. Trained on TextOCR dataset with synthetic motion blur using multiple kernel sizes/orientations. Optimized with composite loss (MAE, MSE, perceptual similarity, SSIM).

Result: Achieved 32.20 dB PSNR and 0.934 SSIM with lightweight model (2.83M parameters) and fast inference (61 ms), outperforming conventional methods in text clarity restoration.

Conclusion: The CNN-ViT hybrid design effectively restores motion-blurred scene text with computational efficiency, establishing practicality for real-world applications requiring text readability enhancement.

Abstract: Motion blur in scene text images severely impairs readability and hinders the reliability of computer vision tasks, including autonomous driving, document digitization, and visual information retrieval. Conventional deblurring approaches are often inadequate in handling spatially varying blur and typically fall short in modeling the long-range dependencies necessary for restoring textual clarity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a hybrid deep learning framework that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with vision transformers (ViTs), thereby leveraging both local feature extraction and global contextual reasoning. The architecture employs a CNN-based encoder-decoder to preserve structural details, while a transformer module enhances global awareness through self-attention. Training is conducted on a curated dataset derived from TextOCR, where sharp scene-text samples are paired with synthetically blurred versions generated using realistic motion-blur kernels of multiple sizes and orientations. Model optimization is guided by a composite loss that incorporates mean absolute error (MAE), squared error (MSE), perceptual similarity, and structural similarity (SSIM). Quantitative evaluations show that the proposed method attains 32.20 dB in PSNR and 0.934 in SSIM, while remaining lightweight with 2.83 million parameters and an average inference time of 61 ms. These results highlight the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the CNN-ViT hybrid design, establishing its practicality for real-world motion-blurred scene-text restoration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LFlow is a training-free framework that uses pretrained latent flow priors to solve linear inverse problems more efficiently than diffusion models, operating in latent space with theoretically grounded posterior covariance for better guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current flow-based inverse solvers have limitations: they operate in pixel space (computationally expensive) and use prior-agnostic posterior covariances that weaken alignment with generative trajectories and degrade posterior coverage.

Method: LFlow leverages flow matching to perform ODE sampling in latent space along optimal paths, using pretrained latent flow priors. It introduces a theoretically grounded posterior covariance derived from the optimal vector field for effective flow guidance.

Result: Experimental results show LFlow outperforms state-of-the-art latent diffusion solvers in reconstruction quality across most tasks.

Conclusion: LFlow provides an efficient training-free framework for solving linear inverse problems using latent flow priors with improved guidance and computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in inverse problem solving have increasingly adopted flow priors over diffusion models due to their ability to construct straight probability paths from noise to data, thereby enhancing efficiency in both training and inference. However, current flow-based inverse solvers face two primary limitations: (i) they operate directly in pixel space, which demands heavy computational resources for training and restricts scalability to high-resolution images, and (ii) they employ guidance strategies with prior-agnostic posterior covariances, which can weaken alignment with the generative trajectory and degrade posterior coverage. In this paper, we propose LFlow (Latent Refinement via Flows), a training-free framework for solving linear inverse problems via pretrained latent flow priors. LFlow leverages the efficiency of flow matching to perform ODE sampling in latent space along an optimal path. This latent formulation further allows us to introduce a theoretically grounded posterior covariance, derived from the optimal vector field, enabling effective flow guidance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art latent diffusion solvers in reconstruction quality across most tasks.

*Selim Ahmet Iz,Francesco Nex,Norman Kerle,Henry Meissner,Ralf Berger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A real-time bundle adjustment framework for UAV imagery that processes full-resolution images by dividing them into patches and using GNSS/IMU data with DSM for dynamic tracking, achieving sub-2-second processing without GPU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time UAV image processing is crucial for disaster response but conventional BA methods either sacrifice detail through downsampling or are too slow for time-critical missions.

Method: Divides images into patches, dynamically tracks them using UAV navigation data and DSM, performs localized BA on sliding clusters of overlapping images including adjacent flight strips.

Result: Validated on MACS datasets with 50MP images, maintains precise camera orientations and high-fidelity mapping across multiple strips, runs full BA in under 2 seconds without GPU.

Conclusion: The framework enables real-time, high-accuracy bundle adjustment for UAV imagery suitable for disaster response and other time-critical applications, integrated with DLR MACS system.

Abstract: Real-time processing of UAV imagery is crucial for applications requiring urgent geospatial information, such as disaster response, where rapid decision-making and accurate spatial data are essential. However, processing high-resolution imagery in real time presents significant challenges due to the computational demands of feature extraction, matching, and bundle adjustment (BA). Conventional BA methods either downsample images, sacrificing important details, or require extensive processing time, making them unsuitable for time-critical missions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel real-time BA framework that operates directly on fullresolution UAV imagery without downsampling. Our lightweight, onboard-compatible approach divides each image into user-defined patches (e.g., NxN grids, default 150x150 pixels) and dynamically tracks them across frames using UAV GNSS/IMU data and a coarse, globally available digital surface model (DSM). This ensures spatial consistency for robust feature extraction and matching between patches. Overlapping relationships between images are determined in real time using UAV navigation system, enabling the rapid selection of relevant neighbouring images for localized BA. By limiting optimization to a sliding cluster of overlapping images, including those from adjacent flight strips, the method achieves real-time performance while preserving the accuracy of global BA. The proposed algorithm is designed for seamless integration into the DLR Modular Aerial Camera System (MACS), supporting largearea mapping in real time for disaster response, infrastructure monitoring, and coastal protection. Validation on MACS datasets with 50MP images demonstrates that the method maintains precise camera orientations and high-fidelity mapping across multiple strips, running full bundle adjustment in under 2 seconds without GPU acceleration.

Conclusion: The proposed MambaOVSR effectively addresses the challenges in Chinese opera video restoration through novel global modeling and alignment mechanisms, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Chinese opera is celebrated for preserving classical art. However, early filming equipment limitations have degraded videos of last-century performances by renowned artists (e.g., low frame rates and resolution), hindering archival efforts. Although space-time video super-resolution (STVSR) has advanced significantly, applying it directly to opera videos remains challenging. The scarcity of datasets impedes the recovery of high frequency details, and existing STVSR methods lack global modeling capabilities, compromising visual quality when handling opera's characteristic large motions. To address these challenges, we pioneer a large scale Chinese Opera Video Clip (COVC) dataset and propose the Mamba-based multiscale fusion network for space-time Opera Video Super-Resolution (MambaOVSR). Specifically, MambaOVSR involves three novel components: the Global Fusion Module (GFM) for motion modeling through a multiscale alternating scanning mechanism, and the Multiscale Synergistic Mamba Module (MSMM) for alignment across different sequence lengths. Additionally, our MambaVR block resolves feature artifacts and positional information loss during alignment. Experimental results on the COVC dataset show that MambaOVSR significantly outperforms the SOTA STVSR method by an average of 1.86 dB in terms of PSNR. Dataset and Code will be publicly released.

Conclusion: The framework successfully generates high-fidelity 3D CAD models directly from text using NURBS, with improved robustness and reduced token complexity through hybrid representation.

Abstract: Generating editable 3D CAD models from natural language remains challenging, as existing text-to-CAD systems either produce meshes or rely on scarce design-history data. We present NURBGen, the first framework to generate high-fidelity 3D CAD models directly from text using Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS). To achieve this, we fine-tune a large language model (LLM) to translate free-form texts into JSON representations containing NURBS surface parameters (\textit{i.e}, control points, knot vectors, degrees, and rational weights) which can be directly converted into BRep format using Python. We further propose a hybrid representation that combines untrimmed NURBS with analytic primitives to handle trimmed surfaces and degenerate regions more robustly, while reducing token complexity. Additionally, we introduce partABC, a curated subset of the ABC dataset consisting of individual CAD components, annotated with detailed captions using an automated annotation pipeline. NURBGen demonstrates strong performance on diverse prompts, surpassing prior methods in geometric fidelity and dimensional accuracy, as confirmed by expert evaluations. Code and dataset will be released publicly.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoRA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for vision-language models that handles missing modalities by modeling cross-modal interactions and maintaining modality-specific adaptations, achieving better performance with fewer parameters and faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world scenarios often have missing modalities due to privacy, collection difficulties, or resource limitations, but existing prompt learning approaches fail to capture cross-modal relationships and have computational overhead.

Method: Introduces modality-common parameters between text and vision encoders for bidirectional knowledge transfer, combined with modality-specific parameters to maintain inter-modality interaction and intra-modality flexibility.

Result: Achieves 5.24% average performance improvement in missing-modality scenarios, uses only 25.90% of inference time compared to SOTA, and requires only 0.11% of trainable parameters compared to full fine-tuning.

Conclusion: MoRA effectively addresses missing modality challenges in vision-language models through efficient cross-modal interaction modeling while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision language models have shown remarkable performance on visual recognition tasks, but they typically assume the availability of complete multimodal inputs during both training and inference. In real-world scenarios, however, modalities may be missing due to privacy constraints, collection difficulties, or resource limitations. While previous approaches have addressed this challenge using prompt learning techniques, they fail to capture the cross-modal relationships necessary for effective multimodal visual recognition and suffer from inevitable computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that explicitly models cross-modal interactions while maintaining modality-specific adaptations. MoRA introduces modality-common parameters between text and vision encoders, enabling bidirectional knowledge transfer. Additionally, combined with the modality-specific parameters, MoRA allows the backbone model to maintain inter-modality interaction and enable intra-modality flexibility. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that MoRA achieves an average performance improvement in missing-modality scenarios by 5.24% and uses only 25.90% of the inference time compared to the SOTA method while requiring only 0.11% of trainable parameters compared to full fine-tuning.

Abstract: Event cameras offer unique advantages for vision tasks in challenging environments, yet processing asynchronous event streams remains an open challenge. While existing methods rely on specialized architectures or resource-intensive training, the potential of leveraging modern Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) pretrained on image data remains under-explored for event-based vision. To address this, we propose Temporal-Guided VFM (TGVFM), a novel framework that integrates VFMs with our temporal context fusion block seamlessly to bridge this gap.

TL;DR: Proposes a physics-informed deblurring method using PDE dynamics to model motion blur characteristics, achieving superior restoration with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods struggle with long-range spatial dependencies in motion blur patterns, requiring extremely deep networks. Need approaches that incorporate physical priors to guide feature evolution.

Method: Progressive training framework integrating physics-informed PDE dynamics (advection-diffusion equations) into state-of-the-art restoration architectures to model feature evolution and capture directional flow characteristics.

Result: Achieves superior restoration quality with only ~1% increase in inference GMACs. Improves PSNR and SSIM significantly across four architectures (FFTformer, NAFNet, Restormer, Stripformer) on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: Incorporating mathematical physics principles through PDE-based global layers enhances deep learning-based image restoration, establishing a promising direction for physics-informed neural network design.

Abstract: Motion blur, caused by relative movement between camera and scene during exposure, significantly degrades image quality and impairs downstream computer vision tasks such as object detection, tracking, and recognition in dynamic environments. While deep learning-based motion deblurring methods have achieved remarkable progress, existing approaches face fundamental challenges in capturing the long-range spatial dependencies inherent in motion blur patterns. Traditional convolutional methods rely on limited receptive fields and require extremely deep networks to model global spatial relationships. These limitations motivate the need for alternative approaches that incorporate physical priors to guide feature evolution during restoration. In this paper, we propose a progressive training framework that integrates physics-informed PDE dynamics into state-of-the-art restoration architectures. By leveraging advection-diffusion equations to model feature evolution, our approach naturally captures the directional flow characteristics of motion blur while enabling principled global spatial modeling. Our PDE-enhanced deblurring models achieve superior restoration quality with minimal overhead, adding only approximately 1\% to inference GMACs while providing consistent improvements in perceptual quality across multiple state-of-the-art architectures. Comprehensive experiments on standard motion deblurring benchmarks demonstrate that our physics-informed approach improves PSNR and SSIM significantly across four diverse architectures, including FFTformer, NAFNet, Restormer, and Stripformer. These results validate that incorporating mathematical physics principles through PDE-based global layers can enhance deep learning-based image restoration, establishing a promising direction for physics-informed neural network design in computer vision applications.

Motivation: Gait recognition provides non-intrusive biometric identification, but generative models' potential remains underexplored compared to discriminative models. The paper aims to leverage both approaches for robust gait feature extraction.

Method: Proposes CoD² framework with Multi-level Conditional Control: high-level identity-aware semantic conditions from discriminative extractor guide identity-consistent generation, while low-level visual details (appearance, motion) enhance consistency. Generated sequences improve discriminative extractor's learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on SUSTech1K, CCPG, GREW, and Gait3D datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. The method can be seamlessly integrated with existing discriminative methods, yielding consistent improvements.

Conclusion: CoD² effectively combines generative and discriminative modeling for gait recognition, achieving superior performance through synergistic multi-level conditional control and mutual enhancement between generation and discrimination processes.

Abstract: Gait recognition offers a non-intrusive biometric solution by identifying individuals through their walking patterns. Although discriminative models have achieved notable success in this domain, the full potential of generative models remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{CoD$^2$}, a novel framework that combines the data distribution modeling capabilities of diffusion models with the semantic representation learning strengths of discriminative models to extract robust gait features. We propose a Multi-level Conditional Control strategy that incorporates both high-level identity-aware semantic conditions and low-level visual details. Specifically, the high-level condition, extracted by the discriminative extractor, guides the generation of identity-consistent gait sequences, whereas low-level visual details, such as appearance and motion, are preserved to enhance consistency. Furthermore, the generated sequences facilitate the discriminative extractor's learning, enabling it to capture more comprehensive high-level semantic features. Extensive experiments on four datasets (SUSTech1K, CCPG, GREW, and Gait3D) demonstrate that CoD$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance and can be seamlessly integrated with existing discriminative methods, yielding consistent improvements.

Conclusion: AdaDrive provides a flexible, context-aware framework that maximizes decision accuracy without compromising real-time performance in autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Effectively integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous driving requires a balance between leveraging high-level reasoning and maintaining real-time efficiency. Existing approaches either activate LLMs too frequently, causing excessive computational overhead, or use fixed schedules, failing to adapt to dynamic driving conditions. To address these challenges, we propose AdaDrive, an adaptively collaborative slow-fast framework that optimally determines when and how LLMs contribute to decision-making. (1) When to activate the LLM: AdaDrive employs a novel adaptive activation loss that dynamically determines LLM invocation based on a comparative learning mechanism, ensuring activation only in complex or critical scenarios. (2) How to integrate LLM assistance: Instead of rigid binary activation, AdaDrive introduces an adaptive fusion strategy that modulates a continuous, scaled LLM influence based on scene complexity and prediction confidence, ensuring seamless collaboration with conventional planners. Through these strategies, AdaDrive provides a flexible, context-aware framework that maximizes decision accuracy without compromising real-time performance. Extensive experiments on language-grounded autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate that AdaDrive state-of-the-art performance in terms of both driving accuracy and computational efficiency.

TL;DR: TMM-NN is a novel nearest-neighbor retrieval method that uses targeted perturbation via trigger patches to define neighborhoods based on sample responsiveness rather than geometric distance, outperforming traditional metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current nearest-neighbor retrieval relies on hand-tuning feature layers and distance metrics, which may not capture semantic relationships effectively.

Method: Uses a lightweight query-specific trigger patch added to query images, weakly backdooring the network to steer patched inputs toward a dummy class. Similar images require only slight shifts to be classified as dummy class.

Result: Outperforms traditional retrieval metrics under noise and across diverse tasks, with robustness analysis confirming effectiveness.

Conclusion: Trigger-based ranking provides more semantically meaningful neighborhoods than traditional geometric distance metrics.

Abstract: Nearest-neighbour retrieval is central to classification and explainable-AI pipelines, but current practice relies on hand-tuning feature layers and distance metrics. We propose Targeted Manifold Manipulation-Nearest Neighbour (TMM-NN), which reconceptualises retrieval by assessing how readily each sample can be nudged into a designated region of the feature manifold; neighbourhoods are defined by a sample's responsiveness to a targeted perturbation rather than absolute geometric distance. TMM-NN implements this through a lightweight, query-specific trigger patch. The patch is added to the query image, and the network is weakly ``backdoored'' so that any input with the patch is steered toward a dummy class. Images similar to the query need only a slight shift and are classified as the dummy class with high probability, while dissimilar ones are less affected. By ranking candidates by this confidence, TMM-NN retrieves the most semantically related neighbours. Robustness analysis and benchmark experiments confirm this trigger-based ranking outperforms traditional metrics under noise and across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: C³ effectively addresses LLM limitations in cross-modal retrieval by improving description completeness and consistency, demonstrating strong performance across cultural heritage and general datasets.

Abstract: Cross-modal retrieval is essential for interpreting cultural heritage data, but its effectiveness is often limited by incomplete or inconsistent textual descriptions, caused by historical data loss and the high cost of expert annotation. While large language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution by enriching textual descriptions, their outputs frequently suffer from hallucinations or miss visually grounded details. To address these challenges, we propose $C^3$, a data augmentation framework that enhances cross-modal retrieval performance by improving the completeness and consistency of LLM-generated descriptions. $C^3$ introduces a completeness evaluation module to assess semantic coverage using both visual cues and language-model outputs. Furthermore, to mitigate factual inconsistencies, we formulate a Markov Decision Process to supervise Chain-of-Thought reasoning, guiding consistency evaluation through adaptive query control. Experiments on the cultural heritage datasets CulTi and TimeTravel, as well as on general benchmarks MSCOCO and Flickr30K, demonstrate that $C^3$ achieves state-of-the-art performance in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings.

TL;DR: RelightMaster is a novel framework for precise video relighting that addresses limitations in text-to-video models by introducing Multi-plane Light Image (MPLI) visual prompts and leveraging a new RelightVideo dataset created with Unreal Engine.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video models lack fine-grained lighting control due to text's inability to describe lighting details precisely and insufficient pre-training on lighting-related prompts. High-quality relighting training data is also scarce in real-world settings.

Method: 1) Built RelightVideo dataset with identical dynamic content under varying lighting conditions using Unreal Engine; 2) Introduced Multi-plane Light Image (MPLI) to model lighting via depth-aligned planes representing 3D light source positions, intensities, and colors; 3) Designed Light Image Adapter to inject MPLI into pre-trained Video Diffusion Transformers without catastrophic forgetting.

Result: RelightMaster generates physically plausible lighting and shadows while preserving original scene content, demonstrating effective video relighting capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enables accurate and controllable video relighting through novel visual prompts and dataset construction, overcoming limitations of text-based lighting control in existing video generation models.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models enable high-quality video generation and editing, but precise relighting with consistent video contents, which is critical for shaping scene atmosphere and viewer attention, remains unexplored. Mainstream text-to-video (T2V) models lack fine-grained lighting control due to text's inherent limitation in describing lighting details and insufficient pre-training on lighting-related prompts. Additionally, constructing high-quality relighting training data is challenging, as real-world controllable lighting data is scarce. To address these issues, we propose RelightMaster, a novel framework for accurate and controllable video relighting. First, we build RelightVideo, the first dataset with identical dynamic content under varying precise lighting conditions based on the Unreal Engine. Then, we introduce Multi-plane Light Image (MPLI), a novel visual prompt inspired by Multi-Plane Image (MPI). MPLI models lighting via K depth-aligned planes, representing 3D light source positions, intensities, and colors while supporting multi-source scenarios and generalizing to unseen light setups. Third, we design a Light Image Adapter that seamlessly injects MPLI into pre-trained Video Diffusion Transformers (DiT): it compresses MPLI via a pre-trained Video VAE and injects latent light features into DiT blocks, leveraging the base model's generative prior without catastrophic forgetting. Experiments show that RelightMaster generates physically plausible lighting and shadows and preserves original scene content. Demos are available at https://wkbian.github.io/Projects/RelightMaster/.

*Zijie Wang,Weiming Zhang,Wei Zhang,Xiao Tan,Hongxing Liu,Yaowei Wang,Guanbin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LaneDiffusion introduces a novel generative approach using diffusion models for centerline graph learning in autonomous driving, outperforming existing methods on multiple metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deterministic methods for centerline graph learning lack spatial reasoning and struggle with occluded centerlines, while generative approaches remain underexplored in this domain.

Method: Uses diffusion models to generate lane centerline priors at BEV feature level, with Lane Prior Injection Module (LPIM) and Lane Prior Diffusion Module (LPDM) to construct diffusion targets and manage the process, then decodes vectorized centerlines from prior-injected BEV features.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing methods on nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets, achieving improvements of 4.2-6.8% on various point-level and segment-level metrics including GEO F1, TOPO F1, APLS, IoU, and mAP_cf.

Conclusion: Establishes state-of-the-art performance in centerline graph learning and offers new insights into generative models for this task.

Abstract: Centerline graphs, crucial for path planning in autonomous driving, are traditionally learned using deterministic methods. However, these methods often lack spatial reasoning and struggle with occluded or invisible centerlines. Generative approaches, despite their potential, remain underexplored in this domain. We introduce LaneDiffusion, a novel generative paradigm for centerline graph learning. LaneDiffusion innovatively employs diffusion models to generate lane centerline priors at the Bird's Eye View (BEV) feature level, instead of directly predicting vectorized centerlines. Our method integrates a Lane Prior Injection Module (LPIM) and a Lane Prior Diffusion Module (LPDM) to effectively construct diffusion targets and manage the diffusion process. Furthermore, vectorized centerlines and topologies are then decoded from these prior-injected BEV features. Extensive evaluations on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that LaneDiffusion significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving improvements of 4.2%, 4.6%, 4.7%, 6.4% and 1.8% on fine-grained point-level metrics (GEO F1, TOPO F1, JTOPO F1, APLS and SDA) and 2.3%, 6.4%, 6.8% and 2.1% on segment-level metrics (IoU, mAP_cf, DET_l and TOP_ll). These results establish state-of-the-art performance in centerline graph learning, offering new insights into generative models for this task.

*Zefeng He,Xiaoye Qu,Yafu Li,Siyuan Huang,Daizong Liu,Yu Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoSSR is a self-supervised reinforcement learning framework that uses intrinsic video information to generate verifiable training data, achieving over 5% average improvement across 17 video understanding benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video datasets are becoming insufficient for advancing MLLMs, and manual annotation is too expensive. The paper explores whether videos' intrinsic information can be used to self-generate high-quality training data.

Method: Proposes three self-supervised pretext tasks (Anomaly Grounding, Object Counting, Temporal Jigsaw), creates VideoSSR-30K dataset, and develops VideoSSR framework for video self-supervised reinforcement learning.

Result: VideoSSR consistently improves model performance across 17 benchmarks in four video domains (General Video QA, Long Video QA, Temporal Grounding, Complex Reasoning) with over 5% average improvement.

Conclusion: VideoSSR establishes a potent foundational framework for developing more advanced video understanding in MLLMs by leveraging self-supervised learning from intrinsic video information.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has substantially advanced the video understanding capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, the rapid progress of MLLMs is outpacing the complexity of existing video datasets, while the manual annotation of new, high-quality data remains prohibitively expensive. This work investigates a pivotal question: Can the rich, intrinsic information within videos be harnessed to self-generate high-quality, verifiable training data? To investigate this, we introduce three self-supervised pretext tasks: Anomaly Grounding, Object Counting, and Temporal Jigsaw. We construct the Video Intrinsic Understanding Benchmark (VIUBench) to validate their difficulty, revealing that current state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle significantly on these tasks. Building upon these pretext tasks, we develop the VideoSSR-30K dataset and propose VideoSSR, a novel video self-supervised reinforcement learning framework for RLVR. Extensive experiments across 17 benchmarks, spanning four major video domains (General Video QA, Long Video QA, Temporal Grounding, and Complex Reasoning), demonstrate that VideoSSR consistently enhances model performance, yielding an average improvement of over 5\%. These results establish VideoSSR as a potent foundational framework for developing more advanced video understanding in MLLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/lcqysl/VideoSSR.

*Ali Abbasian Ardakani,Afshin Mohammadi,Alisa Mohebbi,Anushya Vijayananthan,Sook Sam Leong,Lim Yi Ting,Mohd Kamil Bin Mohamad Fabell,U Rajendra Acharya,Sepideh Hatamikia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning models significantly outperform radiologists using O-RADS v2022 for ovarian lesion classification, with Vision Transformers achieving the best performance (AUC 0.941). Hybrid human-AI frameworks further enhance diagnostic accuracy, particularly for CNN models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address variability in human interpretation of ovarian lesions using O-RADS v2022 and evaluate whether deep learning models and hybrid human-AI approaches can improve diagnostic performance.

Method: Retrospective study of 512 adnexal mass images from 227 patients. Trained 16 DL models including CNNs and Vision Transformers, and developed hybrid models combining radiologist O-RADS scores with DL predictions.

Result: Radiologist-only O-RADS achieved AUC 0.683. CNN models ranged from AUC 0.620-0.908, while ViT16-384 achieved best performance (AUC 0.941, accuracy 87.4%). Hybrid frameworks significantly improved CNN models but not ViT models.

Conclusion: DL models outperform radiologist-only assessment, and hybrid human-AI integration yields highest diagnostic accuracy, showing potential to standardize ultrasound interpretation and improve lesion detection.

Abstract: Background: The 2022 update of the Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System (O-RADS) ultrasound classification refines risk stratification for adnexal lesions, yet human interpretation remains subject to variability and conservative thresholds. Concurrently, deep learning (DL) models have demonstrated promise in image-based ovarian lesion characterization. This study evaluates radiologist performance applying O-RADS v2022, compares it to leading convolutional neural network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models, and investigates the diagnostic gains achieved by hybrid human-AI frameworks. Methods: In this single-center, retrospective cohort study, a total of 512 adnexal mass images from 227 patients (110 with at least one malignant cyst) were included. Sixteen DL models, including DenseNets, EfficientNets, ResNets, VGGs, Xception, and ViTs, were trained and validated. A hybrid model integrating radiologist O-RADS scores with DL-predicted probabilities was also built for each scheme. Results: Radiologist-only O-RADS assessment achieved an AUC of 0.683 and an overall accuracy of 68.0%. CNN models yielded AUCs of 0.620 to 0.908 and accuracies of 59.2% to 86.4%, while ViT16-384 reached the best performance, with an AUC of 0.941 and an accuracy of 87.4%. Hybrid human-AI frameworks further significantly enhanced the performance of CNN models; however, the improvement for ViT models was not statistically significant (P-value >0.05). Conclusions: DL models markedly outperform radiologist-only O-RADS v2022 assessment, and the integration of expert scores with AI yields the highest diagnostic accuracy and discrimination. Hybrid human-AI paradigms hold substantial potential to standardize pelvic ultrasound interpretation, reduce false positives, and improve detection of high-risk lesions.

*Minsuk Jang,Hyeonseo Jeong,Minseok Son,Changick Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CINEMAE adapts text detection principles to images using Masked AutoEncoder reconstruction uncertainty to detect AI-generated images, achieving strong cross-generator generalization with 95%+ accuracy on unseen generators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image-based AIGC detectors struggle with overfitting to generator-specific artifacts, unlike text detectors that use distributional inconsistencies. The goal is to bring text detection's generalization capabilities to the visual domain.

Method: Uses Masked AutoEncoder trained to reconstruct masked patches conditioned on visible context. Computes conditional Negative Log-Likelihood to quantify local semantic anomalies, then aggregates patch-level statistics with global MAE features through learned fusion.

Result: Achieves over 95% accuracy on all eight unseen generators in the GenImage benchmark when trained only on Stable Diffusion v1.4, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art detectors.

Conclusion: Context-conditional reconstruction uncertainty provides a robust, transferable signal for AIGC detection, enabling strong cross-generator generalization without generator-specific overfitting.

Abstract: While context-based detectors have achieved strong generalization for AI-generated text by measuring distributional inconsistencies, image-based detectors still struggle with overfitting to generator-specific artifacts. We introduce CINEMAE, a novel paradigm for AIGC image detection that adapts the core principles of text detection methods to the visual domain. Our key insight is that Masked AutoEncoder (MAE), trained to reconstruct masked patches conditioned on visible context, naturally encodes semantic consistency expectations. We formalize this reconstruction process probabilistically, computing conditional Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL, p(masked | visible)) to quantify local semantic anomalies. By aggregating these patch-level statistics with global MAE features through learned fusion, CINEMAE achieves strong cross-generator generalization. Trained exclusively on Stable Diffusion v1.4, our method achieves over 95% accuracy on all eight unseen generators in the GenImage benchmark, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art detectors. This demonstrates that context-conditional reconstruction uncertainty provides a robust, transferable signal for AIGC detection.

TL;DR: TinyChemVL is an efficient 4B-parameter chemical vision-language model that addresses computational inefficiency and narrow task scope in chemical VLMs through visual token reduction and reaction-level tasks, outperforming existing models while using only 1/16th of visual tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs for chemical tasks are computationally inefficient due to processing entire chemical images with non-informative backgrounds, and have narrow scope focusing only on molecular-level tasks, limiting progress in chemical reasoning.

Method: Proposed TinyChemVL with visual token reduction to improve efficiency and reaction-level tasks to enhance reasoning capacity, along with ChemRxn-V benchmark for vision-based reaction recognition and prediction.

Result: TinyChemVL achieves superior performance on both molecular and reaction tasks with only 4B parameters, demonstrating faster inference and training speeds while outperforming ChemVLM using only 1/16th of visual tokens.

Conclusion: This work successfully builds efficient yet powerful VLMs for chemical domains through co-design of model architecture and task complexity, enabling better chemical reasoning while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: While Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in general visual understanding, their application in the chemical domain has been limited, with previous works predominantly focusing on text and thus overlooking critical visual information, such as molecular structures. Current approaches that directly adopt standard VLMs for chemical tasks suffer from two primary issues: (i) computational inefficiency of processing entire chemical images with non-informative backgrounds. (ii) a narrow scope on molecular-level tasks that restricts progress in chemical reasoning. In this work, we propose \textbf{TinyChemVL}, an efficient and powerful chemical VLM that leverages visual token reduction and reaction-level tasks to improve model efficiency and reasoning capacity. Also, we propose \textbf{ChemRxn-V}, a reaction-level benchmark for assessing vision-based reaction recognition and prediction tasks. Directly predicting reaction products from molecular images poses a non-trivial challenge, as it requires models to integrate both recognition and reasoning capacities. Our results demonstrate that with only 4B parameters, TinyChemVL achieves superior performance on both molecular and reaction tasks while demonstrating faster inference and training speeds compared to existing models. Notably, TinyChemVL outperforms ChemVLM while utilizing only 1/16th of the visual tokens. This work builds efficient yet powerful VLMs for chemical domains by co-designing model architecture and task complexity.

TL;DR: GazeVLM is a novel Vision-Language Model that unifies person detection, gaze target detection, and gaze object identification into a single framework using both visual and language prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research has modeled gaze cues but lacks a unified system for gaze understanding using both visual and language prompts, creating a need for an integrated approach.

Method: GazeVLM integrates visual (RGB and depth) and textual modalities, using a fusion of RGB images with HHA-encoded depth maps guided by text prompts. It allows selective execution of gaze understanding tasks.

Result: GazeVLM achieves state-of-the-art evaluation scores on GazeFollow and VideoAttentionTarget datasets, with ablation studies showing superior performance from RGB+HHA depth fusion.

Conclusion: GazeVLM successfully demonstrates the effectiveness of Vision-Language Models for unified gaze understanding tasks, introducing a new object-level gaze detection metric and showing significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Gaze understanding unifies the detection of people, their gaze targets, and objects of interest into a single framework, offering critical insight into visual attention and intent estimation. Although prior research has modelled gaze cues in visual scenes, a unified system is still needed for gaze understanding using both visual and language prompts. This paper introduces GazeVLM, a novel Vision-Language Model (VLM) for multi-task gaze understanding in images, addressing person detection, gaze target detection, and gaze object identification. While other transformer-based methods exist for gaze analysis, GazeVLM represents, to our knowledge, the first application of a VLM to these combined tasks, allowing for selective execution of each task. Through the integration of visual (RGB and depth) and textual modalities, our ablation study on visual input combinations revealed that a fusion of RGB images with HHA-encoded depth maps, guided by text prompts, yields superior performance. We also introduce an object-level gaze detection metric for gaze object identification ($AP_{ob}$). Through experiments, GazeVLM demonstrates significant improvements, notably achieving state-of-the-art evaluation scores on GazeFollow and VideoAttentionTarget datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RETSIMD is a multimodal misinformation detection method that leverages text segmentation and text-to-image generation to augment image data, using graph neural networks to fuse features from generated and original images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors observed that in multimodal misinformation detection, text modality is often more informative than images since text describes the complete event while images show only partial scenes. Their preliminary results confirmed images contribute less to detection accuracy.

Method: Split text into segments, use pre-trained text-to-image generator to create augmented images from segments, incorporate text-image and image-label mutual information objectives, post-train generator, and use graph neural network with heuristic image relationships for feature fusion.

Result: Extensive empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of RETSIMD in detecting multimodal misinformation.

Conclusion: The proposed RETSIMD method successfully addresses the limitation of image modality in misinformation detection by leveraging text segmentation and generation techniques, achieving improved detection performance.

Abstract: Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD) refers to the task of detecting social media posts involving misinformation, where the post often contains text and image modalities. However, by observing the MMD posts, we hold that the text modality may be much more informative than the image modality because the text generally describes the whole event/story of the current post but the image often presents partial scenes only. Our preliminary empirical results indicate that the image modality exactly contributes less to MMD. Upon this idea, we propose a new MMD method named RETSIMD. Specifically, we suppose that each text can be divided into several segments, and each text segment describes a partial scene that can be presented by an image. Accordingly, we split the text into a sequence of segments, and feed these segments into a pre-trained text-to-image generator to augment a sequence of images. We further incorporate two auxiliary objectives concerning text-image and image-label mutual information, and further post-train the generator over an auxiliary text-to-image generation benchmark dataset. Additionally, we propose a graph structure by defining three heuristic relationships between images, and use a graph neural network to generate the fused features. Extensive empirical results validate the effectiveness of RETSIMD.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current IVOD models suffer significant performance degradation when faced with incomplete modality data, especially when the dominant modality is missing, limiting their practical deployment in around-the-clock applications.

Method: Proposes Scarf Neck module with modality-agnostic deformable attention mechanism and pseudo modality dropout strategy during training to make detectors compatible with both single and double modalities.

Result: Scarf-DETR performs excellently in missing modality scenarios while achieving superior performance on standard IVOD modality-complete benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a robust solution for modality-incomplete IVOD that maintains high performance across both complete and incomplete modality scenarios.

Abstract: Infrared and visible object detection (IVOD) is essential for numerous around-the-clock applications. Despite notable advancements, current IVOD models exhibit notable performance declines when confronted with incomplete modality data, particularly if the dominant modality is missing. In this paper, we take a thorough investigation on modality incomplete IVOD problem from an architecture compatibility perspective. Specifically, we propose a plug-and-play Scarf Neck module for DETR variants, which introduces a modality-agnostic deformable attention mechanism to enable the IVOD detector to flexibly adapt to any single or double modalities during training and inference. When training Scarf-DETR, we design a pseudo modality dropout strategy to fully utilize the multi-modality information, making the detector compatible and robust to both working modes of single and double modalities. Moreover, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark for the modality-incomplete IVOD task aimed at thoroughly assessing situations where the absent modality is either dominant or secondary. Our proposed Scarf-DETR not only performs excellently in missing modality scenarios but also achieves superior performances on the standard IVOD modality complete benchmarks.

Motivation: Vision-Language Models struggle with complex visual narratives like comics due to stylized art, onomatopoeia, and multi-panel layouts, creating a significant performance gap compared to natural images.

Method: Created AI4VA-FG benchmark with dense annotations; evaluated state-of-the-art VLMs; investigated post-training strategies including SFT-S, SFT-R, RL, and proposed Region-Aware Reinforcement Learning (RARL) for dynamic region attention.

Result: Existing VLMs show substantial performance deficits on comic understanding tasks. RL and RARL applied to Qwen2.5-VL yielded significant gains in entity recognition and storyline ordering.

Conclusion: Comic understanding remains an unsolved challenge, but RL and RARL approaches show promise for improving VLM capabilities in this domain, paving the way for more accurate comic applications.

Abstract: Complex visual narratives, such as comics, present a significant challenge to Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Despite excelling on natural images, VLMs often struggle with stylized line art, onomatopoeia, and densely packed multi-panel layouts. To address this gap, we introduce AI4VA-FG, the first fine-grained and comprehensive benchmark for VLM-based comic understanding. It spans tasks from foundational recognition and detection to high-level character reasoning and narrative construction, supported by dense annotations for characters, poses, and depth. Beyond that, we evaluate state-of-the-art proprietary models, including GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5, and open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL, revealing substantial performance deficits across core tasks of our benchmarks and underscoring that comic understanding remains an unsolved challenge. To enhance VLMs' capabilities in this domain, we systematically investigate post-training strategies, including supervised fine-tuning on solutions (SFT-S), supervised fine-tuning on reasoning trajectories (SFT-R), and reinforcement learning (RL). Beyond that, inspired by the emerging "Thinking with Images" paradigm, we propose Region-Aware Reinforcement Learning (RARL) for VLMs, which trains models to dynamically attend to relevant regions through zoom-in operations. We observe that when applied to the Qwen2.5-VL model, RL and RARL yield significant gains in low-level entity recognition and high-level storyline ordering, paving the way for more accurate and efficient VLM applications in the comics domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multispectral object detection methods focus mainly on spatial-domain feature fusion, while frequency-domain features remain underexplored. There's a need to leverage both spatial and frequency domains for better cross-modal feature representation.

Method: SFFR method with two core modules: FCEKAN for selective frequency component exchange between RGB and IR images, and MSGKAN using multi-scale Gaussian basis functions to capture scale variations in spatial domain. Both leverage Kolmogorov-Arnold Network's spatial-frequency representation mechanisms.

Result: Extensive experiments on SeaDroneSee, DroneVehicle and DVTOD datasets demonstrate superior performance in UAV multispectral object perception. The modules effectively capture complementary frequency and spatial semantic features for better fusion.

Conclusion: The proposed FCEKAN and MSGKAN modules are complementary and significantly enhance model adaptability and robustness to scale variations in UAV multispectral object detection tasks, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Recent multispectral object detection methods have primarily focused on spatial-domain feature fusion based on CNNs or Transformers, while the potential of frequency-domain feature remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a novel Spatial and Frequency Feature Reconstruction method (SFFR) method, which leverages the spatial-frequency feature representation mechanisms of the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) to reconstruct complementary representations in both spatial and frequency domains prior to feature fusion. The core components of SFFR are the proposed Frequency Component Exchange KAN (FCEKAN) module and Multi-Scale Gaussian KAN (MSGKAN) module. The FCEKAN introduces an innovative selective frequency component exchange strategy that effectively enhances the complementarity and consistency of cross-modal features based on the frequency feature of RGB and IR images. The MSGKAN module demonstrates excellent nonlinear feature modeling capability in the spatial domain. By leveraging multi-scale Gaussian basis functions, it effectively captures the feature variations caused by scale changes at different UAV flight altitudes, significantly enhancing the model's adaptability and robustness to scale variations. It is experimentally validated that our proposed FCEKAN and MSGKAN modules are complementary and can effectively capture the frequency and spatial semantic features respectively for better feature fusion. Extensive experiments on the SeaDroneSee, DroneVehicle and DVTOD datasets demonstrate the superior performance and significant advantages of the proposed method in UAV multispectral object perception task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pure data-driven 3DGS struggles to capture physics-driven motion patterns in dynamic scenes, creating a need for physics-informed approaches.

Method: Uses static-dynamic decoupled 4D hash encoding, imposes Cauchy momentum residual as physics constraint, predicts particle velocity and stress via time-evolving material field, and supervises with camera-compensated optical flow matching.

Result: Significant improvements in physical consistency and monocular dynamic reconstruction quality on custom physics-driven dataset and standard synthetic/real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Physics-informed constraints combined with optical flow supervision enable more accurate and physically consistent dynamic scene reconstruction in 3D Gaussian Splatting.

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), an explicit scene representation technique, has shown significant promise for dynamic novel-view synthesis from monocular video input. However, purely data-driven 3DGS often struggles to capture the diverse physics-driven motion patterns in dynamic scenes. To fill this gap, we propose Physics-Informed Deformable Gaussian Splatting (PIDG), which treats each Gaussian particle as a Lagrangian material point with time-varying constitutive parameters and is supervised by 2D optical flow via motion projection. Specifically, we adopt static-dynamic decoupled 4D decomposed hash encoding to reconstruct geometry and motion efficiently. Subsequently, we impose the Cauchy momentum residual as a physics constraint, enabling independent prediction of each particle's velocity and constitutive stress via a time-evolving material field. Finally, we further supervise data fitting by matching Lagrangian particle flow to camera-compensated optical flow, which accelerates convergence and improves generalization. Experiments on a custom physics-driven dataset as well as on standard synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate significant gains in physical consistency and monocular dynamic reconstruction quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-model approaches for point cloud reconstruction suffer from inflexibility - they require conditioning signals during training, support only fixed input views, and need complete retraining for different measurements. Current methods using prior models with likelihood updates rely on heuristic fixed step sizes that lead to slow convergence and suboptimal quality.

Method: The method integrates a novel Forward Curvature-Matching (FCM) update with diffusion sampling, using forward automatic differentiation and finite-difference curvature estimates to dynamically determine optimal step sizes for precise likelihood optimization.

Result: Experiments on ShapeNet and CO3D datasets show superior reconstruction quality at matched or lower NFEs, achieving higher F-score and lower CD and EMD metrics compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The FCM method enables high-fidelity reconstruction from various input modalities through simple operator substitution without retraining, validating its efficiency and adaptability for practical applications in point cloud reconstruction.

Abstract: Reconstructing high-quality point clouds from images remains challenging in computer vision. Existing generative-model-based approaches, particularly diffusion-model approaches that directly learn the posterior, may suffer from inflexibility -- they require conditioning signals during training, support only a fixed number of input views, and need complete retraining for different measurements. Recent diffusion-based methods have attempted to address this by combining prior models with likelihood updates, but they rely on heuristic fixed step sizes for the likelihood update that lead to slow convergence and suboptimal reconstruction quality. We advance this line of approach by integrating our novel Forward Curvature-Matching (FCM) update method with diffusion sampling. Our method dynamically determines optimal step sizes using only forward automatic differentiation and finite-difference curvature estimates, enabling precise optimization of the likelihood update. This formulation enables high-fidelity reconstruction from both single-view and multi-view inputs, and supports various input modalities through simple operator substitution -- all without retraining. Experiments on ShapeNet and CO3D datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior reconstruction quality at matched or lower NFEs, yielding higher F-score and lower CD and EMD, validating its efficiency and adaptability for practical applications.

Method: Introduce a specialized tokenizer to convert puzzle pieces into discrete token sequences, reframing puzzle reassembly as a sequence-to-sequence prediction task using encoder-decoder transformers as 'blind' solvers.

Result: Models achieve state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks despite no visual input access, often outperforming vision-based methods.

Conclusion: Language models have surprising capability to solve problems beyond their native domain, and unconventional approaches can inspire promising directions for puzzle-solving research.

Abstract: Jigsaw puzzles are primarily visual objects, whose algorithmic solutions have traditionally been framed from a visual perspective. In this work, however, we explore a fundamentally different approach: solving square jigsaw puzzles using language models, without access to raw visual input. By introducing a specialized tokenizer that converts each puzzle piece into a discrete sequence of tokens, we reframe puzzle reassembly as a sequence-to-sequence prediction task. Treated as "blind" solvers, encoder-decoder transformers accurately reconstruct the original layout by reasoning over token sequences alone. Despite being deliberately restricted from accessing visual input, our models achieve state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks, often outperforming vision-based methods. These findings highlight the surprising capability of language models to solve problems beyond their native domain, and suggest that unconventional approaches can inspire promising directions for puzzle-solving research.

*Yifei Zhang,Jiashuo Zhang,Xiaofeng Yang,Liang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An explainable framework for joint cardiopulmonary risk assessment from low-dose chest CT scans that mimics clinical reasoning by connecting pulmonary findings to cardiovascular implications through medical knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches treat pulmonary and cardiovascular assessment as independent tasks, overlooking their physiological interplay and shared biomarkers in LDCT scans.

Method: Three-component framework: pulmonary perception module for lung abnormalities, knowledge-guided reasoning module for cardiovascular implications, and cardiac representation module for structural biomarkers, fused for holistic prediction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance for CVD screening and mortality prediction on NLST cohort, outperforming single-disease and purely image-based baselines.

Conclusion: Establishes a unified and explainable paradigm for cardiovascular analysis from LDCT that bridges image-based prediction with mechanism-based medical interpretation.

Abstract: Low-dose chest computed tomography (LDCT) inherently captures both pulmonary and cardiac structures, offering a unique opportunity for joint assessment of lung and cardiovascular health. However, most existing approaches treat these domains as independent tasks, overlooking their physiological interplay and shared imaging biomarkers. We propose an Explainable Cross-Disease Reasoning Framework that enables interpretable cardiopulmonary risk assessment from a single LDCT scan. The framework introduces an agentic reasoning process that emulates clinical diagnostic thinking-first perceiving pulmonary findings, then reasoning through established medical knowledge, and finally deriving a cardiovascular judgment with explanatory rationale. It integrates three synergistic components: a pulmonary perception module that summarizes lung abnormalities, a knowledge-guided reasoning module that infers their cardiovascular implications, and a cardiac representation module that encodes structural biomarkers. Their outputs are fused to produce a holistic cardiovascular risk prediction that is both accurate and physiologically grounded. Experiments on the NLST cohort demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for CVD screening and mortality prediction, outperforming single-disease and purely image-based baselines. Beyond quantitative gains, the framework provides human-verifiable reasoning that aligns with cardiological understanding, revealing coherent links between pulmonary abnormalities and cardiac stress mechanisms. Overall, this work establishes a unified and explainable paradigm for cardiovascular analysis from LDCT, bridging the gap between image-based prediction and mechanism-based medical interpretation.

*Depanshu Sani,Mehar Khurana,Saket Anand*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel active learning framework for animal re-identification that uses complementary clustering to identify ambiguous regions in embedding space, requiring only 0.033% of annotations to outperform existing methods by significant margins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Animal Re-ID is important for biodiversity monitoring but faces challenges including subtle distinguishing patterns, handling new species, and open-set nature. Existing foundation models underperform in zero-shot settings, while unsupervised and active learning methods are insufficient, creating a need for more efficient annotation approaches.

Method: Proposes an AL Re-ID framework that leverages complementary clustering methods to identify structurally ambiguous regions in embedding space for mining informative and representative sample pairs. Uses oracle feedback in the form of must-link/cannot-link constraints with a constrained clustering refinement algorithm.

Result: Achieves average improvements of 10.49%, 11.19% and 3.99% (mAP) on 13 wildlife datasets over foundational, USL and AL methods respectively, using only 0.033% of all annotations. Also shows 11.09%, 8.2% and 2.06% improvements for unknown individuals in open-world settings.

Conclusion: The proposed active learning framework effectively addresses the annotation bottleneck in animal Re-ID by strategically selecting informative samples, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal annotation effort while handling the challenges of open-world scenarios and unknown individuals.

Abstract: Animal Re-ID has recently gained substantial attention in the AI research community due to its high impact on biodiversity monitoring and unique research challenges arising from environmental factors. The subtle distinguishing patterns, handling new species and the inherent open-set nature make the problem even harder. To address these complexities, foundation models trained on labeled, large-scale and multi-species animal Re-ID datasets have recently been introduced to enable zero-shot Re-ID. However, our benchmarking reveals significant gaps in their zero-shot Re-ID performance for both known and unknown species. While this highlights the need for collecting labeled data in new domains, exhaustive annotation for Re-ID is laborious and requires domain expertise. Our analyses show that existing unsupervised (USL) and AL Re-ID methods underperform for animal Re-ID. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel AL Re-ID framework that leverages complementary clustering methods to uncover and target structurally ambiguous regions in the embedding space for mining pairs of samples that are both informative and broadly representative. Oracle feedback on these pairs, in the form of must-link and cannot-link constraints, facilitates a simple annotation interface, which naturally integrates with existing USL methods through our proposed constrained clustering refinement algorithm. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that, by utilizing only 0.033% of all annotations, our approach consistently outperforms existing foundational, USL and AL baselines. Specifically, we report an average improvement of 10.49%, 11.19% and 3.99% (mAP) on 13 wildlife datasets over foundational, USL and AL methods, respectively, while attaining state-of-the-art performance on each dataset. Furthermore, we also show an improvement of 11.09%, 8.2% and 2.06% for unknown individuals in an open-world setting.

TL;DR: MODS framework improves multimodal sentiment analysis by dynamically selecting primary modalities and reducing redundancy in acoustic/visual data using graph-based compression and cross-attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MSA methods use fixed primary modality strategies that fail to adapt to dynamic variations in modality importance across samples, and non-language modalities suffer from sequential redundancy and noise.

Method: Proposes MODS framework with: 1) Graph-based Dynamic Sequence Compressor (GDC) using capsule networks and graph convolution to reduce redundancy, 2) sample-adaptive Primary Modality Selector (MSelector) for dynamic dominance determination, 3) Primary-modality-Centric Cross-Attention (PCCA) module to enhance dominant modalities and cross-modal interaction.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show MODS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance by effectively balancing modality contributions and eliminating redundant noise.

Conclusion: The proposed MODS framework successfully addresses modality imbalance and redundancy issues in MSA through dynamic primary modality selection and optimized cross-modal interaction, demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing approaches.

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) aims to predict sentiment from language, acoustic, and visual data in videos. However, imbalanced unimodal performance often leads to suboptimal fused representations. Existing approaches typically adopt fixed primary modality strategies to maximize dominant modality advantages, yet fail to adapt to dynamic variations in modality importance across different samples. Moreover, non-language modalities suffer from sequential redundancy and noise, degrading model performance when they serve as primary inputs. To address these issues, this paper proposes a modality optimization and dynamic primary modality selection framework (MODS). First, a Graph-based Dynamic Sequence Compressor (GDC) is constructed, which employs capsule networks and graph convolution to reduce sequential redundancy in acoustic/visual modalities. Then, we develop a sample-adaptive Primary Modality Selector (MSelector) for dynamic dominance determination. Finally, a Primary-modality-Centric Cross-Attention (PCCA) module is designed to enhance dominant modalities while facilitating cross-modal interaction. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that MODS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance by effectively balancing modality contributions and eliminating redundant noise.

Method: Proposes Sim4Seg framework with Region-Aware Vision-Language Similarity to Mask (RVLS2M) module and test-time scaling strategy for MDS tasks.

Result: Experimental results show the method outperforms baselines in both segmentation and diagnosis performance.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully integrates medical segmentation with diagnostic reasoning, providing explainable diagnoses alongside segmentation results.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in pixel-level medical image analysis, existing medical image segmentation models rarely explore medical segmentation and diagnosis tasks jointly. However, it is crucial for patients that models can provide explainable diagnoses along with medical segmentation results. In this paper, we introduce a medical vision-language task named Medical Diagnosis Segmentation (MDS), which aims to understand clinical queries for medical images and generate the corresponding segmentation masks as well as diagnostic results. To facilitate this task, we first present the Multimodal Multi-disease Medical Diagnosis Segmentation (M3DS) dataset, containing diverse multimodal multi-disease medical images paired with their corresponding segmentation masks and diagnosis chain-of-thought, created via an automated diagnosis chain-of-thought generation pipeline. Moreover, we propose Sim4Seg, a novel framework that improves the performance of diagnosis segmentation by taking advantage of the Region-Aware Vision-Language Similarity to Mask (RVLS2M) module. To improve overall performance, we investigate a test-time scaling strategy for MDS tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baselines in both segmentation and diagnosis.

TL;DR: The paper explores self-supervised and transfer learning to reduce dependency on large annotated datasets for individual tree analysis from 3D point clouds, achieving significant improvements in instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and tree classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of labor-intensive 3D point cloud annotation for individual tree analysis in forestry, biodiversity conservation, and carbon mapping by reducing dependence on large annotated datasets.

Method: Combined self-supervised learning with domain adaptation for instance segmentation, used self-supervised learning for semantic segmentation, and employed hierarchical transfer learning for tree species classification.

Result: Achieved AP50 +16.98% for instance segmentation, mIoU +1.79% for semantic segmentation, and Jaccard +6.07% for tree species classification. Pretrained models reduced energy consumption by ~21%.

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework with self-supervised and transfer learning enables efficient extraction of individual tree information from laser scanning point clouds, supporting operational forestry, biodiversity, and carbon mapping applications.

Abstract: Detailed structural and species information on individual tree level is increasingly important to support precision forestry, biodiversity conservation, and provide reference data for biomass and carbon mapping. Point clouds from airborne and ground-based laser scanning are currently the most suitable data source to rapidly derive such information at scale. Recent advancements in deep learning improved segmenting and classifying individual trees and identifying semantic tree components. However, deep learning models typically require large amounts of annotated training data which limits further improvement. Producing dense, high-quality annotations for 3D point clouds, especially in complex forests, is labor-intensive and challenging to scale. We explore strategies to reduce dependence on large annotated datasets using self-supervised and transfer learning architectures. Our objective is to improve performance across three tasks: instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and tree classification using realistic and operational training sets. Our findings indicate that combining self-supervised learning with domain adaptation significantly enhances instance segmentation compared to training from scratch (AP50 +16.98%), self-supervised learning suffices for semantic segmentation (mIoU +1.79%), and hierarchical transfer learning enables accurate classification of unseen species (Jaccard +6.07%). To simplify use and encourage uptake, we integrated the tasks into a unified framework, streamlining the process from raw point clouds to tree delineation, structural analysis, and species classification. Pretrained models reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions by ~21%. This open-source contribution aims to accelerate operational extraction of individual tree information from laser scanning point clouds to support forestry, biodiversity, and carbon mapping.

Abstract: As digital twins become central to the transformation of modern cities, accurate and structured 3D building models emerge as a key enabler of high-fidelity, updatable urban representations. These models underpin diverse applications including energy modeling, urban planning, autonomous navigation, and real-time reasoning.

It encompasses buildings from geographically and architecturally diverse regions -- including North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania -- offering a globally representative dataset for urban-scale foundation modeling and analysis. Specifically, BuildingWorld provides about five million LOD2 building models collected from diverse sources, accompanied by real and simulated airborne LiDAR point clouds. This enables comprehensive research on 3D building reconstruction, detection and segmentation. Cyber City, a virtual city model, is introduced to enable the generation of unlimited training data with customized and structurally diverse point cloud distributions. Furthermore, we provide standardized evaluation metrics tailored for building reconstruction, aiming to facilitate the training, evaluation, and comparison of large-scale vision models and foundation models in structured 3D urban environments.

Conclusion: This work successfully applies Mamba-based architecture to mirror detection for the first time, providing an effective and scalable solution that addresses key limitations of previous methods while achieving superior performance across different datasets.

Abstract: Video mirror detection has received significant research attention, yet existing methods suffer from limited performance and robustness. These approaches often over-rely on single, unreliable dynamic features, and are typically built on CNNs with limited receptive fields or Transformers with quadratic computational complexity. To address these limitations, we propose a new effective and scalable video mirror detection method, called MirrorMamba. Our approach leverages multiple cues to adapt to diverse conditions, incorporating perceived depth, correspondence and optical. We also introduce an innovative Mamba-based Multidirection Correspondence Extractor, which benefits from the global receptive field and linear complexity of the emerging Mamba spatial state model to effectively capture correspondence properties. Additionally, we design a Mamba-based layer-wise boundary enforcement decoder to resolve the unclear boundary caused by the blurred depth map. Notably, this work marks the first successful application of the Mamba-based architecture in the field of mirror detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches for video mirror detection on the benchmark datasets. Furthermore, on the most challenging and representative image-based mirror detection dataset, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, proving its robustness and generalizability.

TL;DR: The paper proposes difficulty-aware sampling strategies (PISM and CMAB) for multimodal reasoning, showing that GRPO with strategic data sampling outperforms traditional SFT+GRPO pipelines without needing supervised fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing post-training paradigms for multimodal reasoning neglect quantifiable difficulty metrics and fail to jointly optimize perception and reasoning capabilities, creating a gap in effective sample screening and optimization.

Method: Proposed Progressive Image Semantic Masking (PISM) to quantify sample hardness through systematic image degradation, and Cross-Modality Attention Balance (CMAB) to assess cross-modal interaction complexity. Designed hierarchical training framework with GRPO-only and SFT+GRPO hybrid paradigms.

Result: Experiments across six benchmark datasets show consistent superiority of GRPO applied to difficulty-stratified samples compared to conventional SFT+GRPO pipelines, improving model accuracy without supervised fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Strategic data sampling through difficulty-aware metrics can eliminate the need for supervised fine-tuning while enhancing multimodal reasoning performance, demonstrating the importance of targeted sample selection in post-training optimization.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have spurred significant progress in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Building on the success of Deepseek-R1, researchers extended multimodal reasoning to post-training paradigms based on reinforcement learning (RL), focusing predominantly on mathematical datasets. However, existing post-training paradigms tend to neglect two critical aspects: (1) The lack of quantifiable difficulty metrics capable of strategically screening samples for post-training optimization. (2) Suboptimal post-training paradigms that fail to jointly optimize perception and reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we propose two novel difficulty-aware sampling strategies: Progressive Image Semantic Masking (PISM) quantifies sample hardness through systematic image degradation, while Cross-Modality Attention Balance (CMAB) assesses cross-modal interaction complexity via attention distribution analysis. Leveraging these metrics, we design a hierarchical training framework that incorporates both GRPO-only and SFT+GRPO hybrid training paradigms, and evaluate them across six benchmark datasets. Experiments demonstrate consistent superiority of GRPO applied to difficulty-stratified samples compared to conventional SFT+GRPO pipelines, indicating that strategic data sampling can obviate the need for supervised fine-tuning while improving model accuracy.

Abstract: Perceiving and producing aesthetic judgments is a fundamental yet underexplored capability for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing benchmarks for image aesthetic assessment (IAA) are narrow in perception scope or lack the diversity needed to evaluate systematic aesthetic production. To address this gap, we introduce AesTest, a comprehensive benchmark for multimodal aesthetic perception and production, distinguished by the following features: 1) It consists of curated multiple-choice questions spanning ten tasks, covering perception, appreciation, creation, and photography. These tasks are grounded in psychological theories of generative learning. 2) It integrates data from diverse sources, including professional editing workflows, photographic composition tutorials, and crowdsourced preferences. It ensures coverage of both expert-level principles and real-world variation. 3) It supports various aesthetic query types, such as attribute-based analysis, emotional resonance, compositional choice, and stylistic reasoning. We evaluate both instruction-tuned IAA MLLMs and general MLLMs on AesTest, revealing significant challenges in building aesthetic intelligence. We will publicly release AesTest to support future research in this area.

TL;DR: V-Shuffle is a zero-shot style transfer method that uses multiple style images to balance content preservation and style fidelity by shuffling value features in diffusion model attention layers and applying hybrid style regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attention-based style transfer methods suffer from content leakage, where undesired semantic content from style images appears in stylized outputs.

Method: V-Shuffle disrupts semantic content by shuffling value features in self-attention layers of diffusion models while preserving low-level style representations, complemented by Hybrid Style Regularization for high-level style textures.

Result: V-Shuffle achieves excellent performance with multiple style images and outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods when using a single style image.

Conclusion: V-Shuffle effectively addresses content leakage in style transfer through value feature shuffling and hybrid regularization, achieving superior performance in both multi-style and single-style scenarios.

Abstract: Attention injection-based style transfer has achieved remarkable progress in recent years. However, existing methods often suffer from content leakage, where the undesired semantic content of the style image mistakenly appears in the stylized output. In this paper, we propose V-Shuffle, a zero-shot style transfer method that leverages multiple style images from the same style domain to effectively navigate the trade-off between content preservation and style fidelity. V-Shuffle implicitly disrupts the semantic content of the style images by shuffling the value features within the self-attention layers of the diffusion model, thereby preserving low-level style representations. We further introduce a Hybrid Style Regularization that complements these low-level representations with high-level style textures to enhance style fidelity. Empirical results demonstrate that V-Shuffle achieves excellent performance when utilizing multiple style images. Moreover, when applied to a single style image, V-Shuffle outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TiS-TSL is a time-switchable teacher-student learning framework for video stereo matching in minimally invasive surgery that addresses temporal inconsistency in disparity predictions by using a unified model with three prediction modes and a two-stage learning strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stereo matching in MIS requires dense disparity supervision but is limited by anatomical constraints that only allow sparse image-level labels. Existing teacher-student methods lack temporal consistency, causing unstable predictions and flickering artifacts across video frames.

Method: Proposes TiS-TSL with a unified model operating in Image-Prediction, Forward Video-Prediction, and Backward Video-Prediction modes. Uses two-stage learning: Image-to-Video transfers sparse knowledge to temporal modeling, and Video-to-Video refines predictions using bidirectional spatio-temporal consistency.

Result: Experimental results on two public datasets show TiS-TSL outperforms image-based state-of-the-art methods, improving TEPE by at least 2.11% and EPE by at least 4.54%.

Conclusion: TiS-TSL effectively addresses temporal inconsistency in surgical stereo matching through flexible temporal modeling and bidirectional consistency checking, providing more stable and reliable disparity predictions across video frames.

Abstract: Stereo matching in minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is essential for next-generation navigation and augmented reality. Yet, dense disparity supervision is nearly impossible due to anatomical constraints, typically limiting annotations to only a few image-level labels acquired before the endoscope enters deep body cavities. Teacher-Student Learning (TSL) offers a promising solution by leveraging a teacher trained on sparse labels to generate pseudo labels and associated confidence maps from abundant unlabeled surgical videos. However, existing TSL methods are confined to image-level supervision, providing only spatial confidence and lacking temporal consistency estimation. This absence of spatio-temporal reliability results in unstable disparity predictions and severe flickering artifacts across video frames. To overcome these challenges, we propose TiS-TSL, a novel time-switchable teacher-student learning framework for video stereo matching under minimal supervision. At its core is a unified model that operates in three distinct modes: Image-Prediction (IP), Forward Video-Prediction (FVP), and Backward Video-Prediction (BVP), enabling flexible temporal modeling within a single architecture. Enabled by this unified model, TiS-TSL adopts a two-stage learning strategy. The Image-to-Video (I2V) stage transfers sparse image-level knowledge to initialize temporal modeling. The subsequent Video-to-Video (V2V) stage refines temporal disparity predictions by comparing forward and backward predictions to calculate bidirectional spatio-temporal consistency. This consistency identifies unreliable regions across frames, filters noisy video-level pseudo labels, and enforces temporal coherence. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that TiS-TSL exceeds other image-based state-of-the-arts by improving TEPE and EPE by at least 2.11% and 4.54%, respectively..

Conclusion: The InfoAffect dataset successfully addresses the data scarcity problem for exploring affective dimensions in infographics.

Abstract: Infographics are widely used to convey complex information, yet their affective dimensions remain underexplored due to the scarcity of data resources. We introduce a 3.5k-sample affect-annotated InfoAffect dataset, which combines textual content with real-world infographics. We first collect the raw data from six domains and aligned them via preprocessing, the accompanied-text-priority method, and three strategies to guarantee the quality and compliance. After that we construct an affect table and use it to constrain annotation. Five state-of-the-art multimodal large language models (MLLMs) then analyze both modalities, and their outputs are fused with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) algorithm to yield robust affects and confidences. We conducted a user study with two experiments to validate usability and assess InfoAffect dataset using the Composite Affect Consistency Index (CACI), achieving an overall score of 0.986, which indicates high accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeuroBridge is a self-supervised framework that improves visual neural decoding by using Cognitive Prior Augmentation and Shared Semantic Projector to better align EEG signals with visual content, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual neural decoding methods are limited by scarce stimulus-brain response data and semantic mismatches between neural representations and visual content. The authors aim to overcome these limitations by drawing inspiration from biological perceptual variability and co-adaptive strategies.

Method: Proposes NeuroBridge with two key components: Cognitive Prior Augmentation (CPA) that applies asymmetric, modality-specific transformations to EEG signals and images to enhance semantic diversity, and Shared Semantic Projector (SSP) that establishes bidirectional alignment through co-adaptive strategy to map features into a shared semantic space.

Result: NeuroBridge outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both intra-subject and inter-subject settings. In intra-subject scenario, it achieves 12.3% improvement in top-1 accuracy (63.2%) and 10.2% improvement in top-5 accuracy (89.9%) on 200-way zero-shot retrieval task.

Conclusion: The proposed NeuroBridge framework demonstrates effectiveness, robustness, and scalability for neural visual decoding, providing a promising approach for cross-modality alignment between brain activity and visual stimuli.

Abstract: Visual neural decoding seeks to reconstruct or infer perceived visual stimuli from brain activity patterns, providing critical insights into human cognition and enabling transformative applications in brain-computer interfaces and artificial intelligence. Current approaches, however, remain constrained by the scarcity of high-quality stimulus-brain response pairs and the inherent semantic mismatch between neural representations and visual content. Inspired by perceptual variability and co-adaptive strategy of the biological systems, we propose a novel self-supervised architecture, named NeuroBridge, which integrates Cognitive Prior Augmentation (CPA) with Shared Semantic Projector (SSP) to promote effective cross-modality alignment. Specifically, CPA simulates perceptual variability by applying asymmetric, modality-specific transformations to both EEG signals and images, enhancing semantic diversity. Unlike previous approaches, SSP establishes a bidirectional alignment process through a co-adaptive strategy, which mutually aligns features from two modalities into a shared semantic space for effective cross-modal learning. NeuroBridge surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods under both intra-subject and inter-subject settings. In the intra-subject scenario, it achieves the improvements of 12.3% in top-1 accuracy and 10.2% in top-5 accuracy, reaching 63.2% and 89.9% respectively on a 200-way zero-shot retrieval task.

TL;DR: PlantTraitNet uses citizen science photos and deep learning to create more accurate global plant trait maps than existing methods, outperforming current products across four key traits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing plant trait maps are limited by costly field measurements with sparse geographic coverage, while citizen science provides over 50 million geotagged plant photos that can overcome these limitations.

Method: Multi-modal, multi-task uncertainty-aware deep learning framework that predicts plant height, leaf area, specific leaf area, and nitrogen content from citizen science photos using weak supervision, then aggregates predictions to create global maps.

Result: PlantTraitNet consistently outperforms existing global trait products across all evaluated traits when validated against independent vegetation survey data (sPlotOpen).

Conclusion: Citizen science imagery combined with computer vision and geospatial AI enables scalable and more accurate global trait mapping, offering a powerful new pathway for ecological research and Earth system modeling.

Abstract: Global plant maps of plant traits, such as leaf nitrogen or plant height, are essential for understanding ecosystem processes, including the carbon and energy cycles of the Earth system. However, existing trait maps remain limited by the high cost and sparse geographic coverage of field-based measurements. Citizen science initiatives offer a largely untapped resource to overcome these limitations, with over 50 million geotagged plant photographs worldwide capturing valuable visual information on plant morphology and physiology. In this study, we introduce PlantTraitNet, a multi-modal, multi-task uncertainty-aware deep learning framework that predictsfour key plant traits (plant height, leaf area, specific leaf area, and nitrogen content) from citizen science photos using weak supervision. By aggregating individual trait predictions across space, we generate global maps of trait distributions. We validate these maps against independent vegetation survey data (sPlotOpen) and benchmark them against leading global trait products. Our results show that PlantTraitNet consistently outperforms existing trait maps across all evaluated traits, demonstrating that citizen science imagery, when integrated with computer vision and geospatial AI, enables not only scalable but also more accurate global trait mapping. This approach offers a powerful new pathway for ecological research and Earth system modeling.

*Zhengyu Zou,Jingfeng Li,Hao Li,Xiaolei Hou,Jinwen Hu,Jingkun Chen,Lechao Cheng,Dingwen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VDNeRF is a vision-only method that recovers camera trajectories and learns spatiotemporal representations for dynamic urban scenes without needing camera pose data or expensive sensors, using separate static and dynamic NeRF models with 3D scene flow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NeRF methods struggle with autonomous driving and robotic perception due to difficulties in capturing accurate camera poses and handling large-scale dynamic environments.

Method: Uses two separate NeRF models: static NeRF for camera pose optimization and background, and dynamic NeRF with 3D scene flow for moving objects. Includes training framework to resolve camera-object motion ambiguity.

Result: Surpasses state-of-the-art NeRF-based pose-free methods in both camera pose estimation and dynamic novel view synthesis on urban driving datasets.

Conclusion: VDNeRF effectively addresses pose-free dynamic scene reconstruction challenges in urban environments through joint static-dynamic modeling and robust training framework.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) implicitly model continuous three-dimensional scenes using a set of images with known camera poses, enabling the rendering of photorealistic novel views. However, existing NeRF-based methods encounter challenges in applications such as autonomous driving and robotic perception, primarily due to the difficulty of capturing accurate camera poses and limitations in handling large-scale dynamic environments. To address these issues, we propose Vision-only Dynamic NeRF (VDNeRF), a method that accurately recovers camera trajectories and learns spatiotemporal representations for dynamic urban scenes without requiring additional camera pose information or expensive sensor data. VDNeRF employs two separate NeRF models to jointly reconstruct the scene. The static NeRF model optimizes camera poses and static background, while the dynamic NeRF model incorporates the 3D scene flow to ensure accurate and consistent reconstruction of dynamic objects. To address the ambiguity between camera motion and independent object motion, we design an effective and powerful training framework to achieve robust camera pose estimation and self-supervised decomposition of static and dynamic elements in a scene. Extensive evaluations on mainstream urban driving datasets demonstrate that VDNeRF surpasses state-of-the-art NeRF-based pose-free methods in both camera pose estimation and dynamic novel view synthesis.

*Dongsheng Hong,Chao Chen,Yanhui Chen,Shanshan Lin,Zhihao Chen,Xiangwen Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ALIGN is a novel explanation-guided learning framework that jointly trains a classifier and masker to produce high-quality task-relevant masks, improving both model performance and interpretability without relying on external annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current explanation-guided learning approaches rely on external annotations or heuristic-based segmentation for supervision, which are often noisy, imprecise, and difficult to scale. Low-quality supervision signals can actually degrade model performance rather than improve it.

Method: ALIGN jointly trains a classifier and a masker in an iterative manner. The masker learns to produce soft, task-relevant masks highlighting informative regions, while the classifier is optimized for both prediction accuracy and alignment between its saliency maps and the learned masks.

Result: ALIGN consistently outperforms six strong baselines on VLCS and Terra Incognita domain generalization benchmarks in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. It also yields superior explanation quality in terms of sufficiency and comprehensiveness.

Conclusion: ALIGN effectively improves both interpretability and generalizability by leveraging high-quality masks as guidance, demonstrating superiority across various settings and producing accurate and interpretable models.

Abstract: Explanation-guided learning (EGL) has shown promise in aligning model predictions with interpretable reasoning, particularly in computer vision tasks. However, most approaches rely on external annotations or heuristic-based segmentation to supervise model explanations, which can be noisy, imprecise and difficult to scale. In this work, we provide both empirical and theoretical evidence that low-quality supervision signals can degrade model performance rather than improve it. In response, we propose ALIGN, a novel framework that jointly trains a classifier and a masker in an iterative manner. The masker learns to produce soft, task-relevant masks that highlight informative regions, while the classifier is optimized for both prediction accuracy and alignment between its saliency maps and the learned masks. By leveraging high-quality masks as guidance, ALIGN improves both interpretability and generalizability, showing its superiority across various settings. Experiments on the two domain generalization benchmarks, VLCS and Terra Incognita, show that ALIGN consistently outperforms six strong baselines in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. Besides, ALIGN also yields superior explanation quality concerning sufficiency and comprehensiveness, highlighting its effectiveness in producing accurate and interpretable models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffusionUavLoc is a cross-view UAV localization framework that uses diffusion models and VAE for unified representation, achieving competitive performance in GNSS-denied environments without requiring text prompts or extensive annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of satellite-based localization in GNSS-denied environments and overcome the geometric/appearance domain gaps between UAV oblique views and satellite orthophotos, while avoiding complex networks and annotation dependencies.

Method: Uses training-free geometric rendering to synthesize pseudo-satellite images as structural prompts, then employs a text-free conditional diffusion model with VAE for unified representation that fuses multimodal structural cues for viewpoint-robust feature learning.

Result: Achieves competitive cross-view localization performance on University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets, particularly excelling at satellite-to-drone localization in University-1652.

Conclusion: The proposed DiffusionUavLoc framework provides an effective solution for UAV localization in GNSS-denied environments by leveraging diffusion models and structural prompts, demonstrating strong generalization without text dependencies or extensive annotations.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of the low-altitude economy, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become key platforms for measurement and tracking in intelligent patrol systems. However, in GNSS-denied environments, localization schemes that rely solely on satellite signals are prone to failure. Cross-view image retrieval-based localization is a promising alternative, yet substantial geometric and appearance domain gaps exist between oblique UAV views and nadir satellite orthophotos. Moreover, conventional approaches often depend on complex network architectures, text prompts, or large amounts of annotation, which hinders generalization. To address these issues, we propose DiffusionUavLoc, a cross-view localization framework that is image-prompted, text-free, diffusion-centric, and employs a VAE for unified representation. We first use training-free geometric rendering to synthesize pseudo-satellite images from UAV imagery as structural prompts. We then design a text-free conditional diffusion model that fuses multimodal structural cues to learn features robust to viewpoint changes. At inference, descriptors are computed at a fixed time step t and compared using cosine similarity. On University-1652 and SUES-200, the method performs competitively for cross-view localization, especially for satellite-to-drone in University-1652.Our data and code will be published at the following URL: https://github.com/liutao23/DiffusionUavLoc.git.

*Yulin Chen,Zeyuan Wang,Tianyuan Yu,Yingmei Wei,Liang Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoCLIP is a feature-space misalignment framework that fools CLIP-based image quality metrics by optimizing images to achieve high CLIPscores while maintaining visual fidelity, even when images are visually unrecognizable or semantically incongruent with prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP-based metrics like CLIPscore are widely used for image quality assessment but are vulnerable due to their delicate multimodal alignment, making them susceptible to adversarial attacks.

Method: FoCLIP uses stochastic gradient descent with three components: feature alignment to reduce modality gaps, score distribution balance, and pixel-guard regularization to optimize multimodal output equilibrium between CLIPscore and image quality.

Result: Experiments show optimized images achieve significant CLIPscore improvement while preserving visual fidelity. Grayscale conversion was found to degrade fooling images' features, leading to a color channel sensitivity-driven detection method with 91% accuracy.

Conclusion: This work establishes a practical pathway for feature misalignment in CLIP-based systems and provides an effective defense mechanism against such attacks.

Abstract: The well-aligned attribute of CLIP-based models enables its effective application like CLIPscore as a widely adopted image quality assessment metric. However, such a CLIP-based metric is vulnerable for its delicate multimodal alignment. In this work, we propose \textbf{FoCLIP}, a feature-space misalignment framework for fooling CLIP-based image quality metric. Based on the stochastic gradient descent technique, FoCLIP integrates three key components to construct fooling examples: feature alignment as the core module to reduce image-text modality gaps, the score distribution balance module and pixel-guard regularization, which collectively optimize multimodal output equilibrium between CLIPscore performance and image quality. Such a design can be engineered to maximize the CLIPscore predictions across diverse input prompts, despite exhibiting either visual unrecognizability or semantic incongruence with the corresponding adversarial prompts from human perceptual perspectives. Experiments on ten artistic masterpiece prompts and ImageNet subsets demonstrate that optimized images can achieve significant improvement in CLIPscore while preserving high visual fidelity. In addition, we found that grayscale conversion induces significant feature degradation in fooling images, exhibiting noticeable CLIPscore reduction while preserving statistical consistency with original images. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a color channel sensitivity-driven tampering detection mechanism that achieves 91% accuracy on standard benchmarks. In conclusion, this work establishes a practical pathway for feature misalignment in CLIP-based multimodal systems and the corresponding defense method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes UFC-MIL, an uncertainty-focused calibrated multiple instance learning method that mimics pathologists' examination behaviors using multi-resolution images, providing well-calibrated diagnostic predictions without requiring multiple iterative inferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multiple-resolution MIL approaches focus only on performance improvement but lack research on well-calibrated MIL that clinical experts can trust for reliable diagnostic results.

Method: UFC-MIL uses multiple-resolution images with a novel patch-wise loss that learns latent patterns and expresses uncertainty, attention-based architecture with neighbor patch aggregation, and calibrates aggregated predictions through patch-level uncertainty.

Result: UFC-MIL shows superior performance in model calibration while achieving classification accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods on challenging public datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed UFC-MIL successfully provides calibrated diagnostic predictions that mimic pathologists' examination behaviors, offering trustworthy AI-centric diagnostic aid for histopathological specimen examination.

Abstract: With the increasing demand for histopathological specimen examination and diagnostic reporting, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has received heightened research focus as a viable solution for AI-centric diagnostic aid. Recently, to improve its performance and make it work more like a pathologist, several MIL approaches based on the use of multiple-resolution images have been proposed, delivering often higher performance than those that use single-resolution images. Despite impressive recent developments of multiple-resolution MIL, previous approaches only focus on improving performance, thereby lacking research on well-calibrated MIL that clinical experts can rely on for trustworthy diagnostic results. In this study, we propose Uncertainty-Focused Calibrated MIL (UFC-MIL), which more closely mimics the pathologists' examination behaviors while providing calibrated diagnostic predictions, using multiple images with different resolutions. UFC-MIL includes a novel patch-wise loss that learns the latent patterns of instances and expresses their uncertainty for classification. Also, the attention-based architecture with a neighbor patch aggregation module collects features for the classifier. In addition, aggregated predictions are calibrated through patch-level uncertainty without requiring multiple iterative inferences, which is a key practical advantage. Against challenging public datasets, UFC-MIL shows superior performance in model calibration while achieving classification accuracy comparable to that of state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limited real-world annotated data for 3D semantic scene understanding and the synthetic-to-real domain gap in existing datasets, where synthetic scenes fail to capture real-world complexity and sensor noise.

Method: Introduce TrueCity benchmark with cm-accurate annotated real-world point clouds, semantic 3D city models, and annotated simulated point clouds representing the same city, using segmentation classes aligned with international 3D city modeling standards.

Result: Extensive experiments on common baselines quantify domain shift and highlight strategies for exploiting synthetic data to enhance real-world 3D scene understanding.

Conclusion: TrueCity will foster development of sim-to-real gap quantification and enable generalizable data-driven models for 3D semantic scene understanding.

Abstract: 3D semantic scene understanding remains a long-standing challenge in the 3D computer vision community. One of the key issues pertains to limited real-world annotated data to facilitate generalizable models. The common practice to tackle this issue is to simulate new data. Although synthetic datasets offer scalability and perfect labels, their designer-crafted scenes fail to capture real-world complexity and sensor noise, resulting in a synthetic-to-real domain gap. Moreover, no benchmark provides synchronized real and simulated point clouds for segmentation-oriented domain shift analysis. We introduce TrueCity, the first urban semantic segmentation benchmark with cm-accurate annotated real-world point clouds, semantic 3D city models, and annotated simulated point clouds representing the same city. TrueCity proposes segmentation classes aligned with international 3D city modeling standards, enabling consistent evaluation of synthetic-to-real gap. Our extensive experiments on common baselines quantify domain shift and highlight strategies for exploiting synthetic data to enhance real-world 3D scene understanding. We are convinced that the TrueCity dataset will foster further development of sim-to-real gap quantification and enable generalizable data-driven models.

*Seulgi Kim,Kiran Kokilepersaud,Mohit Prabhushankar,Ghassan AlRegib*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Rank-enhancing Token Fuser to address feature and modality collapse in multi-modal fusion using effective rank as a unifying measure, achieving state-of-the-art performance in action anticipation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-modal fusion methods suffer from feature collapse (dimensions lose discriminative power) and modality collapse (one modality dominates), hindering applications like human action anticipation that require fusing diverse sensor data.

Method: Uses effective rank to quantify both collapses; proposes Rank-enhancing Token Fuser that selectively blends less informative features with complementary ones; evaluates modality combinations that mutually increase effective rank; introduces R3D depth-informed fusion framework.

Result: Depth maintains representational balance when fused with RGB, avoiding modality collapse; method significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art by up to 3.74% on NTURGBD, UTKinect, and DARai datasets.

Conclusion: Effective rank serves as a unifying framework to address both feature and modality collapse; depth-RGB fusion achieves balanced representations; proposed approach enables more effective multi-modal fusion for action anticipation.

Abstract: Multi-modal fusion methods often suffer from two types of representation collapse: feature collapse where individual dimensions lose their discriminative power (as measured by eigenspectra), and modality collapse where one dominant modality overwhelms the other. Applications like human action anticipation that require fusing multifarious sensor data are hindered by both feature and modality collapse. However, existing methods attempt to counter feature collapse and modality collapse separately. This is because there is no unifying framework that efficiently addresses feature and modality collapse in conjunction. In this paper, we posit the utility of effective rank as an informative measure that can be utilized to quantify and counter both the representation collapses. We propose \textit{Rank-enhancing Token Fuser}, a theoretically grounded fusion framework that selectively blends less informative features from one modality with complementary features from another modality. We show that our method increases the effective rank of the fused representation. To address modality collapse, we evaluate modality combinations that mutually increase each others' effective rank. We show that depth maintains representational balance when fused with RGB, avoiding modality collapse. We validate our method on action anticipation, where we present \texttt{R3D}, a depth-informed fusion framework. Extensive experiments on NTURGBD, UTKinect, and DARai demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods by up to 3.74\%.

Result: The dataset enables various perception tasks, and the baseline method achieves strong performance in challenging conditions despite its simplicity.

Conclusion: High-quality data, modular pipelines, and principled evaluation can compete with complex approaches, supporting reproducibility in LiDAR-based lane detection.

Abstract: We present Pandar128, the largest public dataset for lane line detection using a 128-beam LiDAR. It contains over 52,000 camera frames and 34,000 LiDAR scans, captured in diverse real-world conditions in Germany. The dataset includes full sensor calibration (intrinsics, extrinsics) and synchronized odometry, supporting tasks such as projection, fusion, and temporal modeling.
  To complement the dataset, we also introduce SimpleLidarLane, a light-weight baseline method for lane line reconstruction that combines BEV segmentation, clustering, and polyline fitting. Despite its simplicity, our method achieves strong performance under challenging various conditions (e.g., rain, sparse returns), showing that modular pipelines paired with high-quality data and principled evaluation can compete with more complex approaches.
  Furthermore, to address the lack of standardized evaluation, we propose a novel polyline-based metric - Interpolation-Aware Matching F1 (IAM-F1) - that employs interpolation-aware lateral matching in BEV space.

TL;DR: EIDSeg is the first large-scale semantic segmentation dataset for post-earthquake social media imagery, enabling fine-grained damage assessment across five infrastructure classes with a practical annotation protocol that achieves 70%+ inter-annotator agreement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rapid post-earthquake damage assessment is crucial but existing methods rely on costly aerial images, expert labeling, and produce only binary damage maps. Social media ground-level images provide valuable data but lack large pixel-level annotated datasets.

Method: Created EIDSeg dataset with 3,266 images from nine major earthquakes (2008-2023), annotated across five damage classes using a three-phase cross-disciplinary annotation protocol with non-expert annotators. Benchmarked state-of-the-art segmentation models.

Result: Achieved over 70% inter-annotator agreement with the annotation protocol. Encoder-only Mask Transformer (EoMT) performed best with 80.8% mIoU on the dataset.

Conclusion: The work enables faster, finer-grained damage assessment by leveraging social networks' ground-level perspective through a scalable annotation approach and high-performing segmentation models.

Abstract: Rapid post-earthquake damage assessment is crucial for rescue and resource planning. Still, existing remote sensing methods depend on costly aerial images, expert labeling, and produce only binary damage maps for early-stage evaluation. Although ground-level images from social networks provide a valuable source to fill this gap, a large pixel-level annotated dataset for this task is still unavailable. We introduce EIDSeg, the first large-scale semantic segmentation dataset specifically for post-earthquake social media imagery. The dataset comprises 3,266 images from nine major earthquakes (2008-2023), annotated across five classes of infrastructure damage: Undamaged Building, Damaged Building, Destroyed Building, Undamaged Road, and Damaged Road. We propose a practical three-phase cross-disciplinary annotation protocol with labeling guidelines that enables consistent segmentation by non-expert annotators, achieving over 70% inter-annotator agreement. We benchmark several state-of-the-art segmentation models, identifying Encoder-only Mask Transformer (EoMT) as the top-performing method with a Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 80.8%. By unlocking social networks' rich ground-level perspective, our work paves the way for a faster, finer-grained damage assessment in the post-earthquake scenario.

*Jeng-Lin Li,Ming-Ching Chang,Wei-Chao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates bias in text-to-image models under semantic binding, where contextual associations between objects and attributes amplify bias. The authors introduce a bias adherence score and a training-free framework that achieves over 10% debiasing improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current bias research focuses narrowly on single-object prompts, neglecting how semantic binding between objects and attributes in prompts (e.g., 'an assistant wearing a pink hat') can amplify bias. Existing debiasing approaches fail to address these joint effects.

Method: The authors introduce a bias adherence score to quantify how object-attribute bindings activate bias, and develop a training-free context-bias control framework using token decoupling to debias semantic bindings.

Result: The framework achieves over 10% debiasing improvement in compositional generation tasks. Analysis reveals that reducing bias without disrupting essential semantic relationships presents a fundamental challenge.

Conclusion: Current debiasing approaches have critical limitations when applied to semantically bound contexts, requiring reassessment of prevailing bias mitigation strategies to address joint effects of semantic binding.

Abstract: Text-to-image generative models often exhibit bias related to sensitive attributes. However, current research tends to focus narrowly on single-object prompts with limited contextual diversity. In reality, each object or attribute within a prompt can contribute to bias. For example, the prompt "an assistant wearing a pink hat" may reflect female-inclined biases associated with a pink hat. The neglected joint effects of the semantic binding in the prompts cause significant failures in current debiasing approaches. This work initiates a preliminary investigation on how bias manifests under semantic binding, where contextual associations between objects and attributes influence generative outcomes. We demonstrate that the underlying bias distribution can be amplified based on these associations. Therefore, we introduce a bias adherence score that quantifies how specific object-attribute bindings activate bias. To delve deeper, we develop a training-free context-bias control framework to explore how token decoupling can facilitate the debiasing of semantic bindings. This framework achieves over 10% debiasing improvement in compositional generation tasks. Our analysis of bias scores across various attribute-object bindings and token decorrelation highlights a fundamental challenge: reducing bias without disrupting essential semantic relationships. These findings expose critical limitations in current debiasing approaches when applied to semantically bound contexts, underscoring the need to reassess prevailing bias mitigation strategies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Inpaint360GS is a 3D Gaussian Splatting-based framework for multi-object removal and high-fidelity inpainting in 360° scenes, addressing challenges of object identification, occlusion handling, and view consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 360° scene inpainting remains underexplored due to challenges in identifying target objects in 3D fields, handling severe occlusions in multi-object scenes, and maintaining consistent appearance across views.

Method: Proposes Inpaint360GS framework using 3DGS that distills 2D segmentation into 3D and leverages virtual camera views for contextual guidance to enable accurate object-level editing and consistent scene completion.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance in 360° inpainting, with the introduction of a new dataset for 360° inpainting that addresses lack of ground truth object-free scenes.

Conclusion: Inpaint360GS provides an effective solution for flexible 360° editing with multi-object removal and high-quality inpainting, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in single-object front-facing inpainting using NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), inpainting in complex 360° scenes remains largely underexplored. This is primarily due to three key challenges: (i) identifying target objects in the 3D field of 360° environments, (ii) dealing with severe occlusions in multi-object scenes, which makes it hard to define regions to inpaint, and (iii) maintaining consistent and high-quality appearance across views effectively. To tackle these challenges, we propose Inpaint360GS, a flexible 360° editing framework based on 3DGS that supports multi-object removal and high-fidelity inpainting in 3D space. By distilling 2D segmentation into 3D and leveraging virtual camera views for contextual guidance, our method enables accurate object-level editing and consistent scene completion. We further introduce a new dataset tailored for 360° inpainting, addressing the lack of ground truth object-free scenes. Experiments demonstrate that Inpaint360GS outperforms existing baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Project page: https://dfki-av.github.io/inpaint360gs/

*Sirui Wang,Jiang He,Natàlia Blasco Andreo,Xiao Xiang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GEWDiff is a novel diffusion model that achieves 4x super-resolution for hyperspectral images using wavelet-based compression and geometry-enhanced diffusion to overcome memory constraints and preserve geometric features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral images are memory-intensive for conventional diffusion models and lack geometric understanding. Existing models have non-intuitive convergence and suboptimal quality due to noise-level optimization.

Method: Uses wavelet-based encoder-decoder for efficient compression, geometry-enhanced diffusion process to preserve features, and multi-level loss function for stable convergence.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance in fidelity, spectral accuracy, visual realism, and clarity for 4x HSI super-resolution.

Conclusion: GEWDiff effectively addresses HSI generation challenges through wavelet compression and geometric enhancement, delivering superior super-resolution quality.

Abstract: Improving the quality of hyperspectral images (HSIs), such as through super-resolution, is a crucial research area. However, generative modeling for HSIs presents several challenges. Due to their high spectral dimensionality, HSIs are too memory-intensive for direct input into conventional diffusion models. Furthermore, general generative models lack an understanding of the topological and geometric structures of ground objects in remote sensing imagery. In addition, most diffusion models optimize loss functions at the noise level, leading to a non-intuitive convergence behavior and suboptimal generation quality for complex data. To address these challenges, we propose a Geometric Enhanced Wavelet-based Diffusion Model (GEWDiff), a novel framework for reconstructing hyperspectral images at 4-times super-resolution. A wavelet-based encoder-decoder is introduced that efficiently compresses HSIs into a latent space while preserving spectral-spatial information. To avoid distortion during generation, we incorporate a geometry-enhanced diffusion process that preserves the geometric features. Furthermore, a multi-level loss function was designed to guide the diffusion process, promoting stable convergence and improved reconstruction fidelity. Our model demonstrated state-of-the-art results across multiple dimensions, including fidelity, spectral accuracy, visual realism, and clarity.

### [139] [NOAH: Benchmarking Narrative Prior driven Hallucination and Omission in Video Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06475)
*Kyuho Lee,Euntae Kim,Jinwoo Choi,Buru Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NOAH is a benchmark for evaluating narrative prior-induced hallucinations and omissions in Video LLMs, using composite videos with inserted clips to systematically analyze how models prioritize storyline consistency over visual evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video LLMs often prioritize narrative coherence over visual grounding, leading to hallucinations (introducing non-existent events) and omissions (suppressing factual events). Current evaluation methods don't systematically assess these narrative prior-induced errors.

Method: Created NOAH benchmark with composite videos by inserting clips from other sources into target videos, varying semantic similarity and insertion positions. Includes captioning task with tailored metrics and three QA tasks (Existence, Temporal, Narrative) with 60K+ samples.

Result: Most Video LLMs exhibit narrative prior-driven hallucinations and omissions; error patterns vary by architecture and depend on event similarity/position; reliance on narrative priors intensifies with fewer frames, amplifying errors when event continuity is weak.

Conclusion: NOAH provides the first standardized evaluation for narrative prior-induced hallucination and omission in Video LLMs, establishing a foundation for developing more reliable and trustworthy video understanding models.

Abstract: Video large language models (Video LLMs) have recently achieved strong performance on tasks such as captioning, summarization, and question answering. Many models and training methods explicitly encourage continuity across events to enhance narrative coherence. While this improves fluency, it also introduces an inductive bias that prioritizes storyline consistency over strict grounding in visual evidence. We identify this bias, which we call narrative prior, as a key driver of two errors: hallucinations, where non-existent events are introduced or existing ones are misinterpreted, and omissions, where factual events are suppressed because they are misaligned with surrounding context. To systematically evaluate narrative prior-induced errors, we introduce NOAH, a large-scale benchmark that constructs composite videos by inserting clips from other sources into target videos. By varying semantic similarity and insertion position, our benchmark enables controlled and scalable analysis of narrative priors. We design one captioning task with tailored metrics and three QA tasks - Existence, Temporal, and Narrative - yielding more than 60K evaluation samples. Extensive experiments yield three key findings: (i) most Video LLMs exhibit hallucinations and omissions driven by narrative priors, (ii) the patterns of these errors vary across architectures and depend on event similarity and insertion position, and (iii) reliance on narrative priors intensifies under sampling with fewer frames, amplifying errors when event continuity is weak. We establish NOAH as the first standardized evaluation of narrative prior-induced hallucination and omission in Video LLMs, providing a foundation for developing more reliable and trustworthy models.

### [140] [Federated Learning for Video Violence Detection: Complementary Roles of Lightweight CNNs and Vision-Language Models for Energy-Efficient Use](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07171)
*Sébastien Thuau,Siba Haidar,Rachid Chelouah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper compares three federated learning strategies for violence detection: zero-shot VLM inference, LoRA-tuned LLaVA-NeXT-Video-7B, and personalized 3D CNN. The 3D CNN achieves better calibration at half the energy cost of federated LoRA, while hierarchical category grouping boosts VLM multiclass accuracy from 65.31% to 81%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning-based video surveillance needs privacy-preserving architectures with low computational and environmental overhead. Federated learning preserves privacy but deploying large vision-language models introduces major energy and sustainability challenges.

Method: Compared three federated violence detection strategies under realistic non-IID splits: zero-shot inference with pretrained VLMs, LoRA-based fine-tuning of LLaVA-NeXT-Video-7B, and personalized federated learning of a 65.8M-parameter 3D CNN. Used hierarchical category grouping based on semantic similarity and class exclusion.

Result: All methods exceed 90% accuracy in binary violence detection. 3D CNN achieves superior calibration (ROC AUC 92.59%) at roughly half the energy cost (240 Wh vs. 570 Wh) of federated LoRA. Hierarchical category grouping boosts VLM multiclass accuracy from 65.31% to 81% on UCF-Crime dataset.

Conclusion: Hybrid deployment strategies should default to efficient CNNs for routine inference and selectively engage VLMs for complex contextual reasoning. This is the first comparative simulation study of LoRA-tuned VLMs and personalized CNNs for federated violence detection with explicit energy and CO2e quantification.

Abstract: Deep learning-based video surveillance increasingly demands privacy-preserving architectures with low computational and environmental overhead. Federated learning preserves privacy but deploying large vision-language models (VLMs) introduces major energy and sustainability challenges. We compare three strategies for federated violence detection under realistic non-IID splits on the RWF-2000 and RLVS datasets: zero-shot inference with pretrained VLMs, LoRA-based fine-tuning of LLaVA-NeXT-Video-7B, and personalized federated learning of a 65.8M-parameter 3D CNN. All methods exceed 90% accuracy in binary violence detection. The 3D CNN achieves superior calibration (ROC AUC 92.59%) at roughly half the energy cost (240 Wh vs. 570 Wh) of federated LoRA, while VLMs provide richer multimodal reasoning. Hierarchical category grouping (based on semantic similarity and class exclusion) boosts VLM multiclass accuracy from 65.31% to 81% on the UCF-Crime dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first comparative simulation study of LoRA-tuned VLMs and personalized CNNs for federated violence detection, with explicit energy and CO2e quantification. Our results inform hybrid deployment strategies that default to efficient CNNs for routine inference and selectively engage VLMs for complex contextual reasoning.

*Seungheon Song,Jaekoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel vision-language approach for OOD segmentation in autonomous driving that uses text-driven learning, distance-based prompts, and semantic augmentation to detect anomalous objects, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OOD segmentation methods for autonomous driving don't fully leverage rich linguistic knowledge from vision-language space, which could be particularly beneficial for complex real-world driving scenarios where detecting anomalous objects is critical for safety.

Method: Combines vision-language model encoder with transformer decoder, employs Distance-Based OOD prompts at varying semantic distances from ID classes, and uses OOD Semantic Augmentation for OOD representations to align visual and textual information.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across pixel-level and object-level evaluations on Fishyscapes, Segment-Me-If-You-Can, and Road Anomaly datasets.

Conclusion: Vision-language-based OOD segmentation has strong potential to enhance safety and reliability of autonomous driving systems by effectively generalizing to unseen objects in diverse driving environments.

Abstract: In autonomous driving and robotics, ensuring road safety and reliable decision-making critically depends on out-of-distribution (OOD) segmentation. While numerous methods have been proposed to detect anomalous objects on the road, leveraging the vision-language space-which provides rich linguistic knowledge-remains an underexplored field. We hypothesize that incorporating these linguistic cues can be especially beneficial in the complex contexts found in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.
  To this end, we present a novel approach that trains a Text-Driven OOD Segmentation model to learn a semantically diverse set of objects in the vision-language space. Concretely, our approach combines a vision-language model's encoder with a transformer decoder, employs Distance-Based OOD prompts located at varying semantic distances from in-distribution (ID) classes, and utilizes OOD Semantic Augmentation for OOD representations. By aligning visual and textual information, our approach effectively generalizes to unseen objects and provides robust OOD segmentation in diverse driving environments.
  We conduct extensive experiments on publicly available OOD segmentation datasets such as Fishyscapes, Segment-Me-If-You-Can, and Road Anomaly datasets, demonstrating that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across both pixel-level and object-level evaluations. This result underscores the potential of vision-language-based OOD segmentation to bolster the safety and reliability of future autonomous driving systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SportR is a multi-sports benchmark with 5,017 images and 2,101 videos that evaluates multimodal models' ability to perform fine-grained visual perception and rule-based reasoning across sports, featuring progressive question complexity and Chain of Thought annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sports benchmarks lack detailed reasoning chains and precise visual grounding needed to evaluate core capabilities like nuanced visual perception, sport rule knowledge application, and visual evidence grounding in a multi-sport context.

Method: Created a large-scale benchmark with hierarchical QA pairs progressing from simple infraction identification to complex penalty prediction, including 7,118 human-authored Chain of Thought annotations for multi-step reasoning tasks, with both image/video modalities and manual bounding box annotations.

Result: State-of-the-art baseline models perform poorly on the most challenging tasks. While training on SportR data via Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning improves scores, performance remains relatively low, highlighting significant capability gaps.

Conclusion: SportR presents a challenging benchmark that exposes limitations in current multimodal models' sports reasoning capabilities and provides a critical resource to drive future research in multimodal sports intelligence.

Abstract: Deeply understanding sports requires an intricate blend of fine-grained visual perception and rule-based reasoning - a challenge that pushes the limits of current multimodal models. To succeed, models must master three critical capabilities: perceiving nuanced visual details, applying abstract sport rule knowledge, and grounding that knowledge in specific visual evidence. Current sports benchmarks either cover single sports or lack the detailed reasoning chains and precise visual grounding needed to robustly evaluate these core capabilities in a multi-sport context. To address this gap, we introduce SportR, the first multi-sports large-scale benchmark designed to train and evaluate MLLMs on the fundamental reasoning required for sports intelligence. Our benchmark provides a dataset of 5,017 images and 2,101 videos. To enable granular evaluation, we structure our benchmark around a progressive hierarchy of question-answer (QA) pairs designed to probe reasoning at increasing depths - from simple infraction identification to complex penalty prediction. For the most advanced tasks requiring multi-step reasoning, such as determining penalties or explaining tactics, we provide 7,118 high-quality, human-authored Chain of Thought (CoT) annotations. In addition, our benchmark incorporates both image and video modalities and provides manual bounding box annotations to test visual grounding in the image part directly. Extensive experiments demonstrate the profound difficulty of our benchmark. State-of-the-art baseline models perform poorly on our most challenging tasks. While training on our data via Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning improves these scores, they remain relatively low, highlighting a significant gap in current model capabilities. SportR presents a new challenge for the community, providing a critical resource to drive future research in multimodal sports reasoning.

Abstract: Robotic- and computer-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS) is increasingly relying on computer vision methods for reliable instrument recognition and surgical workflow understanding. Developing such systems often requires large, well-annotated datasets, but existing resources often address isolated tasks, neglect temporal dependencies, or lack multi-center variability. We present the Surgical Procedure Phase, Keypoint, and Instrument Recognition (PhaKIR) dataset, comprising eight complete laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos recorded at three medical centers. The dataset provides frame-level annotations for three interconnected tasks: surgical phase recognition (485,875 frames), instrument keypoint estimation (19,435 frames), and instrument instance segmentation (19,435 frames). PhaKIR is, to our knowledge, the first multi-institutional dataset to jointly provide phase labels, instrument pose information, and pixel-accurate instrument segmentations, while also enabling the exploitation of temporal context since full surgical procedure sequences are available. It served as the basis for the PhaKIR Challenge as part of the Endoscopic Vision (EndoVis) Challenge at MICCAI 2024 to benchmark methods in surgical scene understanding, thereby further validating the dataset's quality and relevance.

### [146] [Spatial-Frequency Enhanced Mamba for Multi-Modal Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06593)
*Hui Sun,Long Lv,Pingping Zhang,Tongdan Tang,Feng Tian,Weibing Sun,Huchuan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SFMFusion is a novel multi-modal image fusion framework that enhances Mamba with spatial-frequency perception and uses a three-branch structure to couple image fusion with image reconstruction for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MMIF methods using CNNs have limited receptive fields while Transformers have high computational costs. Mamba shows promise for long-range dependencies but lacks spatial and frequency perception needed for MMIF. Also, image reconstruction as an auxiliary task can benefit MMIF but needs efficient implementation.

Method: Proposes SFMFusion with three key components: 1) Three-branch structure coupling MMIF and IR to retain complete image contents, 2) Spatial-Frequency Enhanced Mamba Block (SFMB) for comprehensive feature extraction in both domains, 3) Dynamic Fusion Mamba Block (DFMB) for cross-branch dynamic feature fusion.

Result: Extensive experiments show SFMFusion achieves better results than most state-of-the-art methods on six MMIF datasets, demonstrating superior performance.

Conclusion: SFMFusion effectively addresses limitations of existing MMIF methods by enhancing Mamba with spatial-frequency perception and efficiently leveraging image reconstruction as an auxiliary task, providing a powerful solution for multi-modal image fusion.

Abstract: Multi-Modal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate complementary image information from different modalities to produce informative images. Previous deep learning-based MMIF methods generally adopt Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Transformers for feature extraction. However, these methods deliver unsatisfactory performances due to the limited receptive field of CNNs and the high computational cost of Transformers. Recently, Mamba has demonstrated a powerful potential for modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, providing a promising solution to MMIF. Unfortunately, Mamba lacks full spatial and frequency perceptions, which are very important for MMIF. Moreover, employing Image Reconstruction (IR) as an auxiliary task has been proven beneficial for MMIF. However, a primary challenge is how to leverage IR efficiently and effectively. To address the above issues, we propose a novel framework named Spatial-Frequency Enhanced Mamba Fusion (SFMFusion) for MMIF. More specifically, we first propose a three-branch structure to couple MMIF and IR, which can retain complete contents from source images. Then, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Enhanced Mamba Block (SFMB), which can enhance Mamba in both spatial and frequency domains for comprehensive feature extraction. Finally, we propose the Dynamic Fusion Mamba Block (DFMB), which can be deployed across different branches for dynamic feature fusion. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves better results than most state-of-the-art methods on six MMIF datasets. The source code is available at https://github.com/SunHui1216/SFMFusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-dose CT improves patient safety but suffers from increased noise, blur, and contrast loss that diminish diagnostic quality, requiring consistent and robust image quality assessment for clinical applications.

Method: Developed an LLM-based quality assessment system that generates numerical scores and textual descriptions, systematically examining various inference strategies including zero-shot approach, metadata integration, and error feedback.

Result: The system produces highly correlated scores and interpretable output, with progressive performance improvements from each inference strategy, adding value to clinical workflows.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM-based assessment system effectively evaluates low-dose CT image quality with both quantitative scores and qualitative descriptions, demonstrating the value of systematic inference strategy development for clinical applications.

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (CT) represents a significant improvement in patient safety through lower radiation doses, but increased noise, blur, and contrast loss can diminish diagnostic quality. Therefore, consistency and robustness in image quality assessment become essential for clinical applications. In this study, we propose an LLM-based quality assessment system that generates both numerical scores and textual descriptions of degradations such as noise, blur, and contrast loss. Furthermore, various inference strategies - from the zero-shot approach to metadata integration and error feedback - are systematically examined, demonstrating the progressive contribution of each method to overall performance. The resultant assessments yield not only highly correlated scores but also interpretable output, thereby adding value to clinical workflows.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel SFOD framework that leverages Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) as external knowledge to enhance feature alignment and label quality through three modules: PGFA, PIFA, and DEPF, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SFOD methods rely on internal source model knowledge, limiting generalization and causing biased pseudo-labels. VFMs offer strong perception and generalization capabilities but are underutilized in SFOD.

Method: Three VFM-based modules: (1) PGFA for global feature alignment using patch-similarity weighting, (2) PIFA for instance-level contrastive learning with momentum-updated prototypes, and (3) DEPF for fusing predictions from detection VFMs and teacher models via entropy-aware strategy.

Result: Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art SFOD performance, validating improved transferability and discriminability.

Conclusion: Integrating VFMs as external knowledge effectively enhances both feature alignment and label quality in SFOD, addressing limitations of internal knowledge-based approaches.

Abstract: Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) aims to adapt a source-pretrained object detector to a target domain without access to source data. However, existing SFOD methods predominantly rely on internal knowledge from the source model, which limits their capacity to generalize across domains and often results in biased pseudo-labels, thereby hindering both transferability and discriminability. In contrast, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), pretrained on massive and diverse data, exhibit strong perception capabilities and broad generalization, yet their potential remains largely untapped in the SFOD setting. In this paper, we propose a novel SFOD framework that leverages VFMs as external knowledge sources to jointly enhance feature alignment and label quality. Specifically, we design three VFM-based modules: (1) Patch-weighted Global Feature Alignment (PGFA) distills global features from VFMs using patch-similarity-based weighting to enhance global feature transferability; (2) Prototype-based Instance Feature Alignment (PIFA) performs instance-level contrastive learning guided by momentum-updated VFM prototypes; and (3) Dual-source Enhanced Pseudo-label Fusion (DEPF) fuses predictions from detection VFMs and teacher models via an entropy-aware strategy to yield more reliable supervision. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art SFOD performance, validating the effectiveness of integrating VFMs to simultaneously improve transferability and discriminability.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an inference-time scaling approach using a domain-adapted CLIP-based verifier to enhance infrared image generation quality, addressing data scarcity in infrared vision applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared imagery enables temperature-based scene understanding in low visibility conditions, but developing vision models is hindered by scarce annotated data due to specialized annotation requirements. Synthetic infrared image generation could help but faces challenges due to limited datasets for training foundation-level generative models.

Method: Adapt FLUX.1-dev text-to-image diffusion model to infrared domain by finetuning on small infrared image samples using parameter-efficient techniques. Use trained CLIP-based verifier during inference to guide diffusion sampling toward higher quality infrared generations that better align with text prompts.

Result: The approach leads to consistent improvements in generation quality, reducing FID scores on KAIST Multispectral Pedestrian Detection Benchmark dataset by 10% compared to unguided baseline samples.

Conclusion: Inference-time guidance offers a promising direction for bridging the domain gap in low-data infrared settings, enabling better synthetic infrared image generation despite limited training data.

Abstract: Infrared imagery enables temperature-based scene understanding using passive sensors, particularly under conditions of low visibility where traditional RGB imaging fails. Yet, developing downstream vision models for infrared applications is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality annotated data, due to the specialized expertise required for infrared annotation. While synthetic infrared image generation has the potential to accelerate model development by providing large-scale, diverse training data, training foundation-level generative diffusion models in the infrared domain has remained elusive due to limited datasets. In light of such data constraints, we explore an inference-time scaling approach using a domain-adapted CLIP-based verifier for enhanced infrared image generation quality. We adapt FLUX.1-dev, a state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion model, to the infrared domain by finetuning it on a small sample of infrared images using parameter-efficient techniques. The trained verifier is then employed during inference to guide the diffusion sampling process toward higher quality infrared generations that better align with input text prompts. Empirically, we find that our approach leads to consistent improvements in generation quality, reducing FID scores on the KAIST Multispectral Pedestrian Detection Benchmark dataset by 10% compared to unguided baseline samples. Our results suggest that inference-time guidance offers a promising direction for bridging the domain gap in low-data infrared settings.

TL;DR: DIAL-GS is a self-supervised method for dynamic instance-aware urban scene reconstruction using 4D Gaussian Splatting, enabling label-free reconstruction with fine-grained editing capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current supervised methods require costly human annotations and lack scalability, while self-supervised methods struggle to distinguish static/dynamic elements and individual dynamic objects, limiting fine-grained editing.

Method: Uses appearance-position inconsistency to identify dynamic instances, employs instance-aware 4D Gaussians as unified volumetric representation, and implements reciprocal mechanism where identity and dynamics reinforce each other.

Result: Surpasses existing self-supervised baselines in reconstruction quality and instance-level editing on urban driving scenarios.

Conclusion: Provides a concise yet powerful solution for urban scene modeling with dynamic instance-aware reconstruction capabilities.

Abstract: Urban scene reconstruction is critical for autonomous driving, enabling structured 3D representations for data synthesis and closed-loop testing. Supervised approaches rely on costly human annotations and lack scalability, while current self-supervised methods often confuse static and dynamic elements and fail to distinguish individual dynamic objects, limiting fine-grained editing. We propose DIAL-GS, a novel dynamic instance-aware reconstruction method for label-free street scenes with 4D Gaussian Splatting. We first accurately identify dynamic instances by exploiting appearance-position inconsistency between warped rendering and actual observation. Guided by instance-level dynamic perception, we employ instance-aware 4D Gaussians as the unified volumetric representation, realizing dynamic-adaptive and instance-aware reconstruction. Furthermore, we introduce a reciprocal mechanism through which identity and dynamics reinforce each other, enhancing both integrity and consistency. Experiments on urban driving scenarios show that DIAL-GS surpasses existing self-supervised baselines in reconstruction quality and instance-level editing, offering a concise yet powerful solution for urban scene modeling.

TL;DR: UniADC is a unified model for simultaneous anomaly detection and classification in images, using a controllable inpainting network and multi-task discriminator to handle both tasks with limited anomaly data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat anomaly detection and classification as separate tasks, neglecting their inherent correlation and limiting information sharing, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Proposes UniADC with two components: (1) training-free controllable inpainting network that synthesizes anomaly images by repainting normal regions using anomaly priors, and (2) multi-task discriminator trained on synthesized samples to align fine-grained image features with anomaly-category embeddings.

Result: Extensive experiments on MVTec-FS, MTD, and WFDD datasets show UniADC consistently outperforms existing methods in anomaly detection, localization, and classification.

Conclusion: UniADC effectively unifies anomaly detection and classification, achieving superior performance with limited anomaly data through synthetic data generation and multi-task learning.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the task of unified anomaly detection and classification, which aims to simultaneously detect anomalous regions in images and identify their specific categories. Existing methods typically treat anomaly detection and classification as separate tasks, thereby neglecting their inherent correlation, limiting information sharing, and resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose UniADC, a unified anomaly detection and classification model that can effectively perform both tasks with only a few or even no anomaly images. Specifically, UniADC consists of two key components: a training-free controllable inpainting network and a multi-task discriminator. The inpainting network can synthesize anomaly images of specific categories by repainting normal regions guided by anomaly priors, and can also repaint few-shot anomaly samples to augment the available anomaly data. The multi-task discriminator is then trained on these synthesized samples, enabling precise anomaly detection and classification by aligning fine-grained image features with anomaly-category embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments on three anomaly detection and classification datasets, including MVTec-FS, MTD, and WFDD, and the results demonstrate that UniADC consistently outperforms existing methods in anomaly detection, localization, and classification.

TL;DR: SpatialThinker is a 3D-aware multimodal LLM that integrates spatial grounding with multi-step reasoning using RL training, achieving superior spatial understanding with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with spatial understanding despite progress in vision-language tasks, and existing approaches rely on explicit 3D inputs, architecture modifications, or large datasets.

Method: Uses RL training with dense spatial rewards, constructs scene graphs of objects and spatial relations, and includes a data synthesis pipeline generating STVQA-7K dataset.

Result: SpatialThinker-7B outperforms supervised fine-tuning and sparse RL baselines, nearly doubles base-model gain compared to sparse RL, and surpasses GPT-4o on spatial understanding benchmarks.

Conclusion: Combining spatial supervision with reward-aligned reasoning enables robust 3D spatial understanding with limited data and advances MLLMs toward human-level visual reasoning.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in vision-language tasks, but they continue to struggle with spatial understanding. Existing spatial MLLMs often rely on explicit 3D inputs or architecture-specific modifications, and remain constrained by large-scale datasets or sparse supervision. To address these limitations, we introduce SpatialThinker, a 3D-aware MLLM trained with RL to integrate structured spatial grounding with multi-step reasoning. The model simulates human-like spatial perception by constructing a scene graph of task-relevant objects and spatial relations, and reasoning towards an answer via dense spatial rewards. SpatialThinker consists of two key contributions: (1) a data synthesis pipeline that generates STVQA-7K, a high-quality spatial VQA dataset, and (2) online RL with a multi-objective dense spatial reward enforcing spatial grounding. SpatialThinker-7B outperforms supervised fine-tuning and the sparse RL baseline on spatial understanding and real-world VQA benchmarks, nearly doubling the base-model gain compared to sparse RL, and surpassing GPT-4o. These results showcase the effectiveness of combining spatial supervision with reward-aligned reasoning in enabling robust 3D spatial understanding with limited data and advancing MLLMs towards human-level visual reasoning.

*Siqi Hui,Sanping Zhou,Ye deng,Wenli Huang,Jinjun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreqGRL is a frequency-space framework for cross-domain few-shot learning that addresses data imbalance by replacing low-frequency components from source with target data and enhancing high-frequency features to improve cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the severe imbalance between abundant source data and scarce target data in CD-FSL, where models are biased toward source-specific low-frequency knowledge and struggle to learn domain-generalizable high-frequency features.

Method: Proposes FreqGRL with three modules: Low-Frequency Replacement (LFR) substitutes source low-frequency components with target ones; High-Frequency Enhancement (HFE) learns directly on high-frequency features; Global Frequency Filter (GFF) suppresses noisy frequencies and emphasizes informative ones.

Result: Extensive experiments on five standard CD-FSL benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, showing effectiveness in mitigating data imbalance and improving cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: The frequency-space perspective effectively addresses CD-FSL challenges, with FreqGRL providing a novel solution that reduces source bias and enhances domain-generalizable feature learning through frequency manipulation.

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot learning (CD-FSL) aims to recognize novel classes with only a few labeled examples under significant domain shifts. While recent approaches leverage a limited amount of labeled target-domain data to improve performance, the severe imbalance between abundant source data and scarce target data remains a critical challenge for effective representation learning. We present the first frequency-space perspective to analyze this issue and identify two key challenges: (1) models are easily biased toward source-specific knowledge encoded in the low-frequency components of source data, and (2) the sparsity of target data hinders the learning of high-frequency, domain-generalizable features. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{FreqGRL}, a novel CD-FSL framework that mitigates the impact of data imbalance in the frequency space. Specifically, we introduce a Low-Frequency Replacement (LFR) module that substitutes the low-frequency components of source tasks with those from the target domain to create new source tasks that better align with target characteristics, thus reducing source-specific biases and promoting generalizable representation learning. We further design a High-Frequency Enhancement (HFE) module that filters out low-frequency components and performs learning directly on high-frequency features in the frequency space to improve cross-domain generalization. Additionally, a Global Frequency Filter (GFF) is incorporated to suppress noisy or irrelevant frequencies and emphasize informative ones, mitigating overfitting risks under limited target supervision. Extensive experiments on five standard CD-FSL benchmarks demonstrate that our frequency-guided framework achieves state-of-the-art performance.

*Kyung-Yoon Yoon,Yeong-Jun Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NOVO is a visual-only prompting framework that connects vision-language models with segmentation models by generating coarse masks and point prompts for SAM, achieving state-of-the-art performance in reasoning segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge vision-language models and segmentation models without relying on text-derived embeddings, instead using visual-only prompts that align with SAM's pretrained capabilities.

Method: Generates coarse masks and point prompts from VLM output for SAM, plus a training-free refinement module to improve boundary quality and enable instance-level segmentation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics and model sizes on the new RISeg benchmark (918 images, 2,533 masks).

Conclusion: NOVO demonstrates effectiveness and scalability in reasoning segmentation through visual-only prompts that preserve SAM's capabilities.

Abstract: In this study, we propose NOVO (NO text, Visual-Only prompts), a novel framework that bridges vision-language models (VLMs) and segmentation models through visual-only prompts. Unlike prior approaches that feed text-derived SEG token embeddings into segmentation models, NOVO instead generates a coarse mask and point prompts from the VLM output. These visual prompts are compatible with the Segment Anything Model (SAM), preserving alignment with its pretrained capabilities. To further enhance boundary quality and enable instance-level segmentation, we introduce a training-free refinement module that reduces visual artifacts and improves the quality of segmentation masks. We also present RISeg, a new benchmark comprising 918 images, 2,533 instance-level masks, and diverse reasoning queries to evaluate this task. Experiments demonstrate that NOVO achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics and model sizes, demonstrating its effectiveness and scalability in reasoning segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiMo-CLIP enhances CLIP-style models by introducing hierarchical decomposition and monotonicity-aware contrastive loss to better handle complex, compositional text descriptions in image-text retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current contrastive vision-language models like CLIP treat text as flat sequences, failing to capture semantic hierarchy and monotonicity - where richer descriptions should result in stronger visual alignment.

Method: Proposes HiMo-CLIP with two components: HiDe module for hierarchical decomposition of text via in-batch PCA, and MoLo loss for joint alignment of global and component-level representations with semantic ordering.

Result: HiMo-CLIP consistently outperforms strong baselines on multiple image-text retrieval benchmarks, especially for long or compositional descriptions.

Conclusion: The framework successfully produces structured, cognitively-aligned cross-modal representations without modifying encoder architecture, addressing key limitations in handling complex language structures.

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models like CLIP have achieved impressive results in image-text retrieval by aligning image and text representations in a shared embedding space. However, these models often treat text as flat sequences, limiting their ability to handle complex, compositional, and long-form descriptions. In particular, they fail to capture two essential properties of language: semantic hierarchy, which reflects the multi-level compositional structure of text, and semantic monotonicity, where richer descriptions should result in stronger alignment with visual content.To address these limitations, we propose HiMo-CLIP, a representation-level framework that enhances CLIP-style models without modifying the encoder architecture. HiMo-CLIP introduces two key components: a hierarchical decomposition (HiDe) module that extracts latent semantic components from long-form text via in-batch PCA, enabling flexible, batch-aware alignment across different semantic granularities, and a monotonicity-aware contrastive loss (MoLo) that jointly aligns global and component-level representations, encouraging the model to internalize semantic ordering and alignment strength as a function of textual completeness.These components work in concert to produce structured, cognitively-aligned cross-modal representations. Experiments on multiple image-text retrieval benchmarks show that HiMo-CLIP consistently outperforms strong baselines, particularly under long or compositional descriptions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-based 3D occupancy prediction struggles in challenging environments with cameras alone, and existing camera-radar fusion approaches are limited by radar data sparsity and noise.

Method: Proposes REOcc with two main components: Radar Densifier (integrates spatial information to enhance spatial density) and Radar Amplifier (integrates contextual information to improve feature quality).

Result: Extensive experiments on Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark show significant performance gains over camera-only baseline, especially for dynamic object classes, effectively mitigating radar sparsity and noise.

Conclusion: REOcc successfully enhances radar feature representations, enabling more effective camera-radar fusion for robust and reliable 3D occupancy prediction by complementing camera data better.

Abstract: Vision-based 3D occupancy prediction has made significant advancements, but its reliance on cameras alone struggles in challenging environments. This limitation has driven the adoption of sensor fusion, among which camera-radar fusion stands out as a promising solution due to their complementary strengths. However, the sparsity and noise of the radar data limits its effectiveness, leading to suboptimal fusion performance. In this paper, we propose REOcc, a novel camera-radar fusion network designed to enrich radar feature representations for 3D occupancy prediction. Our approach introduces two main components, a Radar Densifier and a Radar Amplifier, which refine radar features by integrating spatial and contextual information, effectively enhancing spatial density and quality. Extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that REOcc achieves significant performance gains over the camera-only baseline model, particularly in dynamic object classes. These results underscore REOcc's capability to mitigate the sparsity and noise of the radar data. Consequently, radar complements camera data more effectively, unlocking the full potential of camera-radar fusion for robust and reliable 3D occupancy prediction.

TL;DR: FCBM enables dynamic concept adaptation in concept bottleneck models without full retraining, using a hypernetwork for weight generation and sparsemax for concept selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLM-based CBMs require full model retraining when new concepts are introduced, limiting adaptability in real-world scenarios with rapidly evolving foundation models.

Method: Proposes FCBM with a hypernetwork that generates prediction weights from concept embeddings, and a modified sparsemax module with learnable temperature for dynamic concept selection.

Result: Achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art baselines on five benchmarks, generalizes well to unseen concepts with minimal fine-tuning.

Conclusion: FCBM demonstrates strong adaptability and flexibility for dynamic concept adaptation in concept bottleneck models.

Abstract: Concept bottleneck models (CBMs) improve neural network interpretability by introducing an intermediate layer that maps human-understandable concepts to predictions. Recent work has explored the use of vision-language models (VLMs) to automate concept selection and annotation. However, existing VLM-based CBMs typically require full model retraining when new concepts are involved, which limits their adaptability and flexibility in real-world scenarios, especially considering the rapid evolution of vision-language foundation models. To address these issues, we propose Flexible Concept Bottleneck Model (FCBM), which supports dynamic concept adaptation, including complete replacement of the original concept set. Specifically, we design a hypernetwork that generates prediction weights based on concept embeddings, allowing seamless integration of new concepts without retraining the entire model. In addition, we introduce a modified sparsemax module with a learnable temperature parameter that dynamically selects the most relevant concepts, enabling the model to focus on the most informative features. Extensive experiments on five public benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art baselines with a similar number of effective concepts. Moreover, the model generalizes well to unseen concepts with just a single epoch of fine-tuning, demonstrating its strong adaptability and flexibility.

*Yulim So,Seokho Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnoStyler is a lightweight zero-shot anomaly generation method that frames the task as text-guided style transfer, using a single normal image and text prompts to generate realistic anomalies without requiring large datasets or heavy models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anomaly generation methods suffer from poor visual realism, dependence on large real image datasets, and use of memory-intensive models, limiting their practical deployment.

Method: Given a single normal image with category label and defect type, generates anomaly mask and text prompts, then uses lightweight U-Net with CLIP-based loss to stylize normal image into realistic anomalies localized by mask and aligned with text prompts.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets in generating high-quality, diverse anomaly images, and enhances anomaly detection performance when used for training.

Conclusion: AnoStyler provides an effective lightweight solution for zero-shot anomaly generation that overcomes key limitations of existing approaches while improving anomaly detection capabilities.

Abstract: Anomaly generation has been widely explored to address the scarcity of anomaly images in real-world data. However, existing methods typically suffer from at least one of the following limitations, hindering their practical deployment: (1) lack of visual realism in generated anomalies; (2) dependence on large amounts of real images; and (3) use of memory-intensive, heavyweight model architectures. To overcome these limitations, we propose AnoStyler, a lightweight yet effective method that frames zero-shot anomaly generation as text-guided style transfer. Given a single normal image along with its category label and expected defect type, an anomaly mask indicating the localized anomaly regions and two-class text prompts representing the normal and anomaly states are generated using generalizable category-agnostic procedures. A lightweight U-Net model trained with CLIP-based loss functions is used to stylize the normal image into a visually realistic anomaly image, where anomalies are localized by the anomaly mask and semantically aligned with the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the MVTec-AD and VisA datasets show that AnoStyler outperforms existing anomaly generation methods in generating high-quality and diverse anomaly images. Furthermore, using these generated anomalies helps enhance anomaly detection performance.

### [159] [SPAN: Spatial-Projection Alignment for Monocular 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06702)
*Yifan Wang,Yian Zhao,Fanqi Pu,Xiaochen Yang,Yang Tang,Xi Chen,Wenming Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPAN introduces spatial-projection alignment to address geometric inconsistency in monocular 3D detection by enforcing global spatial constraints and 3D-2D projection alignment, with hierarchical learning for stable training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing monocular 3D detectors use decoupled prediction that ignores geometric collaborative constraints between attributes, leading to geometric inconsistency and suboptimal performance.

Method: Proposes Spatial-Projection Alignment (SPAN) with: (i) Spatial Point Alignment for global spatial constraints, (ii) 3D-2D Projection Alignment for tight box alignment, and (iii) Hierarchical Task Learning for stable training.

Result: Extensive experiments show SPAN can be easily integrated into existing monocular 3D detectors and delivers significant performance improvements.

Conclusion: SPAN effectively addresses geometric inconsistency in monocular 3D detection through spatial-projection alignment, improving performance while maintaining compatibility with existing detectors.

Abstract: Existing monocular 3D detectors typically tame the pronounced nonlinear regression of 3D bounding box through decoupled prediction paradigm, which employs multiple branches to estimate geometric center, depth, dimensions, and rotation angle separately. Although this decoupling strategy simplifies the learning process, it inherently ignores the geometric collaborative constraints between different attributes, resulting in the lack of geometric consistency prior, thereby leading to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we propose novel Spatial-Projection Alignment (SPAN) with two pivotal components: (i). Spatial Point Alignment enforces an explicit global spatial constraint between the predicted and ground-truth 3D bounding boxes, thereby rectifying spatial drift caused by decoupled attribute regression. (ii). 3D-2D Projection Alignment ensures that the projected 3D box is aligned tightly within its corresponding 2D detection bounding box on the image plane, mitigating projection misalignment overlooked in previous works. To ensure training stability, we further introduce a Hierarchical Task Learning strategy that progressively incorporates spatial-projection alignment as 3D attribute predictions refine, preventing early stage error propagation across attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can be easily integrated into any established monocular 3D detector and delivers significant performance improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing virtual staining methods struggle with effective spatial information utilization due to misalignment in tissue slices, making it difficult to achieve accurate IHC image synthesis from H&E images without costly chemical processes.

Method: K-Stain framework with three components: Hierarchical Spatial Keypoint Detector (HSKD) for identifying keypoints, Keypoint-aware Enhancement Generator (KEG) for integrating keypoints during generation, and Keypoint Guided Discriminator (KGD) for improved spatial detail sensitivity.

Result: Extensive experiments show K-Stain outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality, producing more accurate and visually consistent IHC images.

Conclusion: The keypoint-based approach effectively addresses spatial misalignment issues in virtual staining, enabling more precise alignment and integration of structural details for improved IHC image synthesis from H&E images.

Abstract: Virtual staining offers a promising method for converting Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) images into Immunohistochemical (IHC) images, eliminating the need for costly chemical processes. However, existing methods often struggle to utilize spatial information effectively due to misalignment in tissue slices. To overcome this challenge, we leverage keypoints as robust indicators of spatial correspondence, enabling more precise alignment and integration of structural details in synthesized IHC images. We introduce K-Stain, a novel framework that employs keypoint-based spatial and semantic relationships to enhance synthesized IHC image fidelity. K-Stain comprises three main components: (1) a Hierarchical Spatial Keypoint Detector (HSKD) for identifying keypoints in stain images, (2) a Keypoint-aware Enhancement Generator (KEG) that integrates these keypoints during image generation, and (3) a Keypoint Guided Discriminator (KGD) that improves the discriminator's sensitivity to spatial details. Our approach leverages contextual information from adjacent slices, resulting in more accurate and visually consistent IHC images. Extensive experiments show that K-Stain outperforms state-of-the-art methods in quantitative metrics and visual quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a Mixed RWKV-Transformer (MRT) architecture for extreme image compression that encodes images into 1-D latent representations, achieving significant bitrate savings compared to state-of-the-art 2-D methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image compression methods using 2-D latent spaces via CNNs or Swin Transformers retain substantial spatial redundancy, limiting compression performance. The goal is to create more compact representations by moving to 1-D latent spaces.

Method: Uses a Mixed RWKV-Transformer architecture that partitions images into windows, with RWKV modules capturing global dependencies across windows and Transformer blocks modeling local redundancies within windows. Also introduces a dedicated RWKV Compression Model (RCM) for intermediate 1-D latent features.

Result: Achieves superior reconstruction quality at bitrates below 0.02 bpp. Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GLC with bitrate savings of 43.75% on Kodak and 30.59% on CLIC2020 datasets based on DISTS metric.

Conclusion: The MRT framework effectively reduces spatial redundancy by encoding images into 1-D latent representations through synergistic integration of RWKV and Transformer models, demonstrating substantial improvements in extreme image compression efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances in extreme image compression have revealed that mapping pixel data into highly compact latent representations can significantly improve coding efficiency. However, most existing methods compress images into 2-D latent spaces via convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Swin Transformers, which tend to retain substantial spatial redundancy, thereby limiting overall compression performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Mixed RWKV-Transformer (MRT) architecture that encodes images into more compact 1-D latent representations by synergistically integrating the complementary strengths of linear-attention-based RWKV and self-attention-based Transformer models. Specifically, MRT partitions each image into fixed-size windows, utilizing RWKV modules to capture global dependencies across windows and Transformer blocks to model local redundancies within each window. The hierarchical attention mechanism enables more efficient and compact representation learning in the 1-D domain. To further enhance compression efficiency, we introduce a dedicated RWKV Compression Model (RCM) tailored to the structure characteristics of the intermediate 1-D latent features in MRT. Extensive experiments on standard image compression benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach. The proposed MRT framework consistently achieves superior reconstruction quality at bitrates below 0.02 bits per pixel (bpp). Quantitative results based on the DISTS metric show that MRT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art 2-D architecture GLC, achieving bitrate savings of 43.75%, 30.59% on the Kodak and CLIC2020 test datasets, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: REL is a novel framework for OOD detection in LiDAR point clouds that uses relative energy scoring and synthetic outlier generation to improve reliability in autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LiDAR OOD methods fail to distinguish rare anomalies from common classes, causing high false positives and overconfident errors in safety-critical autonomous driving scenarios.

Method: Proposes Relative Energy Learning (REL) using energy gap between positive/negative logits as scoring function, plus Point Raise - a lightweight data synthesis strategy that perturbs existing point clouds to generate auxiliary anomalies.

Result: REL consistently outperforms existing methods by large margins on SemanticKITTI and STU benchmarks, demonstrating improved robustness across various scenes.

Conclusion: Modeling relative energy combined with simple synthetic outliers provides a principled and scalable solution for reliable OOD detection in open-world autonomous driving.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical requirement for reliable autonomous driving, where safety depends on recognizing road obstacles and unexpected objects beyond the training distribution. Despite extensive research on OOD detection in 2D images, direct transfer to 3D LiDAR point clouds has been proven ineffective. Current LiDAR OOD methods struggle to distinguish rare anomalies from common classes, leading to high false-positive rates and overconfident errors in safety-critical settings. We propose Relative Energy Learning (REL), a simple yet effective framework for OOD detection in LiDAR point clouds. REL leverages the energy gap between positive (in-distribution) and negative logits as a relative scoring function, mitigating calibration issues in raw energy values and improving robustness across various scenes. To address the absence of OOD samples during training, we propose a lightweight data synthesis strategy called Point Raise, which perturbs existing point clouds to generate auxiliary anomalies without altering the inlier semantics. Evaluated on SemanticKITTI and the Spotting the Unexpected (STU) benchmark, REL consistently outperforms existing methods by a large margin. Our results highlight that modeling relative energy, combined with simple synthetic outliers, provides a principled and scalable solution for reliable OOD detection in open-world autonomous driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with stylized avatars due to lack of diverse multi-style datasets and challenges in maintaining geometric consistency in non-standard textures.

Method: Three-stage diffusion-to-GAN pipeline: 1) diffusion-based inpainting for missing regions, 2) GAN-based latent optimization for style/structure consistency, 3) diffusion-based repainting for fine details. Uses TexHub dataset of 20,000 multi-style UV textures.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art in multi-style facial texture reconstruction with high-quality topology-aligned texture synthesis and both artistic/geometric coherence.

Conclusion: AvatarTex successfully integrates diffusion models' diversity with GANs' structured latent space for robust facial texture reconstruction, and TexHub dataset will facilitate future research.

Abstract: We present AvatarTex, a high-fidelity facial texture reconstruction framework capable of generating both stylized and photorealistic textures from a single image. Existing methods struggle with stylized avatars due to the lack of diverse multi-style datasets and challenges in maintaining geometric consistency in non-standard textures. To address these limitations, AvatarTex introduces a novel three-stage diffusion-to-GAN pipeline. Our key insight is that while diffusion models excel at generating diversified textures, they lack explicit UV constraints, whereas GANs provide a well-structured latent space that ensures style and topology consistency. By integrating these strengths, AvatarTex achieves high-quality topology-aligned texture synthesis with both artistic and geometric coherence. Specifically, our three-stage pipeline first completes missing texture regions via diffusion-based inpainting, refines style and structure consistency using GAN-based latent optimization, and enhances fine details through diffusion-based repainting. To address the need for a stylized texture dataset, we introduce TexHub, a high-resolution collection of 20,000 multi-style UV textures with precise UV-aligned layouts. By leveraging TexHub and our structured diffusion-to-GAN pipeline, AvatarTex establishes a new state-of-the-art in multi-style facial texture reconstruction. TexHub will be released upon publication to facilitate future research in this field.

TL;DR: Argus is a high-throughput text-to-image inference system that intelligently selects appropriate approximation levels for each prompt to maintain quality while meeting throughput targets, achieving significant improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models are compute-bound with high inference times due to iterative denoising processes, creating challenges for high-throughput systems. Many prompts can be served using faster approximated models, but approximation must be carefully calibrated to avoid quality degradation.

Method: Argus intelligently switches between different approximation strategies for each prompt, selecting the right level of approximation to maintain quality while meeting throughput targets on a fixed-size cluster.

Result: Argus achieves 10x fewer latency SLO violations, 10% higher average quality, and 40% higher throughput compared to baselines on two real-world workload traces.

Conclusion: The system successfully addresses the challenge of designing high-throughput T2I inference by dynamically selecting appropriate approximation levels per prompt, balancing quality and throughput requirements effectively.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have gained significant popularity. Most of these are diffusion models with unique computational characteristics, distinct from both traditional small-scale ML models and large language models. They are highly compute-bound and use an iterative denoising process to generate images, leading to very high inference time. This creates significant challenges in designing a high-throughput system. We discovered that a large fraction of prompts can be served using faster, approximated models. However, the approximation setting must be carefully calibrated for each prompt to avoid quality degradation. Designing a high-throughput system that assigns each prompt to the appropriate model and compatible approximation setting remains a challenging problem. We present Argus, a high-throughput T2I inference system that selects the right level of approximation for each prompt to maintain quality while meeting throughput targets on a fixed-size cluster. Argus intelligently switches between different approximation strategies to satisfy both throughput and quality requirements. Overall, Argus achieves 10x fewer latency service-level objective (SLO) violations, 10% higher average quality, and 40% higher throughput compared to baselines on two real-world workload traces.

Conclusion: The dataset and method provide a foundation for future research on multi-view image deraining and rainy 3D scene reconstruction, addressing key limitations in current approaches.

Abstract: Rain degrades the visual quality of multi-view images, which are essential for 3D scene reconstruction, resulting in inaccurate and incomplete reconstruction results. Existing datasets often overlook two critical characteristics of real rainy 3D scenes: the viewpoint-dependent variation in the appearance of rain streaks caused by their projection onto 2D images, and the reduction in ambient brightness resulting from cloud coverage during rainfall. To improve data realism, we construct a new dataset named OmniRain3D that incorporates perspective heterogeneity and brightness dynamicity, enabling more faithful simulation of rain degradation in 3D scenes. Based on this dataset, we propose an end-to-end reconstruction framework named REVR-GSNet (Rain Elimination and Visibility Recovery for 3D Gaussian Splatting). Specifically, REVR-GSNet integrates recursive brightness enhancement, Gaussian primitive optimization, and GS-guided rain elimination into a unified architecture through joint alternating optimization, achieving high-fidelity reconstruction of clean 3D scenes from rain-degraded inputs. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our dataset and method. Our dataset and method provide a foundation for future research on multi-view image deraining and rainy 3D scene reconstruction.

TL;DR: Otter is a novel framework for wide-angle few-shot action recognition that addresses background distractions and temporal relation degradation through compound segmentation and temporal reconstruction modules integrated with RWKV architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wide-angle videos in few-shot action recognition suffer from background distractions that obscure subjects and degraded temporal relations due to frames with similar backgrounds, making action recognition challenging.

Method: Proposes Otter framework with Compound Segmentation Module (CSM) to segment and emphasize key patches highlighting subjects, and Temporal Reconstruction Module (TRM) for bidirectional scanning to reconstruct temporal relations. Combines regular and temporal-enhanced prototypes.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on SSv2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51 benchmarks. Superior performance validated on VideoBadminton dataset for wide-angle FSAR.

Conclusion: Otter effectively addresses background distractions and temporal relation degradation in wide-angle few-shot action recognition through compound segmentation and temporal reconstruction, demonstrating superior performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Wide-angle videos in few-shot action recognition (FSAR) effectively express actions within specific scenarios. However, without a global understanding of both subjects and background, recognizing actions in such samples remains challenging because of the background distractions. Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), which learns interaction between various dimensions, shows promise for global modeling. While directly applying RWKV to wide-angle FSAR may fail to highlight subjects due to excessive background information. Additionally, temporal relation degraded by frames with similar backgrounds is difficult to reconstruct, further impacting performance. Therefore, we design the CompOund SegmenTation and Temporal REconstructing RWKV (Otter). Specifically, the Compound Segmentation Module~(CSM) is devised to segment and emphasize key patches in each frame, effectively highlighting subjects against background information. The Temporal Reconstruction Module (TRM) is incorporated into the temporal-enhanced prototype construction to enable bidirectional scanning, allowing better reconstruct temporal relation. Furthermore, a regular prototype is combined with the temporal-enhanced prototype to simultaneously enhance subject emphasis and temporal modeling, improving wide-angle FSAR performance. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as SSv2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51 demonstrate that Otter achieves state-of-the-art performance. Extra evaluation on the VideoBadminton dataset further validates the superiority of Otter in wide-angle FSAR.

*Ji Li,Chao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Plug-and-Play (PnP) framework that integrates flow matching generative models with primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) optimization to handle various data fidelity terms beyond traditional squared ℓ₂ loss, enabling robust image restoration under non-Gaussian noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PnP methods primarily work well with smooth squared ℓ₂ data fidelity for Gaussian noise, but their applicability to more general data fidelity terms for non-Gaussian noise types remains limited. The authors aim to develop a more versatile PnP approach that can handle diverse noise distributions.

Method: The authors incorporate flow matching generative priors into a PnP framework using proximal splitting, where the proximal operator is replaced by a time-dependent denoiser from the generative model. They propose a general PnP algorithm inspired by PDHG that supports both ℓ₁ and ℓ₂ norm-based losses.

Result: The method is validated on multiple image restoration tasks including denoising, super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting. Results show that ℓ₁ and ℓ₂ fidelity terms outperform conventional squared ℓ₂ loss in the presence of non-Gaussian noise like Poisson and impulse noise.

Conclusion: The proposed PnP-PDHG framework provides a computationally efficient and memory-friendly solution that accommodates a wide range of fidelity terms, making it robust to various non-Gaussian noise types while leveraging powerful generative priors for improved image restoration performance.

Abstract: Regularized optimization has been a classical approach to solving imaging inverse problems, where the regularization term enforces desirable properties of the unknown image. Recently, the integration of flow matching generative models into image restoration has garnered significant attention, owing to their powerful prior modeling capabilities. In this work, we incorporate such generative priors into a Plug-and-Play (PnP) framework based on proximal splitting, where the proximal operator associated with the regularizer is replaced by a time-dependent denoiser derived from the generative model. While existing PnP methods have achieved notable success in inverse problems with smooth squared $\ell_2$ data fidelity--typically associated with Gaussian noise--their applicability to more general data fidelity terms remains underexplored. To address this, we propose a general and efficient PnP algorithm inspired by the primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method. Our approach is computationally efficient, memory-friendly, and accommodates a wide range of fidelity terms. In particular, it supports both $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ norm-based losses, enabling robustness to non-Gaussian noise types such as Poisson and impulse noise. We validate our method on several image restoration tasks, including denoising, super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting, and demonstrate that $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ fidelity terms outperform the conventional squared $\ell_2$ loss in the presence of non-Gaussian noise.

Conclusion: This is the first work to address symptom-to-organ reasoning in medical multimodal learning, successfully overcoming limitations of existing approaches through innovative soft labeling and 2D-3D fusion techniques.

Abstract: Understanding symptom-image associations is crucial for clinical reasoning. However, existing medical multimodal models often rely on simple one-to-one hard labeling, oversimplifying clinical reality where symptoms relate to multiple organs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel network using decoupled HSV Look-Up Tables (LUTs) to address purple flare artifacts in images, featuring a two-stage architecture with Chroma-Aware Spectral Tokenizer and dynamic LUT generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Purple flare artifacts degrade image quality, existing methods lack flexibility due to hand-crafted features, and deep learning is hampered by scarcity of paired training data.

Method: Two-stage architecture: 1) CAST converts RGB to HSV and encodes H/V channels into semantic tokens; 2) HSV-LUT module generates independent correction curves (1D-LUTs) for H, S, V channels using these tokens.

Result: Model significantly outperforms existing methods in visual effects and achieves state-of-the-art performance on all quantitative metrics. Built first large-scale purple flare dataset with diverse scenes.

Conclusion: The proposed decoupled HSV LUT approach effectively resolves color coupling problems and provides superior purple flare correction compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Purple flare, a diffuse chromatic aberration artifact commonly found around highlight areas, severely degrades the tone transition and color of the image. Existing traditional methods are based on hand-crafted features, which lack flexibility and rely entirely on fixed priors, while the scarcity of paired training data critically hampers deep learning. To address this issue, we propose a novel network built upon decoupled HSV Look-Up Tables (LUTs). The method aims to simplify color correction by adjusting the Hue (H), Saturation (S), and Value (V) components independently. This approach resolves the inherent color coupling problems in traditional methods. Our model adopts a two-stage architecture: First, a Chroma-Aware Spectral Tokenizer (CAST) converts the input image from RGB space to HSV space and independently encodes the Hue (H) and Value (V) channels into a set of semantic tokens describing the Purple flare status; second, the HSV-LUT module takes these tokens as input and dynamically generates independent correction curves (1D-LUTs) for the three channels H, S, and V. To effectively train and validate our model, we built the first large-scale purple flare dataset with diverse scenes. We also proposed new metrics and a loss function specifically designed for this task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model not only significantly outperforms existing methods in visual effects but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on all quantitative metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper improves 3D Gaussian Splatting for large outdoor scenes with weak/repetitive textures by using LiDAR-IMU odometry for robust pose estimation and adding normal vector constraints with rank regularization for better scene representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address unstable pose estimation and scene representation distortion caused by geometric texture inconsistency in large outdoor scenes with weak or repetitive textures.

Method: Uses LiDAR-IMU Odometry for prior poses in pose estimation, and introduces normal vector constraints with effective rank regularization for Gaussian primitive consistency in scene representation.

Result: Method requires only one-third of the time for pose optimization while maintaining accuracy, and significantly outperforms conventional 3DGS pipelines in scene representation, especially on weak/repetitive texture datasets.

Conclusion: The approach enhances visualization capabilities and achieves superior overall performance in challenging outdoor environments with texture issues.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a key rendering pipeline for digital asset creation due to its balance between efficiency and visual quality. To address the issues of unstable pose estimation and scene representation distortion caused by geometric texture inconsistency in large outdoor scenes with weak or repetitive textures, we approach the problem from two aspects: pose estimation and scene representation. For pose estimation, we leverage LiDAR-IMU Odometry to provide prior poses for cameras in large-scale environments. These prior pose constraints are incorporated into COLMAP's triangulation process, with pose optimization performed via bundle adjustment. Ensuring consistency between pixel data association and prior poses helps maintain both robustness and accuracy. For scene representation, we introduce normal vector constraints and effective rank regularization to enforce consistency in the direction and shape of Gaussian primitives. These constraints are jointly optimized with the existing photometric loss to enhance the map quality. We evaluate our approach using both public and self-collected datasets. In terms of pose optimization, our method requires only one-third of the time while maintaining accuracy and robustness across both datasets. In terms of scene representation, the results show that our method significantly outperforms conventional 3DGS pipelines. Notably, on self-collected datasets characterized by weak or repetitive textures, our approach demonstrates enhanced visualization capabilities and achieves superior overall performance. Codes and data will be publicly available at https://github.com/justinyeah/normal_shape.git.

*Bartłomiej Baranowski,Stefano Esposito,Patricia Gschoßmann,Anpei Chen,Andreas Geiger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ConeGS improves 3D Gaussian Splatting by using image-space-informed densification with depth estimation from iNGP proxy, enabling better Gaussian placement and reducing primitive count while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS suffers from suboptimal spatial distribution of primitives due to cloning-based densification that propagates Gaussians along existing geometry, limiting exploration and requiring many primitives.

Method: Creates iNGP reconstruction as geometric proxy for depth estimation, identifies high-error pixels, inserts new Gaussians along viewing cones at predicted depths, uses opacity penalty to remove redundant Gaussians, and implements primitive budgeting.

Result: Consistently enhances reconstruction quality and rendering performance across Gaussian budgets, with strong gains under tight primitive constraints.

Conclusion: ConeGS provides an effective framework for improving 3DGS by enabling more efficient Gaussian placement independent of existing scene geometry.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves state-of-the-art image quality and real-time performance in novel view synthesis but often suffers from a suboptimal spatial distribution of primitives. This issue stems from cloning-based densification, which propagates Gaussians along existing geometry, limiting exploration and requiring many primitives to adequately cover the scene. We present ConeGS, an image-space-informed densification framework that is independent of existing scene geometry state. ConeGS first creates a fast Instant Neural Graphics Primitives (iNGP) reconstruction as a geometric proxy to estimate per-pixel depth. During the subsequent 3DGS optimization, it identifies high-error pixels and inserts new Gaussians along the corresponding viewing cones at the predicted depth values, initializing their size according to the cone diameter. A pre-activation opacity penalty rapidly removes redundant Gaussians, while a primitive budgeting strategy controls the total number of primitives, either by a fixed budget or by adapting to scene complexity, ensuring high reconstruction quality. Experiments show that ConeGS consistently enhances reconstruction quality and rendering performance across Gaussian budgets, with especially strong gains under tight primitive constraints where efficient placement is crucial.

### [174] [Integrating Reweighted Least Squares with Plug-and-Play Diffusion Priors for Noisy Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06823)
*Ji Li,Chao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A plug-and-play image restoration framework using generative diffusion priors for robust removal of general noise types, including impulse noise, with a generalized Gaussian scale mixture-based loss function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods mainly focus on Gaussian noise and use conventional denoisers, while the application of generative priors to non-Gaussian noise like impulse noise remains unexplored.

Method: Uses generative diffusion priors within MAP framework with generalized Gaussian scale mixture-based loss (ℓ_q-norm fidelity term) and solves via iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) with diffusion-based denoiser proximal steps.

Result: Effectively removes non-Gaussian impulse noise and achieves superior restoration performance on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully extends plug-and-play methods to handle various noise types beyond Gaussian noise using generative diffusion priors.

Abstract: Existing plug-and-play image restoration methods typically employ off-the-shelf Gaussian denoisers as proximal operators within classical optimization frameworks based on variable splitting. Recently, denoisers induced by generative priors have been successfully integrated into regularized optimization methods for image restoration under Gaussian noise. However, their application to non-Gaussian noise--such as impulse noise--remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play image restoration framework based on generative diffusion priors for robust removal of general noise types, including impulse noise. Within the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation framework, the data fidelity term is adapted to the specific noise model. Departing from the conventional least-squares loss used for Gaussian noise, we introduce a generalized Gaussian scale mixture-based loss, which approximates a wide range of noise distributions and leads to an $\ell_q$-norm ($0<q\leq2$) fidelity term. This optimization problem is addressed using an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) approach, wherein the proximal step involving the generative prior is efficiently performed via a diffusion-based denoiser. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method effectively removes non-Gaussian impulse noise and achieves superior restoration performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As Gaussian Splatting variants proliferate, there's a need to assess perceptual quality of 3D object reconstructions, which remains an open challenge in the field.

Method: Developed a unified multi-distance subjective quality assessment method that mimics human viewing behavior, and constructed MUGSQA dataset considering multiple input uncertainties (quantity/resolution of views, view distance, point cloud accuracy).

Result: Created two benchmarks: one for evaluating robustness of GS-based reconstruction methods under uncertainties, and another for assessing performance of existing quality metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed assessment method and MUGSQA dataset provide comprehensive tools for evaluating GS-based 3D reconstruction quality, with dataset and benchmark code to be released publicly.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) has recently emerged as a promising technique for 3D object reconstruction, delivering high-quality rendering results with significantly improved reconstruction speed. As variants continue to appear, assessing the perceptual quality of 3D objects reconstructed with different GS-based methods remains an open challenge. To address this issue, we first propose a unified multi-distance subjective quality assessment method that closely mimics human viewing behavior for objects reconstructed with GS-based methods in actual applications, thereby better collecting perceptual experiences. Based on it, we also construct a novel GS quality assessment dataset named MUGSQA, which is constructed considering multiple uncertainties of the input data. These uncertainties include the quantity and resolution of input views, the view distance, and the accuracy of the initial point cloud. Moreover, we construct two benchmarks: one to evaluate the robustness of various GS-based reconstruction methods under multiple uncertainties, and the other to evaluate the performance of existing quality assessment metrics. Our dataset and benchmark code will be released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video diffusion models for audio-driven portrait animation suffer from flickering, identity drift, and poor audio-visual synchronization due to entangled appearance-motion representations and unstable inference strategies.

Method: 1) Optical flow-guided temporal module (OFT) decouples motion from appearance using facial optical flow; 2) Audio-to-Intensity (A2I) model transforms audio and facial velocity into frame-wise intensity sequences; 3) Diffusion noise initialization strategy (IC-Init) with constraints on background coherence and motion continuity.

Result: Extensive experiments show ConsistTalk significantly outperforms prior methods in reducing flicker, preserving identity, and delivering temporally stable, high-fidelity talking head videos.

Conclusion: ConsistTalk achieves superior temporal consistency, identity preservation, and audio-visual synchronization through its decoupled motion modeling and constrained inference strategy.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video diffusion models have significantly enhanced audio-driven portrait animation. However, current methods still suffer from flickering, identity drift, and poor audio-visual synchronization. These issues primarily stem from entangled appearance-motion representations and unstable inference strategies. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{ConsistTalk}, a novel intensity-controllable and temporally consistent talking head generation framework with diffusion noise search inference. First, we propose \textbf{an optical flow-guided temporal module (OFT)} that decouples motion features from static appearance by leveraging facial optical flow, thereby reducing visual flicker and improving temporal consistency. Second, we present an \textbf{Audio-to-Intensity (A2I) model} obtained through multimodal teacher-student knowledge distillation. By transforming audio and facial velocity features into a frame-wise intensity sequence, the A2I model enables joint modeling of audio and visual motion, resulting in more natural dynamics. This further enables fine-grained, frame-wise control of motion dynamics while maintaining tight audio-visual synchronization. Third, we introduce a \textbf{diffusion noise initialization strategy (IC-Init)}. By enforcing explicit constraints on background coherence and motion continuity during inference-time noise search, we achieve better identity preservation and refine motion dynamics compared to the current autoregressive strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConsistTalk significantly outperforms prior methods in reducing flicker, preserving identity, and delivering temporally stable, high-fidelity talking head videos.

TL;DR: Feature-based knowledge distillation works well for CNNs but fails with Vision Transformers (ViTs), performing worse than simple logit distillation due to representational mismatch between teacher and student models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why feature-based knowledge distillation techniques that work effectively for CNNs unexpectedly fail when applied to Vision Transformers, and to identify the root causes of this negative transfer phenomenon.

Method: Developed a novel analytical framework called "distillation dynamics" combining frequency spectrum analysis, information entropy metrics, and activation magnitude tracking to analyze ViT behavior during distillation.

Result: Revealed that ViTs exhibit a U-shaped information processing pattern (initial compression followed by expansion) and identified that teacher models use distributed high-dimensional encoding in later layers that smaller student models cannot replicate due to limited channel capacity, causing feature alignment to harm performance.

Conclusion: Successful knowledge transfer in ViTs requires moving beyond naive feature mimicry to methods that respect fundamental representational constraints, providing essential theoretical guidance for designing effective ViT compression strategies.

Abstract: While feature-based knowledge distillation has proven highly effective for compressing CNNs, these techniques unexpectedly fail when applied to Vision Transformers (ViTs), often performing worse than simple logit-based distillation. We provide the first comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon through a novel analytical framework termed as ``distillation dynamics", combining frequency spectrum analysis, information entropy metrics, and activation magnitude tracking. Our investigation reveals that ViTs exhibit a distinctive U-shaped information processing pattern: initial compression followed by expansion. We identify the root cause of negative transfer in feature distillation: a fundamental representational paradigm mismatch between teacher and student models. Through frequency-domain analysis, we show that teacher models employ distributed, high-dimensional encoding strategies in later layers that smaller student models cannot replicate due to limited channel capacity. This mismatch causes late-layer feature alignment to actively harm student performance. Our findings reveal that successful knowledge transfer in ViTs requires moving beyond naive feature mimicry to methods that respect these fundamental representational constraints, providing essential theoretical guidance for designing effective ViTs compression strategies.

Motivation: Address the challenge of simultaneously enhancing accuracy and diversity in ambiguous medical image segmentation, where existing truncated diffusion probabilistic models suffer from entangled accuracy-diversity trade-offs with insufficient fidelity and plausibility.

Method: Proposes three key components: 1) Data-Hierarchical Inference for disentangling accuracy and diversity at different levels, 2) Gaussian Truncation Representation to enhance fidelity and truncation reliability, 3) Segmentation Flow Matching to improve plausibility of diverse predictions.

Result: Outperforms SOTA methods on LIDC and ISIC3 datasets, improving GED by up to 12% and HM-IoU by up to 7.3% while achieving more efficient inference.

Conclusion: ATFM successfully addresses the accuracy-diversity trade-off in ambiguous medical image segmentation through its novel inference paradigm and dedicated components, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: A simultaneous enhancement of accuracy and diversity of predictions remains a challenge in ambiguous medical image segmentation (AMIS) due to the inherent trade-offs. While truncated diffusion probabilistic models (TDPMs) hold strong potential with a paradigm optimization, existing TDPMs suffer from entangled accuracy and diversity of predictions with insufficient fidelity and plausibility. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose Ambiguity-aware Truncated Flow Matching (ATFM), which introduces a novel inference paradigm and dedicated model components. Firstly, we propose Data-Hierarchical Inference, a redefinition of AMIS-specific inference paradigm, which enhances accuracy and diversity at data-distribution and data-sample level, respectively, for an effective disentanglement. Secondly, Gaussian Truncation Representation (GTR) is introduced to enhance both fidelity of predictions and reliability of truncation distribution, by explicitly modeling it as a Gaussian distribution at $T_{\text{trunc}}$ instead of using sampling-based approximations.Thirdly, Segmentation Flow Matching (SFM) is proposed to enhance the plausibility of diverse predictions by extending semantic-aware flow transformation in Flow Matching (FM). Comprehensive evaluations on LIDC and ISIC3 datasets demonstrate that ATFM outperforms SOTA methods and simultaneously achieves a more efficient inference. ATFM improves GED and HM-IoU by up to $12\%$ and $7.3\%$ compared to advanced methods.

TL;DR: VAEVQ improves vector quantization by using VAE for smoother latent spaces, adaptive alignment between pre/post-quantization features, and distribution consistency regularization to address codebook underutilization and improve generation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional VQ-based frameworks suffer from non-smooth latent spaces, weak alignment between representations before/after quantization, and poor coherence between continuous/discrete domains, leading to unstable codeword learning and underutilized codebooks.

Method: Three components: (1) Variational Latent Quantization (VLQ) using VAE instead of AE for structured latent space, (2) Representation Coherence Strategy (RCS) for adaptive alignment modulation, (3) Distribution Consistency Regularization (DCR) for codebook-continuous distribution alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show VAEVQ outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both reconstruction and downstream generation tasks.

Conclusion: VAEVQ effectively addresses VQ limitations through variational modeling, adaptive alignment, and distribution regularization, achieving superior performance in image representation learning and generation.

Abstract: Vector quantization (VQ) transforms continuous image features into discrete representations, providing compressed, tokenized inputs for generative models. However, VQ-based frameworks suffer from several issues, such as non-smooth latent spaces, weak alignment between representations before and after quantization, and poor coherence between the continuous and discrete domains. These issues lead to unstable codeword learning and underutilized codebooks, ultimately degrading the performance of both reconstruction and downstream generation tasks. To this end, we propose VAEVQ, which comprises three key components: (1) Variational Latent Quantization (VLQ), replacing the AE with a VAE for quantization to leverage its structured and smooth latent space, thereby facilitating more effective codeword activation; (2) Representation Coherence Strategy (RCS), adaptively modulating the alignment strength between pre- and post-quantization features to enhance consistency and prevent overfitting to noise; and (3) Distribution Consistency Regularization (DCR), aligning the entire codebook distribution with the continuous latent distribution to improve utilization. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that VAEVQ outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Result: FIBO achieves state-of-the-art prompt alignment among open-source models, demonstrating improved controllability and expressiveness.

Conclusion: Training on long structured captions with fine-grained attributes enables better disentangled control over visual factors and addresses the controllability limitations of current text-to-image models.

Abstract: Text-to-image models have rapidly evolved from casual creative tools to professional-grade systems, achieving unprecedented levels of image quality and realism. Yet, most models are trained to map short prompts into detailed images, creating a gap between sparse textual input and rich visual outputs. This mismatch reduces controllability, as models often fill in missing details arbitrarily, biasing toward average user preferences and limiting precision for professional use. We address this limitation by training the first open-source text-to-image model on long structured captions, where every training sample is annotated with the same set of fine-grained attributes. This design maximizes expressive coverage and enables disentangled control over visual factors. To process long captions efficiently, we propose DimFusion, a fusion mechanism that integrates intermediate tokens from a lightweight LLM without increasing token length. We also introduce the Text-as-a-Bottleneck Reconstruction (TaBR) evaluation protocol. By assessing how well real images can be reconstructed through a captioning-generation loop, TaBR directly measures controllability and expressiveness, even for very long captions where existing evaluation methods fail. Finally, we demonstrate our contributions by training the large-scale model FIBO, achieving state-of-the-art prompt alignment among open-source models.

*Jan-Hendrik Koch,Jonas Krumme,Konrad Gadzicki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage system using LLM for layout generation and layout-conditioned diffusion models for image synthesis achieves precise control over object counts and spatial arrangements in text-to-image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models lack precise control over object counts and spatial arrangements, limiting their compositional capabilities for complex scenes.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) LLM generates structured layout from object list, 2) Layout-conditioned diffusion model synthesizes image. Task decomposition with rule-based insertion improves object recall. Compared ControlNet vs GLIGEN conditioning methods after domain-specific finetuning.

Result: Task decomposition improved object recall from 57.2% to 99.9% for complex scenes. ControlNet preserves text-based stylistic control but suffers object hallucination, while GLIGEN provides superior layout fidelity with reduced prompt controllability. System successfully generates images with specified object counts and plausible spatial arrangements.

Conclusion: Decoupled approach using LLM for spatial planning and layout-conditioned diffusion for synthesis is viable for compositionally controlled image generation, with trade-offs between layout fidelity and prompt-based controllability depending on conditioning method.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models exhibit remarkable generative capabilities, but lack precise control over object counts and spatial arrangements. This work introduces a two-stage system to address these compositional limitations. The first stage employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate a structured layout from a list of objects. The second stage uses a layout-conditioned diffusion model to synthesize a photorealistic image adhering to this layout. We find that task decomposition is critical for LLM-based spatial planning; by simplifying the initial generation to core objects and completing the layout with rule-based insertion, we improve object recall from 57.2% to 99.9% for complex scenes. For image synthesis, we compare two leading conditioning methods: ControlNet and GLIGEN. After domain-specific finetuning on table-setting datasets, we identify a key trade-off: ControlNet preserves text-based stylistic control but suffers from object hallucination, while GLIGEN provides superior layout fidelity at the cost of reduced prompt-based controllability. Our end-to-end system successfully generates images with specified object counts and plausible spatial arrangements, demonstrating the viability of a decoupled approach for compositionally controlled synthesis.

TL;DR: Proposes MPT, a novel Transformer architecture with adaptive morphology-aware patches and semantic clustering attention for improved aortic vascular segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Transformer models use fixed rectangular patches that damage complex vascular structure integrity, leading to suboptimal segmentation accuracy.

Method: Adaptive Morph Patch Transformer (MPT) with morphology-aware patch partitioning and Semantic Clustering Attention (SCA) to aggregate features from semantically similar patches.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three datasets (AVT, AortaSeg24, TBAD) with improved segmentation of intricate vascular structures.

Conclusion: MPT effectively addresses limitations of traditional Transformers by preserving vascular structure integrity through adaptive patches and semantic feature aggregation.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of aortic vascular structures is critical for diagnosing and treating cardiovascular diseases.Traditional Transformer-based models have shown promise in this domain by capturing long-range dependencies between vascular features. However, their reliance on fixed-size rectangular patches often influences the integrity of complex vascular structures, leading to suboptimal segmentation accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose the adaptive Morph Patch Transformer (MPT), a novel architecture specifically designed for aortic vascular segmentation. Specifically, MPT introduces an adaptive patch partitioning strategy that dynamically generates morphology-aware patches aligned with complex vascular structures. This strategy can preserve semantic integrity of complex vascular structures within individual patches. Moreover, a Semantic Clustering Attention (SCA) method is proposed to dynamically aggregate features from various patches with similar semantic characteristics. This method enhances the model's capability to segment vessels of varying sizes, preserving the integrity of vascular structures. Extensive experiments on three open-source dataset(AVT, AortaSeg24 and TBAD) demonstrate that MPT achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improvements in segmenting intricate vascular structures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel reflection-based method using polarized light scattering and CNN classification achieves 80% accuracy for identifying microplastics in water, with AOLP signals being more robust than DOLP for distinguishing polyethylene types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the critical need for continuous, large-scale microplastic monitoring in aquatic environments, overcoming limitations of gold-standard methods and transmission-based interference issues.

Method: Use polarized laser light illumination and polarization-sensitive camera to capture reflected signals from microplastics, then apply deep convolutional neural network for image-based classification of polymer types.

Result: Achieved 80% mean classification accuracy for three polymer types (HDPE, LDPE, PP); AOLP signals showed superior robustness and better distinction between polyethylene types, while DOLP excelled at identifying polypropylene.

Conclusion: Reflection-based polarized light scattering with CNN classification is effective for in-situ microplastic identification, with AOLP and DOLP signals providing complementary strengths for different polymer discrimination tasks.

Abstract: Facing the critical need for continuous, large-scale microplastic monitoring, which is hindered by the limitations of gold-standard methods in aquatic environments, this paper introduces and validates a novel, reflection-based approach for the in-situ classification and identification of microplastics directly in water bodies, which is based on polarized light scattering. In this experiment, we classify colorless microplastic particles (50-300 $μ$m) by illuminating them with linearly polarized laser light and capturing their reflected signals using a polarization-sensitive camera. This reflection-based technique successfully circumvents the transmission-based interference issues that plague many conventional methods when applied in water. Using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for image-based classification, we successfully identified three common polymer types, high-density polyethylene, low-density polyethylene, and polypropylene, achieving a peak mean classification accuracy of 80% on the test dataset. A subsequent feature hierarchy analysis demonstrated that the CNN's decision-making process relies mainly on the microstructural integrity and internal texture (polarization patterns) of the particle rather than its macroshape. Critically, we found that the Angle of Linear Polarization (AOLP) signal is significantly more robust against contextual noise than the Degree of Linear Polarization (DOLP) signal. While the AOLP-based classification achieved superior overall performance, its strength lies in distinguishing between the two polyethylene plastics, showing a lower confusion rate between high-density and low-density polyethylene. Conversely, the DOLP signal demonstrated slightly worse overall classification results but excels at accurately identifying the polypropylene class, which it isolated with greater success than AOLP.

TL;DR: Mono3DVG-EnSD is a novel framework for monocular 3D visual grounding that addresses over-reliance on high-certainty keywords and cross-dimensional interference through CLIP-LCA and D2M modules, achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods over-rely on high-certainty keywords while neglecting spatial descriptions, and suffer from cross-dimensional interference between 2D and 3D features in cross-modal interactions.

Method: Proposes two key components: CLIP-Guided Lexical Certainty Adapter (CLIP-LCA) that masks high-certainty keywords to force spatial understanding, and Dimension-Decoupled Module (D2M) that decouples dimension-specific textual features to guide corresponding visual features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Mono3DRefer dataset across all metrics, with significant +13.54% improvement in challenging Far(Acc@0.5) scenario.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses key limitations in monocular 3D visual grounding by improving spatial understanding and mitigating cross-dimensional interference, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Monocular 3D Visual Grounding (Mono3DVG) is an emerging task that locates 3D objects in RGB images using text descriptions with geometric cues. However, existing methods face two key limitations. Firstly, they often over-rely on high-certainty keywords that explicitly identify the target object while neglecting critical spatial descriptions. Secondly, generalized textual features contain both 2D and 3D descriptive information, thereby capturing an additional dimension of details compared to singular 2D or 3D visual features. This characteristic leads to cross-dimensional interference when refining visual features under text guidance. To overcome these challenges, we propose Mono3DVG-EnSD, a novel framework that integrates two key components: the CLIP-Guided Lexical Certainty Adapter (CLIP-LCA) and the Dimension-Decoupled Module (D2M). The CLIP-LCA dynamically masks high-certainty keywords while retaining low-certainty implicit spatial descriptions, thereby forcing the model to develop a deeper understanding of spatial relationships in captions for object localization. Meanwhile, the D2M decouples dimension-specific (2D/3D) textual features from generalized textual features to guide corresponding visual features at same dimension, which mitigates cross-dimensional interference by ensuring dimensionally-consistent cross-modal interactions. Through comprehensive comparisons and ablation studies on the Mono3DRefer dataset, our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across all metrics. Notably, it improves the challenging Far(Acc@0.5) scenario by a significant +13.54%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address two key challenges in video shadow detection: shadow-background ambiguity in complex scenes and dynamic shadow deformation under varying illumination conditions.

Method: Uses Vision-language Match Module (VMM) and Dark-aware Semantic Block (DSB) for text-guided feature extraction, adaptive mask reweighting for penumbra regions, and Tokenized Temporal Block (TTB) for efficient spatiotemporal modeling via temporal tokens.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on multiple benchmark datasets with real-time inference efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed DTTNet effectively handles shadow-background ambiguity and dynamic shadow deformations through vision-language matching and efficient temporal modeling, demonstrating superior performance and practical efficiency.

Abstract: Video shadow detection confronts two entwined difficulties: distinguishing shadows from complex backgrounds and modeling dynamic shadow deformations under varying illumination. To address shadow-background ambiguity, we leverage linguistic priors through the proposed Vision-language Match Module (VMM) and a Dark-aware Semantic Block (DSB), extracting text-guided features to explicitly differentiate shadows from dark objects. Furthermore, we introduce adaptive mask reweighting to downweight penumbra regions during training and apply edge masks at the final decoder stage for better supervision. For temporal modeling of variable shadow shapes, we propose a Tokenized Temporal Block (TTB) that decouples spatiotemporal learning. TTB summarizes cross-frame shadow semantics into learnable temporal tokens, enabling efficient sequence encoding with minimal computation overhead. Comprehensive Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time inference efficiency. Codes are available at https://github.com/city-cheng/DTTNet.

TL;DR: PADM is a diffusion-based generative model that corrects attenuation artifacts in cardiac SPECT imaging using only non-attenuation-corrected input, eliminating the need for expensive CT systems while maintaining physics-informed supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Attenuation artifacts in cardiac SPECT MPI compromise diagnostic accuracy. While hybrid SPECT/CT systems help, their high cost, limited accessibility, and added radiation exposure limit clinical adoption.

Method: Physics-aware Attenuation Correction Diffusion Model (PADM) incorporates explicit physics priors via teacher-student distillation, enabling attenuation correction using only NAC input while benefiting from physics-informed supervision during training.

Result: PADM outperforms state-of-the-art generative models, delivering superior reconstruction fidelity across both quantitative metrics and visual assessment.

Conclusion: PADM provides an effective CT-free solution for attenuation correction in cardiac SPECT, offering comparable performance to CT-based methods without the associated costs and radiation exposure.

Abstract: Attenuation artifacts remain a significant challenge in cardiac Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (MPI) using Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT), often compromising diagnostic accuracy and reducing clinical interpretability. While hybrid SPECT/CT systems mitigate these artifacts through CT-derived attenuation maps, their high cost, limited accessibility, and added radiation exposure hinder widespread clinical adoption. In this study, we propose a novel CT-free solution to attenuation correction in cardiac SPECT. Specifically, we introduce Physics-aware Attenuation Correction Diffusion Model (PADM), a diffusion-based generative method that incorporates explicit physics priors via a teacher--student distillation mechanism. This approach enables attenuation artifact correction using only Non-Attenuation-Corrected (NAC) input, while still benefiting from physics-informed supervision during training. To support this work, we also introduce CardiAC, a comprehensive dataset comprising 424 patient studies with paired NAC and Attenuation-Corrected (AC) reconstructions, alongside high-resolution CT-based attenuation maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PADM outperforms state-of-the-art generative models, delivering superior reconstruction fidelity across both quantitative metrics and visual assessment.

Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) shows promise for video compression but suffers from noticeable visual artifacts and low compression ratios in existing implementations.

Method: Proposes GFix framework with: 1) Single-step diffusion model as neural enhancer to treat artifacts as noisy latents, 2) Modulated LoRA scheme that freezes low-rank decompositions and modulates hidden states for efficient adaptation with compressible updates.

Result: GFix achieves strong perceptual quality enhancement, outperforming GSVC with up to 72.1% BD-rate savings in LPIPS and 21.4% in FID.

Conclusion: The proposed GFix framework effectively enhances 3DGS-based video compression by leveraging diffusion models and efficient adaptation techniques, achieving significant improvements in perceptual quality and compression efficiency.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enhances 3D scene reconstruction through explicit representation and fast rendering, demonstrating potential benefits for various low-level vision tasks, including video compression. However, existing 3DGS-based video codecs generally exhibit more noticeable visual artifacts and relatively low compression ratios. In this paper, we specifically target the perceptual enhancement of 3DGS-based video compression, based on the assumption that artifacts from 3DGS rendering and quantization resemble noisy latents sampled during diffusion training. Building on this premise, we propose a content-adaptive framework, GFix, comprising a streamlined, single-step diffusion model that serves as an off-the-shelf neural enhancer. Moreover, to increase compression efficiency, We propose a modulated LoRA scheme that freezes the low-rank decompositions and modulates the intermediate hidden states, thereby achieving efficient adaptation of the diffusion backbone with highly compressible updates. Experimental results show that GFix delivers strong perceptual quality enhancement, outperforming GSVC with up to 72.1% BD-rate savings in LPIPS and 21.4% in FID.

Result: Evaluations across multiple cancer datasets (lung, renal, colorectal) show competitive representation quality and downstream classification performance while maintaining efficiency under weak supervision.

Conclusion: WISE-MAE successfully brings structure and biological relevance into MAE-based learning through domain-adapted patch selection, improving learned representations for digital pathology applications.

Abstract: Whole-slide images are central to digital pathology, yet their extreme size and scarce annotations make self-supervised learning essential. Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) with Vision Transformer backbones have recently shown strong potential for histopathology representation learning. However, conventional random patch sampling during MAE pretraining often includes irrelevant or noisy regions, limiting the model's ability to capture meaningful tissue patterns. In this paper, we present a lightweight and domain-adapted framework that brings structure and biological relevance into MAE-based learning through a wavelet-informed patch selection strategy. WISE-MAE applies a two-step coarse-to-fine process: wavelet-based screening at low magnification to locate structurally rich regions, followed by high-resolution extraction for detailed modeling. This approach mirrors the diagnostic workflow of pathologists and improves the quality of learned representations. Evaluations across multiple cancer datasets, including lung, renal, and colorectal tissues, show that WISE-MAE achieves competitive representation quality and downstream classification performance while maintaining efficiency under weak supervision.

Result: Achieves 99.8% AUROC on contemporary deepfakes but shows significant performance decay, with recall dropping over 30% on deepfakes from newer generation techniques just six months later.

Conclusion: Robust detection requires ongoing curation of large, diverse datasets and focuses on static frame-level artifacts rather than temporal inconsistencies, with future effectiveness depending on rapid data collection and advanced frame-level feature detectors.

Abstract: The continually advancing quality of deepfake technology exacerbates the threats of disinformation, fraud, and harassment by making maliciously-generated synthetic content increasingly difficult to distinguish from reality. We introduce a simple yet effective two-stage detection method that achieves an AUROC of over 99.8% on contemporary deepfakes. However, this high performance is short-lived. We show that models trained on this data suffer a recall drop of over 30% when evaluated on deepfakes created with generation techniques from just six months later, demonstrating significant decay as threats evolve. Our analysis reveals two key insights for robust detection. Firstly, continued performance requires the ongoing curation of large, diverse datasets. Second, predictive power comes primarily from static, frame-level artifacts, not temporal inconsistencies. The future of effective deepfake detection therefore depends on rapid data collection and the development of advanced frame-level feature detectors.

TL;DR: FreqCert is a frequency-domain certification framework for 3D point cloud classification that provides certified robustness against L2-bounded perturbations using graph Fourier transform and spectral-based subsampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing certified defenses for point cloud classifiers only handle point-wise perturbations but fail against subtle geometric distortions that preserve individual points while altering overall structure, creating safety risks in autonomous driving and robotics applications.

Method: Transforms input point clouds via graph Fourier transform (GFT), applies frequency-aware subsampling to generate multiple sub-point clouds based on spectral similarity, then uses majority voting of standard model predictions on these sub-clouds.

Result: Achieves higher certified accuracy and empirical accuracy under strong perturbations on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN datasets compared to existing methods, with proven tightness of certified L2 robustness radius.

Conclusion: Spectral representations provide an effective pathway for certifiable robustness in 3D point cloud recognition, offering better alignment with object structure and stability under perturbations.

Abstract: 3D point cloud classification is a fundamental task in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. However, recent studies reveal that point cloud classifiers are vulnerable to structured adversarial perturbations and geometric corruptions, posing risks to their deployment in safety-critical scenarios. Existing certified defenses limit point-wise perturbations but overlook subtle geometric distortions that preserve individual points yet alter the overall structure, potentially leading to misclassification. In this work, we propose FreqCert, a novel certification framework that departs from conventional spatial domain defenses by shifting robustness analysis to the frequency domain, enabling structured certification against global L2-bounded perturbations. FreqCert first transforms the input point cloud via the graph Fourier transform (GFT), then applies structured frequency-aware subsampling to generate multiple sub-point clouds. Each sub-cloud is independently classified by a standard model, and the final prediction is obtained through majority voting, where sub-clouds are constructed based on spectral similarity rather than spatial proximity, making the partitioning more stable under L2 perturbations and better aligned with the object's intrinsic structure. We derive a closed-form lower bound on the certified L2 robustness radius and prove its tightness under minimal and interpretable assumptions, establishing a theoretical foundation for frequency domain certification. Extensive experiments on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN datasets demonstrate that FreqCert consistently achieves higher certified accuracy and empirical accuracy under strong perturbations. Our results suggest that spectral representations provide an effective pathway toward certifiable robustness in 3D point cloud recognition.

TL;DR: 3D-ANC is a novel defense approach that uses Neural Collapse mechanism to create disentangled feature spaces, significantly improving 3D point cloud model robustness against adversarial attacks by addressing class imbalance and geometric similarities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks for 3D point cloud recognition are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, and conventional defenses struggle with evolving attack patterns due to entangled feature spaces that make attacks easier.

Method: Combines ETF-aligned classification module with adaptive training framework including representation-balanced learning (RBL) and dynamic feature direction loss (FDL) to leverage Neural Collapse mechanism for creating maximally separable class prototypes.

Result: Significantly improves model robustness - DGCNN's classification accuracy increased from 27.2% to 80.9% on ModelNet40 (53.7% absolute gain), surpassing leading baselines by 34.0% across various model structures on two datasets.

Conclusion: 3D-ANC effectively empowers existing models to develop disentangled feature spaces despite 3D data complexity, providing substantial robustness improvements against adversarial attacks in 3D point cloud recognition.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have recently achieved notable progress in 3D point cloud recognition, yet their vulnerability to adversarial perturbations poses critical security challenges in practical deployments. Conventional defense mechanisms struggle to address the evolving landscape of multifaceted attack patterns. Through systematic analysis of existing defenses, we identify that their unsatisfactory performance primarily originates from an entangled feature space, where adversarial attacks can be performed easily. To this end, we present 3D-ANC, a novel approach that capitalizes on the Neural Collapse (NC) mechanism to orchestrate discriminative feature learning. In particular, NC depicts where last-layer features and classifier weights jointly evolve into a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF) arrangement, establishing maximally separable class prototypes. However, leveraging this advantage in 3D recognition confronts two substantial challenges: (1) prevalent class imbalance in point cloud datasets, and (2) complex geometric similarities between object categories. To tackle these obstacles, our solution combines an ETF-aligned classification module with an adaptive training framework consisting of representation-balanced learning (RBL) and dynamic feature direction loss (FDL). 3D-ANC seamlessly empowers existing models to develop disentangled feature spaces despite the complexity in 3D data distribution. Comprehensive evaluations state that 3D-ANC significantly improves the robustness of models with various structures on two datasets. For instance, DGCNN's classification accuracy is elevated from 27.2% to 80.9% on ModelNet40 -- a 53.7% absolute gain that surpasses leading baselines by 34.0%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The open accessibility of Video Foundation Models introduces critical security risks, as adversaries can exploit full knowledge of VFMs to launch potent attacks against downstream models or Multi-modal Large Language Models fine-tuned from these open-source VFMs.

Method: TVA (Transferable Video Attack) integrates bidirectional contrastive learning to maximize discrepancy between clean and adversarial features, and introduces temporal consistency loss that exploits motion cues to enhance sequential impact of perturbations. It avoids training expensive surrogate models or accessing domain-specific data.

Result: Extensive experiments across 24 video-related tasks demonstrate TVA's efficacy against downstream models and MLLMs, revealing previously underexplored security vulnerabilities in video model deployment.

Conclusion: The research exposes critical security risks in VFM deployment and proposes a practical adversarial attack method that can exploit vulnerabilities directly from foundation models without traditional attack requirements.

Abstract: Large-scale Video Foundation Models (VFMs) has significantly advanced various video-related tasks, either through task-specific models or Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, the open accessibility of VFMs also introduces critical security risks, as adversaries can exploit full knowledge of the VFMs to launch potent attacks. This paper investigates a novel and practical adversarial threat scenario: attacking downstream models or MLLMs fine-tuned from open-source VFMs, without requiring access to the victim task, training data, model query, and architecture. In contrast to conventional transfer-based attacks that rely on task-aligned surrogate models, we demonstrate that adversarial vulnerabilities can be exploited directly from the VFMs. To this end, we propose the Transferable Video Attack (TVA), a temporal-aware adversarial attack method that leverages the temporal representation dynamics of VFMs to craft effective perturbations. TVA integrates a bidirectional contrastive learning mechanism to maximize the discrepancy between the clean and adversarial features, and introduces a temporal consistency loss that exploits motion cues to enhance the sequential impact of perturbations. TVA avoids the need to train expensive surrogate models or access to domain-specific data, thereby offering a more practical and efficient attack strategy. Extensive experiments across 24 video-related tasks demonstrate the efficacy of TVA against downstream models and MLLMs, revealing a previously underexplored security vulnerability in the deployment of video models.

TL;DR: CRDA is a curriculum reinforcement learning framework that dynamically generates adversarial data augmentations for deepfake detection, progressively training detectors from simple to complex forgery features while using causal inference to eliminate spurious correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deepfake detectors rely on fixed data augmentation strategies that cannot adapt to the evolving complexity and diversity of real-world forgeries like facial warping and expression manipulation.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning to dynamically select augmentation actions from a configurable pool of forgery operations, guided by detector performance. Integrates causal inference to mitigate spurious correlations and focus on causally invariant features.

Result: Significantly improves detector generalizability and outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple cross-domain datasets.

Conclusion: Dynamic curriculum-based augmentation guided by RL and causal inference is essential for robust deepfake detection that can adapt to diverse real-world forgery patterns.

Abstract: The generalization capability of deepfake detectors is critical for real-world use. Data augmentation via synthetic fake face generation effectively enhances generalization, yet current SoTA methods rely on fixed strategies-raising a key question: Is a single static augmentation sufficient, or does the diversity of forgery features demand dynamic approaches? We argue existing methods overlook the evolving complexity of real-world forgeries (e.g., facial warping, expression manipulation), which fixed policies cannot fully simulate. To address this, we propose CRDA (Curriculum Reinforcement-Learning Data Augmentation), a novel framework guiding detectors to progressively master multi-domain forgery features from simple to complex. CRDA synthesizes augmented samples via a configurable pool of forgery operations and dynamically generates adversarial samples tailored to the detector's current learning state. Central to our approach is integrating reinforcement learning (RL) and causal inference. An RL agent dynamically selects augmentation actions based on detector performance to efficiently explore the vast augmentation space, adapting to increasingly challenging forgeries. Simultaneously, the agent introduces action space variations to generate heterogeneous forgery patterns, guided by causal inference to mitigate spurious correlations-suppressing task-irrelevant biases and focusing on causally invariant features. This integration ensures robust generalization by decoupling synthetic augmentation patterns from the model's learned representations. Extensive experiments show our method significantly improves detector generalizability, outperforming SOTA methods across multiple cross-domain datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RaLD is a framework that uses latent diffusion models to generate dense 3D point clouds from sparse millimeter-wave radar data, addressing limitations of existing methods through scene-level frustum-based LiDAR autoencoding and direct radar spectrum conditioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Millimeter-wave radar is robust and low-cost but produces sparse, low-resolution point clouds that limit 3D perception capabilities. Existing generative approaches use inefficient dense voxel representations and struggle to preserve structural detail.

Method: Integrates scene-level frustum-based LiDAR autoencoding, order-invariant latent representations, and direct radar spectrum conditioning to create a compact and expressive generation process using latent diffusion models.

Result: Experiments show RaLD produces dense and accurate 3D point clouds from raw radar spectrums, demonstrating improved performance for robust perception in challenging environments.

Conclusion: RaLD offers a promising solution for enhancing radar-based 3D perception by effectively leveraging latent diffusion models with compatible representations and conditioning strategies.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave radar offers a promising sensing modality for autonomous systems thanks to its robustness in adverse conditions and low cost. However, its utility is significantly limited by the sparsity and low resolution of radar point clouds, which poses challenges for tasks requiring dense and accurate 3D perception. Despite that recent efforts have shown great potential by exploring generative approaches to address this issue, they often rely on dense voxel representations that are inefficient and struggle to preserve structural detail. To fill this gap, we make the key observation that latent diffusion models (LDMs), though successful in other modalities, have not been effectively leveraged for radar-based 3D generation due to a lack of compatible representations and conditioning strategies. We introduce RaLD, a framework that bridges this gap by integrating scene-level frustum-based LiDAR autoencoding, order-invariant latent representations, and direct radar spectrum conditioning. These insights lead to a more compact and expressive generation process. Experiments show that RaLD produces dense and accurate 3D point clouds from raw radar spectrums, offering a promising solution for robust perception in challenging environments.

TL;DR: ClusterMine enables unsupervised OOD detection by mining positive labels from text corpora using visual clustering and zero-shot image-text consistency, eliminating the need for pre-defined in-distribution labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OOD detection methods rely on pre-defined in-distribution label names, which can be unavailable, unreliable at scale, or become irrelevant due to distribution shifts after deployment. The goal is to achieve truly unsupervised OOD detection.

Method: ClusterMine extracts positive concepts from large text corpora by combining visual-only sample consistency (via clustering) and zero-shot image-text consistency, operating under a general concept mining paradigm.

Result: ClusterMine achieves state-of-the-art OOD detection performance without access to positive labels, is scalable across various CLIP models, and demonstrates superior robustness to covariate in-distribution shifts.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully enables unsupervised OOD detection by leveraging widely available text corpora for positive label mining, overcoming limitations of existing approaches that require pre-defined in-distribution labels.

Abstract: Large-scale visual out-of-distribution (OOD) detection has witnessed remarkable progress by leveraging vision-language models such as CLIP. However, a significant limitation of current methods is their reliance on a pre-defined set of in-distribution (ID) ground-truth label names (positives). These fixed label names can be unavailable, unreliable at scale, or become less relevant due to in-distribution shifts after deployment. Towards truly unsupervised OOD detection, we utilize widely available text corpora for positive label mining, bypassing the need for positives. In this paper, we utilize widely available text corpora for positive label mining under a general concept mining paradigm. Within this framework, we propose ClusterMine, a novel positive label mining method. ClusterMine is the first method to achieve state-of-the-art OOD detection performance without access to positive labels. It extracts positive concepts from a large text corpus by combining visual-only sample consistency (via clustering) and zero-shot image-text consistency. Our experimental study reveals that ClusterMine is scalable across a plethora of CLIP models and achieves state-of-the-art robustness to covariate in-distribution shifts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LeCoT is a novel two-view correspondence pruning network that uses Spatial-Channel Fusion Transformer blocks to capture global context information without extra modules, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in various vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods use MLP backbones with additional modules to handle context information, which is a known limitation of MLPs. The authors aim to capture correspondence context information more naturally without extra design modules.

Method: LeCoT uses Spatial-Channel Fusion Transformer blocks that efficiently utilize both spatial and channel global context information among sparse correspondences. It also includes a prediction block that progressively refines probability sets using intermediate features to guide subsequent learning phases.

Result: Extensive experiments show LeCoT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in correspondence pruning, relative pose estimation, homography estimation, visual localization, and 3D reconstruction tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed LeCoT network effectively captures robust global context information through its novel architecture design, achieving superior performance across multiple computer vision tasks without requiring additional modules.

Abstract: Two-view correspondence pruning aims to accurately remove incorrect correspondences (outliers) from initial ones and is widely applied to various computer vision tasks. Current popular strategies adopt multilayer perceptron (MLP) as the backbone, supplemented by additional modules to enhance the network ability to handle context information, which is a known limitation of MLPs. In contrast, we introduce a novel perspective for capturing correspondence context information without extra design modules. To this end, we design a two-view correspondence pruning network called LeCoT, which can naturally leverage global context information at different stages. Specifically, the core design of LeCoT is the Spatial-Channel Fusion Transformer block, a newly proposed component that efficiently utilizes both spatial and channel global context information among sparse correspondences. In addition, we integrate the proposed prediction block that utilizes correspondence features from intermediate stages to generate a probability set, which acts as guiding information for subsequent learning phases, allowing the network to more effectively capture robust global context information. Notably, this prediction block progressively refines the probability set, thereby mitigating the issue of information loss that is common in the traditional one. Extensive experiments prove that the proposed LeCoT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in correspondence pruning, relative pose estimation, homography estimation, visual localization, and $3$D~reconstruction tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HENet++ is a multi-task 3D perception framework for autonomous driving that uses hybrid image encoding (large encoder for short-term, small for long-term frames) and simultaneous dense/sparse feature extraction to achieve state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational constraints and task-specific feature representation challenges in autonomous driving systems, where large encoders, high-resolution images, and temporal inputs are resource-intensive, and different tasks require distinct feature representations.

Method: Hybrid image encoding network with large encoder for short-term frames and small encoder for long-term frames; simultaneous extraction of dense and sparse features; compatible with various 3D feature extraction methods and multimodal inputs.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art end-to-end multi-task 3D perception results on nuScenes benchmark; attains lowest collision rate on nuScenes end-to-end autonomous driving benchmark.

Conclusion: HENet++ framework effectively addresses computational constraints and feature representation challenges in multi-task 3D perception, delivering superior performance in both perception tasks and end-to-end autonomous driving safety.

Abstract: Three-dimensional feature extraction is a critical component of autonomous driving systems, where perception tasks such as 3D object detection, bird's-eye-view (BEV) semantic segmentation, and occupancy prediction serve as important constraints on 3D features. While large image encoders, high-resolution images, and long-term temporal inputs can significantly enhance feature quality and deliver remarkable performance gains, these techniques are often incompatible in both training and inference due to computational resource constraints. Moreover, different tasks favor distinct feature representations, making it difficult for a single model to perform end-to-end inference across multiple tasks while maintaining accuracy comparable to that of single-task models. To alleviate these issues, we present the HENet and HENet++ framework for multi-task 3D perception and end-to-end autonomous driving. Specifically, we propose a hybrid image encoding network that uses a large image encoder for short-term frames and a small one for long-term frames. Furthermore, our framework simultaneously extracts both dense and sparse features, providing more suitable representations for different tasks, reducing cumulative errors, and delivering more comprehensive information to the planning module. The proposed architecture maintains compatibility with various existing 3D feature extraction methods and supports multimodal inputs. HENet++ achieves state-of-the-art end-to-end multi-task 3D perception results on the nuScenes benchmark, while also attaining the lowest collision rate on the nuScenes end-to-end autonomous driving benchmark.

TL;DR: Sparse4DGS enables dynamic 4D scene reconstruction from sparse-frame inputs by focusing on texture-rich areas through texture-aware deformation regularization and canonical optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dynamic Gaussian Splatting methods require dense-frame video sequences, but real-world scenarios often only provide sparse frames due to equipment constraints, leading to reconstruction failures in texture-rich areas.

Method: Proposes Texture-Aware Deformation Regularization with texture-based depth alignment loss for Gaussian deformation, and Texture-Aware Canonical Optimization that incorporates texture-based noise into canonical Gaussian gradient descent.

Result: Outperforms existing dynamic and few-shot techniques on NeRF-Synthetic, HyperNeRF, NeRF-DS, and iPhone-4D datasets when using sparse frames as inputs.

Conclusion: Sparse4DGS successfully addresses the challenge of sparse-frame dynamic scene reconstruction by focusing on texture-rich regions through specialized regularization and optimization techniques.

Abstract: Dynamic Gaussian Splatting approaches have achieved remarkable performance for 4D scene reconstruction. However, these approaches rely on dense-frame video sequences for photorealistic reconstruction. In real-world scenarios, due to equipment constraints, sometimes only sparse frames are accessible. In this paper, we propose Sparse4DGS, the first method for sparse-frame dynamic scene reconstruction. We observe that dynamic reconstruction methods fail in both canonical and deformed spaces under sparse-frame settings, especially in areas with high texture richness. Sparse4DGS tackles this challenge by focusing on texture-rich areas. For the deformation network, we propose Texture-Aware Deformation Regularization, which introduces a texture-based depth alignment loss to regulate Gaussian deformation. For the canonical Gaussian field, we introduce Texture-Aware Canonical Optimization, which incorporates texture-based noise into the gradient descent process of canonical Gaussians. Extensive experiments show that when taking sparse frames as inputs, our method outperforms existing dynamic or few-shot techniques on NeRF-Synthetic, HyperNeRF, NeRF-DS, and our iPhone-4D datasets.

TL;DR: Proposes MPJudge, a novel framework for assessing music-induced paintings by modeling perceptual coherence between music and visual art, using a new dataset MPD and Direct Preference Optimization for training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on emotion recognition models which introduce noise and overlook broader perceptual cues beyond emotion, making it challenging to evaluate if paintings faithfully reflect their musical inspiration.

Method: Created MPD dataset with expert-annotated music-painting pairs and pairwise preferences, then developed MPJudge model that integrates music features into visual encoder via modulation-based fusion and uses Direct Preference Optimization for training.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method outperforms existing approaches, and qualitative results demonstrate more accurate identification of music-relevant regions in paintings.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of emotion-based approaches by directly modeling perceptual coherence between music and visual art, providing better assessment of music-induced paintings.

Abstract: Music induced painting is a unique artistic practice, where visual artworks are created under the influence of music. Evaluating whether a painting faithfully reflects the music that inspired it poses a challenging perceptual assessment task. Existing methods primarily rely on emotion recognition models to assess the similarity between music and painting, but such models introduce considerable noise and overlook broader perceptual cues beyond emotion. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for music induced painting assessment that directly models perceptual coherence between music and visual art. We introduce MPD, the first large scale dataset of music painting pairs annotated by domain experts based on perceptual coherence. To better handle ambiguous cases, we further collect pairwise preference annotations. Building on this dataset, we present MPJudge, a model that integrates music features into a visual encoder via a modulation based fusion mechanism. To effectively learn from ambiguous cases, we adopt Direct Preference Optimization for training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. Qualitative results further show that our model more accurately identifies music relevant regions in paintings.

Motivation: Inspired by procedural generators in production 3D applications, the goal is to learn procedural graph representations for 3D assets to enable image-based 3D reconstruction with better generalization to real-world images.

Method: Uses sequentialized graph-based procedural representation with edge-based tokenization, trains transformer prior to predict next tokens from RGB images, and incorporates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) guided sampling for better image alignment.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art generative 3D methods and domain-specific modeling techniques on cacti, trees, and bridges, with improved generalization to real-world images despite synthetic-only training.

Conclusion: ProcGen3D provides an effective approach for neural procedural graph generation that enables high-quality 3D asset creation from images with strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce ProcGen3D, a new approach for 3D content creation by generating procedural graph abstractions of 3D objects, which can then be decoded into rich, complex 3D assets. Inspired by the prevalent use of procedural generators in production 3D applications, we propose a sequentialized, graph-based procedural graph representation for 3D assets. We use this to learn to approximate the landscape of a procedural generator for image-based 3D reconstruction. We employ edge-based tokenization to encode the procedural graphs, and train a transformer prior to predict the next token conditioned on an input RGB image. Crucially, to enable better alignment of our generated outputs to an input image, we incorporate Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) guided sampling into our generation process, steering output procedural graphs towards more image-faithful reconstructions. Our approach is applicable across a variety of objects that can be synthesized with procedural generators. Extensive experiments on cacti, trees, and bridges show that our neural procedural graph generation outperforms both state-of-the-art generative 3D methods and domain-specific modeling techniques. Furthermore, this enables improved generalization on real-world input images, despite training only on synthetic data.

Result: Substantially boosts detection performance across various detectors, with Midjourney detection accuracy improving from 87.63% to 93.03% (6.16% relative increase) on AIDE.

Conclusion: LiteUpdate effectively addresses efficiency and catastrophic forgetting issues in detector updates, enabling better adaptation to new generators while preserving prior knowledge.

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative AI has led to the emergence of new generative models, while existing detection methods struggle to keep pace, resulting in significant degradation in the detection performance. This highlights the urgent need for continuously updating AI-generated image detectors to adapt to new generators. To overcome low efficiency and catastrophic forgetting in detector updates, we propose LiteUpdate, a lightweight framework for updating AI-generated image detectors. LiteUpdate employs a representative sample selection module that leverages image confidence and gradient-based discriminative features to precisely select boundary samples. This approach improves learning and detection accuracy on new distributions with limited generated images, significantly enhancing detector update efficiency. Additionally, LiteUpdate incorporates a model merging module that fuses weights from multiple fine-tuning trajectories, including pre-trained, representative, and random updates. This balances the adaptability to new generators and mitigates the catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge. Experiments demonstrate that LiteUpdate substantially boosts detection performance in various detectors. Specifically, on AIDE, the average detection accuracy on Midjourney improved from 87.63% to 93.03%, a 6.16% relative increase.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual measurement of anatomical risk scores (Keros, Gera, TMS) on CT/CBCT scans is time-consuming and required for preoperative assessment to minimize surgical risks like CSF leakage.

Method: Deep learning pipeline using heatmap regression to localize key anatomical landmarks, comparing direct approach with specialized global-to-local learning strategy.

Result: Mean absolute errors: 0.506mm for Keros score, 4.516° for Gera score, and 0.802mm/0.777mm for TMS classification.

Conclusion: The automated pipeline provides accurate estimation of anatomical risk scores, potentially reducing manual measurement time while maintaining precision for preoperative planning.

Abstract: Endoscopic sinus surgery requires careful preoperative assessment of the skull base anatomy to minimize risks such as cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Anatomical risk scores like the Keros, Gera and Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore score offer a standardized approach but require time-consuming manual measurements on coronal CT or CBCT scans. We propose an automated deep learning pipeline that estimates these risk scores by localizing key anatomical landmarks via heatmap regression. We compare a direct approach to a specialized global-to-local learning strategy and find mean absolute errors on the relevant anatomical measurements of 0.506mm for the Keros, 4.516° for the Gera and 0.802mm / 0.777mm for the TMS classification.

Motivation: INRs have emerged as a promising framework for representing signals in low-dimensional spaces, and there's a need to systematically review specialized approaches for approximating SDFs using geometric regularization.

Method: The approach incorporates differential geometry tools (normals, curvatures) as regularization terms in loss functions to ensure INRs satisfy global properties like unit gradient for SDFs, and explores key components including INR definition, geometric loss construction, and sampling schemes.

Result: Geometric INRs enable significant advancements in surface reconstruction from both oriented point clouds and posed images by leveraging geometric constraints.

Conclusion: Geometric INRs represent a powerful approach for 3D surface reconstruction that effectively incorporates differential geometry principles to improve the quality and accuracy of neural SDF representations.

Abstract: \textit{Implicit neural representations} (INRs) have emerged as a promising framework for representing signals in low-dimensional spaces. This survey reviews the existing literature on the specialized INR problem of approximating \textit{signed distance functions} (SDFs) for surface scenes, using either oriented point clouds or a set of posed images. We refer to neural SDFs that incorporate differential geometry tools, such as normals and curvatures, in their loss functions as \textit{geometric} INRs. The key idea behind this 3D reconstruction approach is to include additional \textit{regularization} terms in the loss function, ensuring that the INR satisfies certain global properties that the function should hold -- such as having unit gradient in the case of SDFs. We explore key methodological components, including the definition of INR, the construction of geometric loss functions, and sampling schemes from a differential geometry perspective. Our review highlights the significant advancements enabled by geometric INRs in surface reconstruction from oriented point clouds and posed images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing clean-image backdoor attacks require high poison rates that cause noticeable drops in clean accuracy, compromising stealthiness. The goal is to develop more stealthy attacks that minimize accuracy degradation.

Method: Uses conditional InfoGAN to identify naturally occurring image features that serve as potent and stealthy triggers. Ensures triggers are easily separable from benign features, allowing learning from extremely small poisoned datasets.

Result: Achieves successful backdoor attacks with less than 1% clean accuracy drop across six datasets, five architectures, and four tasks (including first demonstration in regression and segmentation). Shows resilience against most existing defenses.

Conclusion: GCB provides a versatile and stealthy clean-image backdoor attack framework that minimizes accuracy degradation while maintaining attack effectiveness across diverse scenarios, highlighting significant security vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Clean-image backdoor attacks, which use only label manipulation in training datasets to compromise deep neural networks, pose a significant threat to security-critical applications. A critical flaw in existing methods is that the poison rate required for a successful attack induces a proportional, and thus noticeable, drop in Clean Accuracy (CA), undermining their stealthiness. This paper presents a new paradigm for clean-image attacks that minimizes this accuracy degradation by optimizing the trigger itself. We introduce Generative Clean-Image Backdoors (GCB), a framework that uses a conditional InfoGAN to identify naturally occurring image features that can serve as potent and stealthy triggers. By ensuring these triggers are easily separable from benign task-related features, GCB enables a victim model to learn the backdoor from an extremely small set of poisoned examples, resulting in a CA drop of less than 1%. Our experiments demonstrate GCB's remarkable versatility, successfully adapting to six datasets, five architectures, and four tasks, including the first demonstration of clean-image backdoors in regression and segmentation. GCB also exhibits resilience against most of the existing backdoor defenses.

*Kyeongjin Ahn,YongHun Suh,Sungwon Han,Jeasurk Yang,Hannes Taubenböck,Meeyoung Cha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a remote sensing framework using semi-supervised segmentation to detect refugee shelters and quantify WASH accessibility in Rohingya camps, revealing declining access and gender disparities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WASH service access remains a major public health concern in refugee camps, particularly in densely populated displacement settings like Cox's Bazar, where detecting shelters is challenging due to dense spatial configurations and irregular patterns.

Method: Developed a semi-supervised segmentation framework using sub-meter satellite images to detect individual refugee shelters, achieving 76.4% F1-score, and applied it across multi-year data to analyze WASH facility accessibility.

Result: Found declining WASH accessibility from 25 people per facility in 2022 to 29.4 in 2025, with gender-disaggregated analysis showing reduced accessibility for women and girls, especially in scenarios with inadequate safety-related segregation.

Conclusion: Highlights the importance of demand-responsive allocation strategies and demonstrates the value of remote sensing and machine learning for detecting inequality and informing equitable resource planning in humanitarian environments.

Abstract: Access to Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) services remains a major public health concern in refugee camps. This study introduces a remote sensing-driven framework to quantify WASH accessibility-specifically to water pumps, latrines, and bathing cubicles-in the Rohingya camps of Cox's Bazar, one of the world's most densely populated displacement settings. Detecting refugee shelters in such emergent camps presents substantial challenges, primarily due to their dense spatial configuration and irregular geometric patterns. Using sub-meter satellite images, we develop a semi-supervised segmentation framework that achieves an F1-score of 76.4% in detecting individual refugee shelters. Applying the framework across multi-year data reveals declining WASH accessibility, driven by rapid refugee population growth and reduced facility availability, rising from 25 people per facility in 2022 to 29.4 in 2025. Gender-disaggregated analysis further shows that women and girls experience reduced accessibility, in scenarios with inadequate safety-related segregation in WASH facilities. These findings suggest the importance of demand-responsive allocation strategies that can identify areas with under-served populations-such as women and girls-and ensure that limited infrastructure serves the greatest number of people in settings with fixed or shrinking budgets. We also discuss the value of high-resolution remote sensing and machine learning to detect inequality and inform equitable resource planning in complex humanitarian environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting representative examples of all possible anomalies is infeasible in industrial inspection, so the paper tackles structural anomaly detection using self-supervised learning to identify subtle defects in uniform visual patterns.

Method: Uses a corruption model that injects artificial structured disruptions into training images to mimic structural defects, with Gaussian noise added as a Tikhonov regularizer to stabilize reconstruction by anchoring the Jacobian toward identity.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MVTec AD benchmark with I/P-AUROC scores of 99.9/99.4, demonstrating improved detection and segmentation accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed identity-anchored regularization stabilizes reconstruction and improves both detection and segmentation performance, supporting the theoretical framework and demonstrating practical relevance for automatic industrial inspection.

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in automated industrial inspection, aiming to identify subtle or rare defects in otherwise uniform visual patterns. As collecting representative examples of all possible anomalies is infeasible, we tackle structural anomaly detection using a self-supervised autoencoder that learns to repair corrupted inputs. To this end, we introduce a corruption model that injects artificial disruptions into training images to mimic structural defects. While reminiscent of denoising autoencoders, our approach differs in two key aspects. First, instead of unstructured i.i.d.\ noise, we apply structured, spatially coherent perturbations that make the task a hybrid of segmentation and inpainting. Second, and counterintuitively, we add and preserve Gaussian noise on top of the occlusions, which acts as a Tikhonov regularizer anchoring the Jacobian of the reconstruction function toward identity. This identity-anchored regularization stabilizes reconstruction and further improves both detection and segmentation accuracy. On the MVTec AD benchmark, our method achieves state-of-the-art results (I/P-AUROC: 99.9/99.4), supporting our theoretical framework and demonstrating its practical relevance for automatic inspection.

Motivation: Previous 4D generation methods struggle with spatial-temporal consistency and poor adaptation to rapid temporal variations due to ineffective spatial-temporal modeling.

Method: Modulates generative 4D Gaussian Splatting with spatial-temporal rectification, using temporal correlation to rectify deformable scales/rotations and an adaptive spatial densification/pruning strategy to handle temporal variations by dynamically managing Gaussian points based on movement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in video-to-4D generation with excellent reconstruction quality, spatial-temporal consistency, and adaptation to rapid temporal movements.

Conclusion: 4DSTR effectively addresses spatial-temporal consistency issues in 4D generation through its novel rectification and adaptive point management approach.

Abstract: Remarkable advances in recent 2D image and 3D shape generation have induced a significant focus on dynamic 4D content generation. However, previous 4D generation methods commonly struggle to maintain spatial-temporal consistency and adapt poorly to rapid temporal variations, due to the lack of effective spatial-temporal modeling. To address these problems, we propose a novel 4D generation network called 4DSTR, which modulates generative 4D Gaussian Splatting with spatial-temporal rectification. Specifically, temporal correlation across generated 4D sequences is designed to rectify deformable scales and rotations and guarantee temporal consistency. Furthermore, an adaptive spatial densification and pruning strategy is proposed to address significant temporal variations by dynamically adding or deleting Gaussian points with the awareness of their pre-frame movements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 4DSTR achieves state-of-the-art performance in video-to-4D generation, excelling in reconstruction quality, spatial-temporal consistency, and adaptation to rapid temporal movements.

*Yilong Chen,Xiang Bai,Zhibin Wang,Chengyu Bai,Yuhan Dai,Ming Lu,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StreamKV is a training-free framework that enhances Video-LLMs for long video processing by dynamically partitioning videos into semantic segments and performing layer-adaptive KV cache retrieval and compression, achieving superior accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Video-LLMs struggle with long real-world videos, and existing KV cache retrieval methods use uniform partitioning which doesn't preserve semantic information well. The compression and retrieval of KV caches remain underexplored.

Method: StreamKV dynamically partitions video streams into semantic segments, calculates summary vectors for retrieval, uses guidance prompts for compression, and unifies both processes in a layer-adaptive single module.

Result: Extensive experiments on StreamingVQA benchmarks show StreamKV significantly outperforms existing Online Video-LLMs in accuracy while substantially improving memory efficiency and computational latency.

Conclusion: StreamKV effectively addresses long video processing challenges in Video-LLMs through semantic-aware dynamic partitioning and unified KV cache management, providing a practical solution for streaming video question answering.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in the areas of video captioning, search, and summarization. However, current Video-LLMs still face challenges with long real-world videos. Recent methods have introduced a retrieval mechanism that retrieves query-relevant KV caches for question answering, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of long real-world videos. However, the compression and retrieval of KV caches are still not fully explored. In this paper, we propose \textbf{StreamKV}, a training-free framework that seamlessly equips Video-LLMs with advanced KV cache retrieval and compression. Compared to previous methods that used uniform partitioning, StreamKV dynamically partitions video streams into semantic segments, which better preserves semantic information. For KV cache retrieval, StreamKV calculates a summary vector for each segment to retain segment-level information essential for retrieval. For KV cache compression, StreamKV introduces a guidance prompt designed to capture the key semantic elements within each segment, ensuring only the most informative KV caches are retained for answering questions. Moreover, StreamKV unifies KV cache retrieval and compression within a single module, performing both in a layer-adaptive manner, thereby further improving the effectiveness of streaming video question answering. Extensive experiments on public StreamingVQA benchmarks demonstrate that StreamKV significantly outperforms existing Online Video-LLMs, achieving superior accuracy while substantially improving both memory efficiency and computational latency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework using Res-UNet architecture for automatic ischemic stroke lesion segmentation on multiple MRI sequences, achieving 80.5% Dice score and 74.03% accuracy on ISLES 2015 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual lesion segmentation by experts is tedious, time-consuming, and prone to inconsistency. Previous automatic methods using hand-crafted features fail to capture the irregular and complex shapes of ischemic stroke lesions.

Method: Used Res-UNet architecture trained twice (with and without pre-existing weights) on ISLES 2015 dataset across T1-weighted, T2-weighted, DWI, and FLAIR MRI sequences. Integrated Majority Voting Classifier to combine results from each axis.

Result: Achieved Dice score of 80.5% and accuracy of 74.03% on 3D volumes, demonstrating effective segmentation performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides an efficient and accurate automated solution for ischemic stroke lesion segmentation across various MRI sequences, overcoming limitations of manual segmentation and traditional feature-based methods.

Abstract: The accurate understanding of ischemic stroke lesions is critical for efficient therapy and prognosis of stroke patients. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is sensitive to acute ischemic stroke and is a common diagnostic method for stroke. However, manual lesion segmentation performed by experts is tedious, time-consuming, and prone to observer inconsistency. Automatic medical image analysis methods have been proposed to overcome this challenge. However, previous approaches have relied on hand-crafted features that may not capture the irregular and physiologically complex shapes of ischemic stroke lesions. In this study, we present a novel framework for quickly and automatically segmenting ischemic stroke lesions on various MRI sequences, including T1-weighted, T2-weighted, DWI, and FLAIR. The proposed methodology is validated on the ISLES 2015 Brain Stroke sequence dataset, where we trained our model using the Res-Unet architecture twice: first, with pre-existing weights, and then without, to explore the benefits of transfer learning. Evaluation metrics, including the Dice score and sensitivity, were computed across 3D volumes. Finally, a Majority Voting Classifier was integrated to amalgamate the outcomes from each axis, resulting in a comprehensive segmentation method. Our efforts culminated in achieving a Dice score of 80.5\% and an accuracy of 74.03\%, showcasing the efficacy of our segmentation approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VADER is an LLM-driven framework for Video Anomaly Understanding that integrates object relation features with visual cues to provide detailed interpretation of anomalous events, addressing limitations of traditional detection-only methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video anomaly methods focus only on detecting and localizing anomalies but neglect deeper causal relationships and object interactions critical for understanding anomalous behaviors.

Method: VADER uses an Anomaly Scorer for per-frame scores, Context-Aware Sampling to capture causal context, Relation Feature Extractor and Contrastive Relation Encoder to model object interactions, then integrates visual/relational cues with LLMs for reasoning.

Result: Experiments on multiple real-world VAU benchmarks show VADER achieves strong results across anomaly description, explanation, and causal reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: VADER advances the frontier of explainable video anomaly analysis by providing detailed, causally grounded descriptions and robust anomaly-related question answering.

Abstract: Video anomaly understanding (VAU) aims to provide detailed interpretation and semantic comprehension of anomalous events within videos, addressing limitations of traditional methods that focus solely on detecting and localizing anomalies. However, existing approaches often neglect the deeper causal relationships and interactions between objects, which are critical for understanding anomalous behaviors. In this paper, we propose VADER, an LLM-driven framework for Video Anomaly unDErstanding, which integrates keyframe object Relation features with visual cues to enhance anomaly comprehension from video. Specifically, VADER first applies an Anomaly Scorer to assign per-frame anomaly scores, followed by a Context-AwarE Sampling (CAES) strategy to capture the causal context of each anomalous event. A Relation Feature Extractor and a COntrastive Relation Encoder (CORE) jointly model dynamic object interactions, producing compact relational representations for downstream reasoning. These visual and relational cues are integrated with LLMs to generate detailed, causally grounded descriptions and support robust anomaly-related question answering. Experiments on multiple real-world VAU benchmarks demonstrate that VADER achieves strong results across anomaly description, explanation, and causal reasoning tasks, advancing the frontier of explainable video anomaly analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fast and flexible 3D scene reconstruction from unstructured image collections remains challenging, especially when dealing with varying camera parameters and pose uncertainties.

Method: Predicts local Gaussians and camera poses for each view, aggregates them using mixing training strategy with gradual transition from ground-truth to predicted poses, resolves scale ambiguity with pairwise camera-distance normalization, and embeds camera intrinsics into the network.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks in both pose-free and pose-dependent settings, reconstructing scenes from 100 views in just 2.69 seconds on NVIDIA GH200 GPU.

Conclusion: YoNoSplat provides an efficient and versatile solution for 3D scene reconstruction from unstructured image collections, overcoming joint learning challenges through novel training strategies and achieving superior performance with remarkable speed.

Abstract: Fast and flexible 3D scene reconstruction from unstructured image collections remains a significant challenge. We present YoNoSplat, a feedforward model that reconstructs high-quality 3D Gaussian Splatting representations from an arbitrary number of images. Our model is highly versatile, operating effectively with both posed and unposed, calibrated and uncalibrated inputs. YoNoSplat predicts local Gaussians and camera poses for each view, which are aggregated into a global representation using either predicted or provided poses. To overcome the inherent difficulty of jointly learning 3D Gaussians and camera parameters, we introduce a novel mixing training strategy. This approach mitigates the entanglement between the two tasks by initially using ground-truth poses to aggregate local Gaussians and gradually transitioning to a mix of predicted and ground-truth poses, which prevents both training instability and exposure bias. We further resolve the scale ambiguity problem by a novel pairwise camera-distance normalization scheme and by embedding camera intrinsics into the network. Moreover, YoNoSplat also predicts intrinsic parameters, making it feasible for uncalibrated inputs. YoNoSplat demonstrates exceptional efficiency, reconstructing a scene from 100 views (at 280x518 resolution) in just 2.69 seconds on an NVIDIA GH200 GPU. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks in both pose-free and pose-dependent settings. Our project page is at https://botaoye.github.io/yonosplat/.

Among these models, YOLO11m achieved the highest accuracy of 92.39\% in waste detection, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting waste. Additionally, it attains an mAP@50 of 0.91, highlighting its high precision. These findings confirm that the object detection model is well-suited for monitoring and tracking waste dumping events at GVP locations. Furthermore, the system effectively captures waste disposal patterns, including hourly, daily, and weekly dumping trends, ensuring comprehensive daily and nightly monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StreamDiffusionV2 is a training-free pipeline for real-time live streaming with video diffusion models that addresses temporal consistency and latency challenges through system-level optimizations like SLO-aware scheduling, KV cache management, and scalable multi-GPU orchestration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image-based streaming diffusion models lack temporal consistency, while offline video generation systems are optimized for throughput rather than real-time latency requirements. Live streaming has strict SLOs for minimal time-to-first-frame and per-frame deadlines with low jitter.

Method: Integrates SLO-aware batching scheduler, block scheduler, sink-token-guided rolling KV cache, motion-aware noise controller, and scalable pipeline orchestration that parallelizes diffusion across denoising steps and network layers.

Result: Achieves first frame within 0.5s, 58.28 FPS with 14B-parameter model and 64.52 FPS with 1.3B-parameter model on four H100 GPUs, with near-linear FPS scaling without violating latency guarantees.

Conclusion: Makes state-of-the-art generative live streaming practical and accessible across different scales, supporting both ultra-low-latency and higher-quality modes with flexible denoising steps.

Abstract: Generative models are reshaping the live-streaming industry by redefining how content is created, styled, and delivered. Previous image-based streaming diffusion models have powered efficient and creative live streaming products but have hit limits on temporal consistency due to the foundation of image-based designs. Recent advances in video diffusion have markedly improved temporal consistency and sampling efficiency for offline generation. However, offline generation systems primarily optimize throughput by batching large workloads. In contrast, live online streaming operates under strict service-level objectives (SLOs): time-to-first-frame must be minimal, and every frame must meet a per-frame deadline with low jitter. Besides, scalable multi-GPU serving for real-time streams remains largely unresolved so far. To address this, we present StreamDiffusionV2, a training-free pipeline for interactive live streaming with video diffusion models. StreamDiffusionV2 integrates an SLO-aware batching scheduler and a block scheduler, together with a sink-token--guided rolling KV cache, a motion-aware noise controller, and other system-level optimizations. Moreover, we introduce a scalable pipeline orchestration that parallelizes the diffusion process across denoising steps and network layers, achieving near-linear FPS scaling without violating latency guarantees. The system scales seamlessly across heterogeneous GPU environments and supports flexible denoising steps (e.g., 1--4), enabling both ultra-low-latency and higher-quality modes. Without TensorRT or quantization, StreamDiffusionV2 renders the first frame within 0.5s and attains 58.28 FPS with a 14B-parameter model and 64.52 FPS with a 1.3B-parameter model on four H100 GPUs, making state-of-the-art generative live streaming practical and accessible--from individual creators to enterprise-scale platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable generating diverse 3D motions for arbitrary objects from just a single input image, which is challenging due to the need to infer motion patterns without temporal information.

Method: Leverage video model priors to extract motion patterns, embed them into a shared latent space, train a motion decoder to learn neural key point trajectories, and drive 3D Gaussians with these key points for geometry and appearance modeling.

Result: The system can instantly sample diverse 3D motions in a single-forward pass during inference and supports applications like 3D motion interpolation and language-guided motion generation.

Conclusion: DIMO successfully demonstrates the ability to generate diverse 3D motions from single images through learned latent representations and has practical applications in motion generation and editing.

Abstract: We present DIMO, a generative approach capable of generating diverse 3D motions for arbitrary objects from a single image. The core idea of our work is to leverage the rich priors in well-trained video models to extract the common motion patterns and then embed them into a shared low-dimensional latent space. Specifically, we first generate multiple videos of the same object with diverse motions. We then embed each motion into a latent vector and train a shared motion decoder to learn the distribution of motions represented by a structured and compact motion representation, i.e., neural key point trajectories. The canonical 3D Gaussians are then driven by these key points and fused to model the geometry and appearance. During inference time with learned latent space, we can instantly sample diverse 3D motions in a single-forward pass and support several interesting applications including 3D motion interpolation and language-guided motion generation.

TL;DR: The paper presents a unified stochastic framework that connects biological swarms, physical systems, and robotic swarms through shared statistical mechanisms based on energy function constraints and maximization principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a unified framework explaining stochastic behavior in both biological swarms (like ant colonies) and physical systems (gases, liquids, solids), which currently lack such integration despite their analogous random particle motion.

Method: Used empirical evidence from Formica polyctena ants to identify shared statistical mechanisms, then applied these principles to robotic swarms governed by energy function constraints and maximization.

Result: Demonstrated that robotic swarms can exhibit scalable, decentralized cooperation and mimic physical phase-like behaviors with minimal individual computation, successfully bridging biological, physical, and robotic systems.

Conclusion: Established a unified stochastic model linking biological, physical, and robotic swarms, providing a scalable principle for designing robust and intelligent swarm robotics systems.

Abstract: Biological swarms, such as ant colonies, achieve collective goals through decentralized and stochastic individual behaviors. Similarly, physical systems composed of gases, liquids, and solids exhibit random particle motion governed by entropy maximization, yet do not achieve collective objectives. Despite this analogy, no unified framework exists to explain the stochastic behavior in both biological and physical systems. Here, we present empirical evidence from \textit{Formica polyctena} ants that reveals a shared statistical mechanism underlying both systems: maximization under different energy function constraints. We further demonstrate that robotic swarms governed by this principle can exhibit scalable, decentralized cooperation, mimicking physical phase-like behaviors with minimal individual computation. These findings established a unified stochastic model linking biological, physical, and robotic swarms, offering a scalable principle for designing robust and intelligent swarm robotics.

Motivation: Existing robotic grasping methods require large-scale expert annotations and need retraining for new objects, limiting their practical deployment and generalization capabilities.

Method: Uses vision-language models to generate goal images showing objects impaled by rods (representing antipodal grasps), predicts depth and segmentation to lift to 3D, then aligns generated and observed point clouds via PCA and correspondence-free optimization to recover grasp poses.

Result: Achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art supervised models on Cornell and Jacquard datasets, and demonstrates zero-shot generalization to novel real-world objects on a Franka Research 3 robot.

Conclusion: Vision-language foundation models serve as powerful priors for robotic manipulation, enabling training-free zero-shot grasping that generalizes well to novel objects without curated datasets.

Abstract: Robotic grasping is a fundamental capability for autonomous manipulation; however, most existing methods rely on large-scale expert annotations and necessitate retraining to handle new objects. We present VLAD-Grasp, a Vision-Language model Assisted zero-shot approach for Detecting grasps. From a single RGB-D image, our method (1) prompts a large vision-language model to generate a goal image where a straight rod "impales" the object, representing an antipodal grasp, (2) predicts depth and segmentation to lift this generated image into 3D, and (3) aligns generated and observed object point clouds via principal component analysis and correspondence-free optimization to recover an executable grasp pose. Unlike prior work, our approach is training-free and does not rely on curated grasp datasets. Despite this, VLAD-Grasp achieves performance that is competitive with or superior to that of state-of-the-art supervised models on the Cornell and Jacquard datasets. We further demonstrate zero-shot generalization to novel real-world objects on a Franka Research 3 robot, highlighting vision-language foundation models as powerful priors for robotic manipulation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A new grasp-synthesis approach using a two-player game formulation where one player controls the robot to generate grasps and another adversarially controls the object to seek escape motions, achieving significantly higher success rates than state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-finger robot hands struggle with reliable grasping as existing approaches focus on resisting single wrenches while ignoring adversarial object movements like escaping, leading to instability and failed grasps.

Method: Formulates grasp synthesis as a two-player game: one player generates feasible grasp configurations for the robot, while the other adversarially controls the object to find escape motions, explicitly capturing adversarial object movement.

Result: Achieves 75.78% success rate in simulations (up to 19.61% higher than baseline), with 27.40% improvement over non-game methods. Real-world experiments show 85.0% success on ShadowHand and 87.5% on LeapHand, with grasp generation taking 0.28-1.04 seconds.

Conclusion: The two-player game formulation effectively improves grasp reliability by considering adversarial object motions, making the approach suitable for real-world deployment with high success rates and fast computation times.

Abstract: For many complex tasks, multi-finger robot hands are poised to revolutionize how we interact with the world, but reliably grasping objects remains a significant challenge. We focus on the problem of synthesizing grasps for multi-finger robot hands that, given a target object's geometry and pose, computes a hand configuration. Existing approaches often struggle to produce reliable grasps that sufficiently constrain object motion, leading to instability under disturbances and failed grasps. A key reason is that during grasp generation, they typically focus on resisting a single wrench, while ignoring the object's potential for adversarial movements, such as escaping. We propose a new grasp-synthesis approach that explicitly captures and leverages the adversarial object motion in grasp generation by formulating the problem as a two-player game. One player controls the robot to generate feasible grasp configurations, while the other adversarially controls the object to seek motions that attempt to escape from the grasp. Simulation experiments on various robot platforms and target objects show that our approach achieves a success rate of 75.78%, up to 19.61% higher than the state-of-the-art baseline. The two-player game mechanism improves the grasping success rate by 27.40% over the method without the game formulation. Our approach requires only 0.28-1.04 seconds on average to generate a grasp configuration, depending on the robot platform, making it suitable for real-world deployment. In real-world experiments, our approach achieves an average success rate of 85.0% on ShadowHand and 87.5% on LeapHand, which confirms its feasibility and effectiveness in real robot setups.

Result: Validated through physics-based simulations and real-world experiments, the framework constructs metrically scaled 3D terrain maps in real-time and enables autonomous grasping of convex terrain surfaces.

Conclusion: The method provides scalable and energy-efficient perception for space missions using limbed climbing robots, eliminating the need for power-intensive RGB-D cameras while maintaining accurate 3D mapping capabilities.

Abstract: Limbed climbing robots are designed to explore challenging vertical walls, such as the skylights of the Moon and Mars. In such robots, the primary role of a hand-eye camera is to accurately estimate 3D positions of graspable points (i.e., convex terrain surfaces) thanks to its close-up views. While conventional climbing robots often employ RGB-D cameras as hand-eye cameras to facilitate straightforward 3D terrain mapping and graspable point detection, RGB-D cameras are large and consume considerable power.
  This work presents a 3D terrain mapping system designed for space exploration using limbed climbing robots equipped with a monocular hand-eye camera. Compared to RGB-D cameras, monocular cameras are more lightweight, compact structures, and have lower power consumption. Although monocular SLAM can be used to construct 3D maps, it suffers from scale ambiguity. To address this limitation, we propose a SLAM method that fuses monocular visual constraints with limb forward kinematics. The proposed method jointly estimates time-series gripper poses and the global metric scale of the 3D map based on factor graph optimization.
  We validate the proposed framework through both physics-based simulations and real-world experiments. The results demonstrate that our framework constructs a metrically scaled 3D terrain map in real-time and enables autonomous grasping of convex terrain surfaces using a monocular hand-eye camera, without relying on RGB-D cameras. Our method contributes to scalable and energy-efficient perception for future space missions involving limbed climbing robots. See the video summary here: https://youtu.be/fMBrrVNKJfc

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches for autonomous long-horizon manipulation require extensive real-world data and expert engineering, which are costly and not scalable.

Method: Complex tasks are decomposed into atomic skills using VLMs, with RL-trained policies for each primitive in simulation. RL includes force constraints to prevent object damage. VLM-generated demonstrations are distilled into a unified Visual-Tactile Diffusion Policy for end-to-end execution.

Result: The approach achieves policy learning for long-horizon manipulation without costly human demonstrations and enables scalable generalization to diverse tasks, validated through simulation experiments and physical deployment.

Conclusion: The proposed framework overcomes the limitations of traditional methods by integrating hierarchical semantic decomposition, RL, VLMs, and knowledge distillation, facilitating scalable and cost-effective autonomous manipulation.

Abstract: Autonomous execution of long-horizon, contact-rich manipulation tasks traditionally requires extensive real-world data and expert engineering, posing significant cost and scalability challenges. This paper proposes a novel framework integrating hierarchical semantic decomposition, reinforcement learning (RL), visual language models (VLMs), and knowledge distillation to overcome these limitations. Complex tasks are decomposed into atomic skills, with RL-trained policies for each primitive exclusively in simulation. Crucially, our RL formulation incorporates explicit force constraints to prevent object damage during delicate interactions. VLMs perform high-level task decomposition and skill planning, generating diverse expert demonstrations. These are distilled into a unified policy via Visual-Tactile Diffusion Policy for end-to-end execution. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies exploring different VLM-based task planners to identify optimal demonstration generation pipelines, and systematically compare imitation learning algorithms for skill distillation. Extensive simulation experiments and physical deployment validate that our approach achieves policy learning for long-horizon manipulation without costly human demonstrations, while the VLM-guided atomic skill framework enables scalable generalization to diverse tasks.

Conclusion: ViTaMIn-B provides a more capable and efficient handheld data collection system for complex bimanual manipulation tasks with improved tactile sensing and pose tracking capabilities.

Abstract: Handheld devices have opened up unprecedented opportunities to collect large-scale, high-quality demonstrations efficiently. However, existing systems often lack robust tactile sensing or reliable pose tracking to handle complex interaction scenarios, especially for bimanual and contact-rich tasks. In this work, we propose ViTaMIn-B, a more capable and efficient handheld data collection system for such tasks. We first design DuoTact, a novel compliant visuo-tactile sensor built with a flexible frame to withstand large contact forces during manipulation while capturing high-resolution contact geometry. To enhance the cross-sensor generalizability, we propose reconstructing the sensor's global deformation as a 3D point cloud and using it as the policy input. We further develop a robust, unified 6-DoF bimanual pose acquisition process using Meta Quest controllers, which eliminates the trajectory drift issue in common SLAM-based methods. Comprehensive user studies confirm the efficiency and high usability of ViTaMIn-B among novice and expert operators. Furthermore, experiments on four bimanual manipulation tasks demonstrate its superior task performance relative to existing systems.

TL;DR: A fairness-aware hierarchical control framework for CAV intersection coordination that integrates inequity aversion, achieves near-perfect fairness, eliminates collisions, reduces delays, and maintains real-time feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness in CAV intersection coordination is essential for equitable access, social acceptance, and long-term efficiency, but remains underexplored in safety-critical real-time traffic control.

Method: Two-layer hierarchical framework: top layer uses centralized allocation to assign control authority by maximizing utility considering waiting time, urgency, control history, and velocity deviation; bottom layer executes precomputed trajectories using LQR with HOCBF-based safety filter for real-time collision avoidance.

Result: Simulations show near-perfect fairness, collision elimination, reduced average delay, and maintained real-time feasibility across varying traffic demands and distributions.

Conclusion: Fairness can be systematically incorporated into CAV intersection coordination without sacrificing safety or performance, enabling scalable and equitable autonomous traffic systems.

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in the coordination of connected and automated vehicles at intersections is essential for equitable access, social acceptance, and long-term system efficiency, yet it remains underexplored in safety-critical, real-time traffic control. This paper proposes a fairness-aware hierarchical control framework that explicitly integrates inequity aversion into intersection management. At the top layer, a centralized allocation module assigns control authority (i.e., selects a single vehicle to execute its trajectory) by maximizing a utility that accounts for waiting time, urgency, control history, and velocity deviation. At the bottom layer, the authorized vehicle executes a precomputed trajectory using a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and applies a high-order Control Barrier Function (HOCBF)-based safety filter for real-time collision avoidance. Simulation results across varying traffic demands and demand distributions demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves near-perfect fairness, eliminates collisions, reduces average delay, and maintains real-time feasibility. These results highlight that fairness can be systematically incorporated without sacrificing safety or performance, enabling scalable and equitable coordination for future autonomous traffic systems.

*Zeyuan Feng,Haimingyue Zhang,Somil Bansal*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A modular framework for language-conditioned safety in robot navigation that uses LLMs to translate instructions into safety specs, perception to ground them in 3D, and MPC to enforce constraints in real time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots need to interpret natural language instructions and adhere to safety constraints for effective human interaction, but existing approaches focus on rewards rather than safety specs or handle only narrow constraint classes.

Method: Three-component framework: LLM module translates free-form instructions to structured safety specs, perception module grounds specs in object-level 3D representations, and MPC-based safety filter enforces semantic and geometric constraints in real time.

Result: The framework robustly interprets and enforces diverse language-specified constraints across various environments and scenarios, validated through simulation and hardware experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed modular framework effectively enables robots to understand and comply with natural language safety instructions, enhancing their reliability and trustworthiness in human-centered environments.

Abstract: As robots become increasingly integrated into open-world, human-centered environments, their ability to interpret natural language instructions and adhere to safety constraints is critical for effective and trustworthy interaction. Existing approaches often focus on mapping language to reward functions instead of safety specifications or address only narrow constraint classes (e.g., obstacle avoidance), limiting their robustness and applicability. We propose a modular framework for language-conditioned safety in robot navigation. Our framework is composed of three core components: (1) a large language model (LLM)-based module that translates free-form instructions into structured safety specifications, (2) a perception module that grounds these specifications by maintaining object-level 3D representations of the environment, and (3) a model predictive control (MPC)-based safety filter that enforces both semantic and geometric constraints in real time. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through both simulation studies and hardware experiments, demonstrating that it robustly interprets and enforces diverse language-specified constraints across a wide range of environments and scenarios.

Conclusion: Established a unified and manufacturable framework for soft sleeve actuation that enables more effective, comfortable, and anatomically compatible wearable assistive technologies with superior performance characteristics.

Abstract: Aging populations and the rising prevalence of neurological and musculoskeletal disorders increase the demand for wearable mobility assistive devices that are effective, comfortable, and anatomically compatible. Many existing systems use rigid mechanisms and bulky interfaces that impede force transmission and reduce wearability. This study introduces a soft sleeve actuation architecture that conforms to the limb while transmitting forces and moments efficiently. We develop three soft sleeve actuators that produce linear, bending, and twisting motion, and an omnidirectional design that combines these motions in one device. Actuators are fabricated from thermoplastic elastomers using a customized fused filament fabrication process that produces airtight and compliant structures and resolves leakage observed with conventional methods. A dedicated experimental platform quantifies kinematic outputs such as displacement, angle, and twist, and kinetic outputs such as force and torque under low pneumatic pressures. A parametric study varies geometric features and material properties to determine their influence on performance. Results show reproducible multi axis motion with improved transfer of force to the limb and reduced need for complex attachment hardware. The work establishes a unified and manufacturable framework for soft sleeve actuation that enables compact and user centered assistive technologies with enhanced kinematic and kinetic performance.

Motivation: Address the challenges of outdoor aerial VLN including data acquisition difficulties and long-horizon trajectory planning requirements for UAVs in complex environments.

Method: Reconfigure reinforcement learning to optimize VLM for UAV navigation tasks using rule-based policies for efficient fine-tuning with limited data, and introduce a long-horizon planner for dynamic trajectory synthesis via value-based rewards.

Result: Achieved consistent performance gains of up to 4.34% in Success Rate, 6.19% in Oracle Success Rate, and 4.07% in Success weighted by Path Length over baseline methods on the TravelUAV benchmark.

Conclusion: The framework validates effective deployment for long-horizon UAV navigation in complex aerial environments, demonstrating data efficiency and enhanced planning capabilities.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have been widely-applied in ground-based vision-language navigation (VLN). However, the vast complexity of outdoor aerial environments compounds data acquisition challenges and imposes long-horizon trajectory planning requirements on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), introducing novel complexities for aerial VLN. To address these challenges, we propose a data-efficient Open-world aerial Vision-Language Navigation (i.e., OpenVLN) framework, which could execute language-guided flight with limited data constraints and enhance long-horizon trajectory planning capabilities in complex aerial environments. Specifically, we reconfigure a reinforcement learning framework to optimize the VLM for UAV navigation tasks, which can efficiently fine-tune VLM by using rule-based policies under limited training data. Concurrently, we introduce a long-horizon planner for trajectory synthesis that dynamically generates precise UAV actions via value-based rewards. To the end, we conduct sufficient navigation experiments on the TravelUAV benchmark with dataset scaling across diverse reward settings. Our method demonstrates consistent performance gains of up to 4.34% in Success Rate, 6.19% in Oracle Success Rate, and 4.07% in Success weighted by Path Length over baseline methods, validating its deployment efficacy for long-horizon UAV navigation in complex aerial environments.

Motivation: Existing VLA models show poor adaptation to new environments despite good zero-shot generalization. Real-world applications often require consistent high performance on specific tasks rather than broad generalization.

Method: Stores compact feature representations from frozen vision backbone (97% memory reduction), retrieves relevant experiences via cosine similarity, uses prioritized replay for successful trajectories, and applies Thresholded Hybrid Contrastive Loss for learning from both successes and failures.

Result: LIBERO benchmark: improved from 82.6% to 93.1% on spatial reasoning, 61% to 72.3% on long-horizon tasks. Physical robot: 98% success on seen/unseen settings vs 84.7%/32% for naive fine-tuning. Adaptation takes 31 seconds with 12 demos on single GPU.

Conclusion: ExpReS-VLA enables efficient specialization of VLA models for practical robot deployment, achieving high success rates with minimal adaptation time while preventing catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models such as OpenVLA show impressive zero-shot generalization across robotic manipulation tasks but often fail to adapt efficiently to new deployment environments. In many real-world applications, consistent high performance on a limited set of tasks is more important than broad generalization. We propose ExpReS-VLA, a method for specializing pre-trained VLA models through experience replay and retrieval while preventing catastrophic forgetting. ExpReS-VLA stores compact feature representations from the frozen vision backbone instead of raw image-action pairs, reducing memory usage by approximately 97 percent. During deployment, relevant past experiences are retrieved using cosine similarity and used to guide adaptation, while prioritized experience replay emphasizes successful trajectories. We also introduce Thresholded Hybrid Contrastive Loss, which enables learning from both successful and failed attempts. On the LIBERO simulation benchmark, ExpReS-VLA improves success rates from 82.6 to 93.1 percent on spatial reasoning tasks and from 61 to 72.3 percent on long-horizon tasks. On physical robot experiments with five manipulation tasks, it reaches 98 percent success on both seen and unseen settings, compared to 84.7 and 32 percent for naive fine-tuning. Adaptation takes 31 seconds using 12 demonstrations on a single RTX 5090 GPU, making the approach practical for real robot deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for robot base placement navigate to proximity-based regions without considering affordances, leading to frequent manipulation failures in open-vocabulary mobile manipulation tasks.

Method: Affordance-Guided Coarse-to-Fine Exploration framework that constructs cross-modal representations (Affordance RGB and Obstacle Map+) to align semantics with spatial context, uses coarse semantic priors from VLMs to guide search toward task-relevant regions, and refines placements with geometric constraints.

Result: Achieves 85% success rate on five diverse open-vocabulary mobile manipulation tasks, significantly outperforming classical geometric planners and VLM-based methods.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the promise of affordance-aware and multimodal reasoning for generalizable, instruction-conditioned planning in open-vocabulary mobile manipulation.

Abstract: In open-vocabulary mobile manipulation (OVMM), task success often hinges on the selection of an appropriate base placement for the robot. Existing approaches typically navigate to proximity-based regions without considering affordances, resulting in frequent manipulation failures. We propose Affordance-Guided Coarse-to-Fine Exploration, a zero-shot framework for base placement that integrates semantic understanding from vision-language models (VLMs) with geometric feasibility through an iterative optimization process. Our method constructs cross-modal representations, namely Affordance RGB and Obstacle Map+, to align semantics with spatial context. This enables reasoning that extends beyond the egocentric limitations of RGB perception. To ensure interaction is guided by task-relevant affordances, we leverage coarse semantic priors from VLMs to guide the search toward task-relevant regions and refine placements with geometric constraints, thereby reducing the risk of convergence to local optima. Evaluated on five diverse open-vocabulary mobile manipulation tasks, our system achieves an 85% success rate, significantly outperforming classical geometric planners and VLM-based methods. This demonstrates the promise of affordance-aware and multimodal reasoning for generalizable, instruction-conditioned planning in OVMM.

Conclusion: The proposed differentiable collision detection framework enables robust gradient computation for both convex and concave objects, advancing gradient-based optimization in contact-rich robotics applications.

Abstract: Collision detection is a core component of robotics applications such as simulation, control, and planning. Traditional algorithms like GJK+EPA compute witness points (i.e., the closest or deepest-penetration pairs between two objects) but are inherently non-differentiable, preventing gradient flow and limiting gradient-based optimization in contact-rich tasks such as grasping and manipulation. Recent work introduced efficient first-order randomized smoothing to make witness points differentiable; however, their direction-based formulation is restricted to convex objects and lacks robustness for complex geometries. In this work, we propose a robust and efficient differentiable collision detection framework that supports both convex and concave objects across diverse scales and configurations. Our method introduces distance-based first-order randomized smoothing, adaptive sampling, and equivalent gradient transport for robust and informative gradient computation. Experiments on complex meshes from DexGraspNet and Objaverse show significant improvements over existing baselines. Finally, we demonstrate a direct application of our method for dexterous grasp synthesis to refine the grasp quality. The code is available at https://github.com/JYChen18/DiffCollision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide soft robots with tactile sensing capabilities while preserving their structural flexibility, reducing damage risk, simplifying fabrication/maintenance, and avoiding the complexity of embedded sensors.

Method: Uses externally attachable photoreflective modules that read surface deformation patterns of compliant silicone skin to estimate contact forces, with the sensor located off the contact interface.

Result: Compression experiments show monotonic force output relationships, low hysteresis, high repeatability, and small response to indentation speeds. Successful integration on a soft robotic gripper reliably detects grasp events.

Conclusion: The modular optical sensing approach provides a practical and robust method to equip soft robots with force perception while maintaining structural flexibility, enhancing durability, reducing wiring complexity, and supporting deployment across diverse robot geometries.

Abstract: We present a tactile sensing method enabled by the mechanical compliance of soft robots; an externally attachable photoreflective module reads surface deformation of silicone skin to estimate contact force without embedding tactile transducers. Locating the sensor off the contact interface reduces damage risk, preserves softness, and simplifies fabrication and maintenance. We first characterize the optical sensing element and the compliant skin, thendetermine the design of a prototype tactile sensor. Compression experiments validate the approach, exhibiting a monotonic force output relationship consistent with theory, low hysteresis, high repeatability over repeated cycles, and small response indentation speeds. We further demonstrate integration on a soft robotic gripper, where the module reliably detects grasp events. Compared with liquid filled or wireembedded tactile skins, the proposed modular add on architecture enhances durability, reduces wiring complexity, and supports straightforward deployment across diverse robot geometries. Because the sensing principle reads skin strain patterns, it also suggests extensions to other somatosensory cues such as joint angle or actuator state estimation from surface deformation. Overall, leveraging surface compliance with an external optical module provides a practical and robust route to equip soft robots with force perception while preserving structural flexibility and manufacturability, paving the way for robotic applications and safe human robot collaboration.

Conclusion: The proposed Adaptive Humanoid Control (AHC) framework successfully enables humanoid robots to perform adaptive locomotion across different skills and terrains through multi-behavior distillation and reinforced fine-tuning.

Abstract: Humanoid robots are promising to learn a diverse set of human-like locomotion behaviors, including standing up, walking, running, and jumping. However, existing methods predominantly require training independent policies for each skill, yielding behavior-specific controllers that exhibit limited generalization and brittle performance when deployed on irregular terrains and in diverse situations. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Humanoid Control (AHC) that adopts a two-stage framework to learn an adaptive humanoid locomotion controller across different skills and terrains. Specifically, we first train several primary locomotion policies and perform a multi-behavior distillation process to obtain a basic multi-behavior controller, facilitating adaptive behavior switching based on the environment. Then, we perform reinforced fine-tuning by collecting online feedback in performing adaptive behaviors on more diverse terrains, enhancing terrain adaptability for the controller. We conduct experiments in both simulation and real-world experiments in Unitree G1 robots. The results show that our method exhibits strong adaptability across various situations and terrains.

Result: Extensive real-robot experiments show robust performance on various unknown objects, including those with varying center of mass, low-light conditions, and challenging visual backgrounds. Benchmarking on standard datasets demonstrates improved pose accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Visuo-tactile information enables robust and accurate pose tracking, allowing robots to perceive and interact with unseen complex articulated objects with revolute or prismatic joints.

Abstract: Robots operating in real-world environments frequently encounter unknown objects with complex structures and articulated components, such as doors, drawers, cabinets, and tools. The ability to perceive, track, and manipulate these objects without prior knowledge of their geometry or kinematic properties remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. In this work, we present a novel method for visuo-tactile-based tracking of unseen objects (single, multiple, or articulated) during robotic interaction without assuming any prior knowledge regarding object shape or dynamics. Our novel pose tracking approach termed ArtReg (stands for Articulated Registration) integrates visuo-tactile point clouds in an unscented Kalman Filter formulation in the SE(3) Lie Group for point cloud registration. ArtReg is used to detect possible articulated joints in objects using purposeful manipulation maneuvers such as pushing or hold-pulling with a two-robot team. Furthermore, we leverage ArtReg to develop a closed-loop controller for goal-driven manipulation of articulated objects to move the object into the desired pose configuration. We have extensively evaluated our approach on various types of unknown objects through real robot experiments. We also demonstrate the robustness of our method by evaluating objects with varying center of mass, low-light conditions, and with challenging visual backgrounds. Furthermore, we benchmarked our approach on a standard dataset of articulated objects and demonstrated improved performance in terms of pose accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our experiments indicate that robust and accurate pose tracking leveraging visuo-tactile information enables robots to perceive and interact with unseen complex articulated objects (with revolute or prismatic joints).

*Ralf Römer,Julian Balletshofer,Jakob Thumm,Marco Pavone,Angela P. Schoellig,Matthias Althoff*

TL;DR: PACS is a safety filtering method for diffusion policies that maintains task performance while providing formal safety guarantees through path-consistent braking and set-based reachability analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion policies achieve strong performance but lack safety guarantees, and external safety mechanisms disrupt training distribution causing unpredictable behavior and performance degradation.

Method: Path-consistent safety filtering with path-consistent braking on generated trajectories and set-based reachability analysis for real-time safety verification.

Result: PACS provides formal safety guarantees in dynamic environments, preserves task success rates, and outperforms reactive safety approaches by up to 68% in task success.

Conclusion: PACS enables safe deployment of diffusion policies while maintaining learned task-completing behavior, making it suitable for real-world human-robot interaction tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion policies (DPs) achieve state-of-the-art performance on complex manipulation tasks by learning from large-scale demonstration datasets, often spanning multiple embodiments and environments. However, they cannot guarantee safe behavior, so external safety mechanisms are needed. These, however, alter actions in ways unseen during training, causing unpredictable behavior and performance degradation. To address these problems, we propose path-consistent safety filtering (PACS) for DPs. Our approach performs path-consistent braking on a trajectory computed from the sequence of generated actions. In this way, we keep execution consistent with the policy's training distribution, maintaining the learned, task-completing behavior. To enable a real-time deployment and handle uncertainties, we verify safety using set-based reachability analysis. Our experimental evaluation in simulation and on three challenging real-world human-robot interaction tasks shows that PACS (a) provides formal safety guarantees in dynamic environments, (b) preserves task success rates, and (c) outperforms reactive safety approaches, such as control barrier functions, by up to 68% in terms of task success.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most wheeled bipedal robot research ignores leg dynamics, limiting motion potential, and robots struggle with uneven terrain traversal.

Method: Complete dynamics model incorporating closed-loop dynamics and ground contact model, LiDAR inertial odometry with improved PCA for terrain estimation, PD control and LQR for pose/balance control, hierarchical optimization for whole-body control.

Result: Validated terrain estimation algorithm performance and demonstrated robust traversal of uneven terrain through both simulation and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the limitations of simplified models and enables wheeled bipedal robots to effectively navigate challenging uneven terrain.

Abstract: Wheeled bipedal robots have garnered increasing attention in exploration and inspection. However, most research simplifies calculations by ignoring leg dynamics, thereby restricting the robot's full motion potential. Additionally, robots face challenges when traversing uneven terrain. To address the aforementioned issue, we develop a complete dynamics model and design a whole-body control framework with terrain estimation for a novel 6 degrees of freedom wheeled bipedal robot. This model incorporates the closed-loop dynamics of the robot and a ground contact model based on the estimated ground normal vector. We use a LiDAR inertial odometry framework and improved Principal Component Analysis for terrain estimation. Task controllers, including PD control law and LQR, are employed for pose control and centroidal dynamics-based balance control, respectively. Furthermore, a hierarchical optimization approach is used to solve the whole-body control problem. We validate the performance of the terrain estimation algorithm and demonstrate the algorithm's robustness and ability to traverse uneven terrain through both simulation and real-world experiments.

TL;DR: This chapter analyzes sim-to-real transfer challenges in bipedal locomotion DRL, identifies sources of simulation gap, and proposes two complementary solution approaches: improving simulator fidelity and hardening policies through robustness training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the critical challenge of simulation-to-reality transfer for deep reinforcement learning in bipedal locomotion, where the gap between simulation and real-world performance poses significant deployment barriers.

Method: Two complementary approaches: (1) model-centric strategies to improve simulator physical fidelity by addressing robot dynamics, contact modeling, state estimation, and numerical solvers; (2) policy hardening through in-simulation robustness training and post-deployment adaptation.

Result: A structured framework that diagnoses the 'curse of simulation' and provides systematic solutions to bridge the sim-to-real gap in bipedal locomotion control.

Conclusion: A strategic framework synthesizing both model improvement and policy hardening approaches offers a clear roadmap for developing and evaluating robust sim-to-real solutions in bipedal locomotion.

Abstract: This chapter addresses the critical challenge of simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) transfer for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in bipedal locomotion. After contextualizing the problem within various control architectures, we dissect the ``curse of simulation'' by analyzing the primary sources of sim-to-real gap: robot dynamics, contact modeling, state estimation, and numerical solvers. Building on this diagnosis, we structure the solutions around two complementary philosophies. The first is to shrink the gap through model-centric strategies that systematically improve the simulator's physical fidelity. The second is to harden the policy, a complementary approach that uses in-simulation robustness training and post-deployment adaptation to make the policy inherently resilient to model inaccuracies. The chapter concludes by synthesizing these philosophies into a strategic framework, providing a clear roadmap for developing and evaluating robust sim-to-real solutions.

### [244] [A Low-Rank Method for Vision Language Model Hallucination Mitigation in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06496)
*Keke Long,Jiacheng Guo,Tianyun Zhang,Hongkai Yu,Xiaopeng Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A self-contained low-rank approach to automatically rank VLM-generated captions by hallucination levels using only the captions themselves, achieving 87% accuracy in selecting hallucination-free captions and reducing inference time by 51-67% compared to debate methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs in autonomous driving produce hallucinations but detecting them is challenging without ground-truth references or model access. Need a practical method that works with only the generated captions.

Method: Construct sentence-embedding matrix from multiple VLM captions, decompose into low-rank consensus component and sparse residual, then use residual magnitude to rank captions (smallest residual = most hallucination-free).

Result: 87% selection accuracy for hallucination-free captions (19% improvement over baseline, 6-10% over multi-agent debate), strong correlation with human judgments, and 51-67% reduction in inference time.

Conclusion: The proposed low-rank approach effectively identifies hallucination-free VLM captions without external references or model access, making it practical for real-time autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used in autonomous driving to help understand traffic scenes, but they sometimes produce hallucinations, which are false details not grounded in the visual input. Detecting and mitigating hallucinations is challenging when ground-truth references are unavailable and model internals are inaccessible. This paper proposes a novel self-contained low-rank approach to automatically rank multiple candidate captions generated by multiple VLMs based on their hallucination levels, using only the captions themselves without requiring external references or model access. By constructing a sentence-embedding matrix and decomposing it into a low-rank consensus component and a sparse residual, we use the residual magnitude to rank captions: selecting the one with the smallest residual as the most hallucination-free. Experiments on the NuScenes dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves 87% selection accuracy in identifying hallucination-free captions, representing a 19% improvement over the unfiltered baseline and a 6-10% improvement over multi-agent debate method. The sorting produced by sparse error magnitudes shows strong correlation with human judgments of hallucinations, validating our scoring mechanism. Additionally, our method, which can be easily parallelized, reduces inference time by 51-67% compared to debate approaches, making it practical for real-time autonomous driving applications.

TL;DR: A hierarchical control framework combining meta-learning for PID initialization and reinforcement learning for online adaptation, with physics-based data augmentation to enable effective meta-learning with limited real robot data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual PID tuning for diverse robotic platforms is time-consuming and requires extensive domain expertise, necessitating automated approaches.

Method: Hierarchical control framework with meta-learning for PID initialization, reinforcement learning for online adaptation, and physics-based data augmentation by systematically perturbing physical parameters to generate virtual robot configurations.

Result: Achieved 16.6% average improvement on Franka Panda (6.26° MAE), with exceptional gains in high-load joints (J2: 80.4% improvement). Discovered optimization ceiling effect - RL provides dramatic improvements when meta-learning has localized high-error joints but no benefit when baseline performance is uniformly strong.

Conclusion: RL effectiveness depends on meta-learning baseline quality and error distribution, providing important design guidance for hierarchical control systems.

Abstract: Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers remain the predominant choice in industrial robotics due to their simplicity and reliability. However, manual tuning of PID parameters for diverse robotic platforms is time-consuming and requires extensive domain expertise. This paper presents a novel hierarchical control framework that combines meta-learning for PID initialization and reinforcement learning (RL) for online adaptation. To address the sample efficiency challenge, a \textit{physics-based data augmentation} strategy is introduced that generates virtual robot configurations by systematically perturbing physical parameters, enabling effective meta-learning with limited real robot data. The proposed approach is evaluated on two heterogeneous platforms: a 9-DOF Franka Panda manipulator and a 12-DOF Laikago quadruped robot. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 16.6\% average improvement on Franka Panda (6.26° MAE), with exceptional gains in high-load joints (J2: 80.4\% improvement from 12.36° to 2.42°). Critically, this work discovers the \textit{optimization ceiling effect}: RL achieves dramatic improvements when meta-learning exhibits localized high-error joints, but provides no benefit (0.0\%) when baseline performance is uniformly strong, as observed in Laikago. The method demonstrates robust performance under disturbances (parameter uncertainty: +19.2\%, no disturbance: +16.6\%, average: +10.0\%) with only 10 minutes of training time. Multi-seed analysis across 100 random initializations confirms stable performance (4.81+/-1.64\% average). These results establish that RL effectiveness is highly dependent on meta-learning baseline quality and error distribution, providing important design guidance for hierarchical control systems.

*Cormac O'Neill,Jasmine Terrones,H. Harry Asada*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a method using Koopman operators to transform the non-convex control problem of robots making and breaking contact with their environment into a globally-linear model, enabling convex Model Predictive Control for real-time robot control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controlling robots during dynamic contact interactions is challenging due to switching dynamics at contact boundaries, which creates non-convex optimization problems for predictive controllers.

Method: Apply Koopman operators to subsume segmented dynamics from contact changes into a unified, globally-linear model in an embedding space, leveraging viscoelastic contact properties to enable exact control input representation.

Result: The method enables convex Model Predictive Control of a legged robot and real-time control of a manipulator performing dynamic pushing, allowing robots to discover elaborate control strategies with multiple contact changes in real-time.

Conclusion: The Koopman operator approach successfully overcomes contact-induced non-convexity in robot control, is applicable to broad fields beyond robotics, and enables real-time control over time horizons with multiple contact changes.

Abstract: Controlling robots that dynamically engage in contact with their environment is a pressing challenge. Whether a legged robot making-and-breaking contact with a floor, or a manipulator grasping objects, contact is everywhere. Unfortunately, the switching of dynamics at contact boundaries makes control difficult. Predictive controllers face non-convex optimization problems when contact is involved. Here, we overcome this difficulty by applying Koopman operators to subsume the segmented dynamics due to contact changes into a unified, globally-linear model in an embedding space. We show that viscoelastic contact at robot-environment interactions underpins the use of Koopman operators without approximation to control inputs. This methodology enables the convex Model Predictive Control of a legged robot, and the real-time control of a manipulator engaged in dynamic pushing. In this work, we show that our method allows robots to discover elaborate control strategies in real-time over time horizons with multiple contact changes, and the method is applicable to broad fields beyond robotics.

### [247] [CoFineLLM: Conformal Finetuning of LLMs for Language-Instructed Robot Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06575)
*Jun Wang,Yevgeniy Vorobeychik,Yiannis Kantaros*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CoFineLLM is a conformal prediction-aware finetuning framework that reduces prediction set sizes in LLM-based planners, decreasing human intervention needs while maintaining plan correctness guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based planners often produce overconfident but wrong outputs in long-horizon tasks, and while conformal prediction helps ensure correctness, it leads to unnecessarily large prediction sets requiring frequent human help.

Method: Conformal finetuning framework (CoFineLLM) that explicitly trains LLMs to be aware of prediction sets, reducing set sizes while maintaining coverage guarantees through CP-aware optimization.

Result: Consistent improvements over baselines in prediction-set size and help rates across multiple language-instructed robot planning problems, with demonstrated robustness to out-of-distribution scenarios in hardware experiments.

Conclusion: CoFineLLM successfully reduces the need for human interventions in LLM-based planners while preserving correctness guarantees, enabling more autonomous deployment of language-instructed agents.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as planners for language-instructed agents, generating sequences of actions to accomplish natural language tasks. However, their reliability remains a challenge, especially in long-horizon tasks, since they often produce overconfident yet wrong outputs. Conformal Prediction (CP) has been leveraged to address this issue by wrapping LLM outputs into prediction sets that contain the correct action with a user-defined confidence. When the prediction set is a singleton, the planner executes that action; otherwise, it requests help from a user. This has led to LLM-based planners that can ensure plan correctness with a user-defined probability. However, as LLMs are trained in an uncertainty-agnostic manner, without awareness of prediction sets, they tend to produce unnecessarily large sets, particularly at higher confidence levels, resulting in frequent human interventions limiting autonomous deployment. To address this, we introduce CoFineLLM (Conformal Finetuning for LLMs), the first CP-aware finetuning framework for LLM-based planners that explicitly reduces prediction-set size and, in turn, the need for user interventions. We evaluate our approach on multiple language-instructed robot planning problems and show consistent improvements over uncertainty-aware and uncertainty-agnostic finetuning baselines in terms of prediction-set size, and help rates. Finally, we demonstrate robustness of our method to out-of-distribution scenarios in hardware experiments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces GrinningFace, a diagnostic benchmark using emoji tabletop manipulation to test how vision-language-action models transfer knowledge from vision-language models to embodied control, revealing that preserving VLM priors is crucial for generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how vision-language-action models effectively inherit prior knowledge from large vision-language models for generalizable embodied control, given that emoji knowledge exists in VLM training data but is absent from robotics datasets.

Method: Created GrinningFace benchmark with emoji tabletop manipulation tasks, implemented in simulation and real robots, and systematically evaluated various knowledge transfer techniques including parameter-efficient fine-tuning, VLM freezing, co-training, and different action prediction methods.

Result: The diagnostic task revealed that successful completion indicates effective transfer of VLM priors, and systematic evaluation showed the critical importance of preserving VLM priors for VLA generalization.

Conclusion: Preserving VLM priors is essential for generalization in embodied AI systems, and the work establishes guidelines for developing truly generalizable embodied AI systems.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models hold the promise to attain generalizable embodied control. To achieve this, a pervasive paradigm is to leverage the rich vision-semantic priors of large vision-language models (VLMs). However, the fundamental question persists: How do VLAs effectively inherit the prior knowledge from VLMs? To address this critical question, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark, GrinningFace, an emoji tabletop manipulation task where the robot arm is asked to place objects onto printed emojis corresponding to language instructions. This task design is particularly revealing -- knowledge associated with emojis is ubiquitous in Internet-scale datasets used for VLM pre-training, yet emojis themselves are largely absent from standard robotics datasets. Consequently, they provide a clean proxy: successful task completion indicates effective transfer of VLM priors to embodied control. We implement this diagnostic task in both simulated environment and a real robot, and compare various promising techniques for knowledge transfer. Specifically, we investigate the effects of parameter-efficient fine-tuning, VLM freezing, co-training, predicting discretized actions, and predicting latent actions. Through systematic evaluation, our work not only demonstrates the critical importance of preserving VLM priors for the generalization of VLA but also establishes guidelines for future research in developing truly generalizable embodied AI systems.

*Andrew Choi,Dezhong Tong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Rapid soft robot policy learning is achievable through implicit time-stepping with DisMech simulator, achieving up to 40x speedup in contact-rich scenarios while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft robotic simulation frameworks are scarce and computationally expensive, making policy learning infeasible compared to rigid-body simulators.

Method: Use DisMech, a general-purpose implicit soft-body simulator, with delta natural curvature control for intuitive soft robot control, comparing against Elastica framework.

Result: Implicit time-stepping achieves 6x faster speeds for non-contact cases and 40x faster for contact-rich scenarios, with no accuracy loss in sim-to-sim transfer.

Conclusion: Implicit time-stepping provides dramatic speedups without sacrificing accuracy, making rapid soft robot policy learning feasible.

Abstract: With the explosive growth of rigid-body simulators, policy learning in simulation has become the de facto standard for most rigid morphologies. In contrast, soft robotic simulation frameworks remain scarce and are seldom adopted by the soft robotics community. This gap stems partly from the lack of easy-to-use, general-purpose frameworks and partly from the high computational cost of accurately simulating continuum mechanics, which often renders policy learning infeasible. In this work, we demonstrate that rapid soft robot policy learning is indeed achievable via implicit time-stepping. Our simulator of choice, DisMech, is a general-purpose, fully implicit soft-body simulator capable of handling both soft dynamics and frictional contact. We further introduce delta natural curvature control, a method analogous to delta joint position control in rigid manipulators, providing an intuitive and effective means of enacting control for soft robot learning. To highlight the benefits of implicit time-stepping and delta curvature control, we conduct extensive comparisons across four diverse soft manipulator tasks against one of the most widely used soft-body frameworks, Elastica. With implicit time-stepping, parallel stepping of 500 environments achieves up to 6x faster speeds for non-contact cases and up to 40x faster for contact-rich scenarios. Finally, a comprehensive sim-to-sim gap evaluation--training policies in one simulator and evaluating them in another--demonstrates that implicit time-stepping provides a rare free lunch: dramatic speedups achieved without sacrificing accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the curse of dimensionality in soft robotics design and create tractable, modular systems that harness the behavioral freeform of soft structures for rich embodied behaviors.

Method: Developed a parametric geometry generator to customize actuator models from high-level inputs, and conducted semi-automated experimentation with systematic exploration of key parameters to characterize extension/bending, expansion, and stiffness.

Result: Revealed clear relationships between key design parameters and performance, and demonstrated application in a deployable soft quadruped whose legs deploy to walk, enabling automatic adaptation to confined spaces.

Conclusion: PTSPAs present a new design paradigm for deployable and shape morphing structures wherever large length changes are required.

Abstract: Soft Robotics presents a rich canvas for free-form and continuum devices capable of exerting forces in any direction and transforming between arbitrary configurations. However, there is no current way to tractably and directly exploit the design freedom due to the curse of dimensionality. Parameterisable sets of designs offer a pathway towards tractable, modular soft robotics that appropriately harness the behavioural freeform of soft structures to create rich embodied behaviours. In this work, we present a parametrised class of soft actuators, Programmable Telescopic Soft Pneumatic Actuators (PTSPAs). PTSPAs expand axially on inflation for deployable structures and manipulation in challenging confined spaces. We introduce a parametric geometry generator to customise actuator models from high-level inputs, and explore the new design space through semi-automated experimentation and systematic exploration of key parameters. Using it we characterise the actuators' extension/bending, expansion, and stiffness and reveal clear relationships between key design parameters and performance. Finally we demonstrate the application of the actuators in a deployable soft quadruped whose legs deploy to walk, enabling automatic adaptation to confined spaces. PTSPAs present new design paradigm for deployable and shape morphing structures and wherever large length changes are required.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like RIG generate physically implausible goals that hinder learning efficiency, creating a need for goal generation that respects physical constraints.

Method: Enhanced Physics-Informed Variational Autoencoder (Enhanced p3-VAE) that separates latent space into physics variables and environmental factors, enforcing physical consistency through differential equations and conservation laws.

Result: Physics-informed goal generation significantly improves goal quality, leading to more effective exploration and better skill acquisition in reaching, pushing, and pick-and-place tasks.

Conclusion: Integrating physical constraints directly into goal generation enables robots to propose feasible and diverse goals, accelerating autonomous skill acquisition in visual robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Self-supervised goal-conditioned reinforcement learning enables robots to autonomously acquire diverse skills without human supervision. However, a central challenge is the goal setting problem: robots must propose feasible and diverse goals that are achievable in their current environment. Existing methods like RIG (Visual Reinforcement Learning with Imagined Goals) use variational autoencoder (VAE) to generate goals in a learned latent space but have the limitation of producing physically implausible goals that hinder learning efficiency. We propose Physics-Informed RIG (PI-RIG), which integrates physical constraints directly into the VAE training process through a novel Enhanced Physics-Informed Variational Autoencoder (Enhanced p3-VAE), enabling the generation of physically consistent and achievable goals. Our key innovation is the explicit separation of the latent space into physics variables governing object dynamics and environmental factors capturing visual appearance, while enforcing physical consistency through differential equation constraints and conservation laws. This enables the generation of physically consistent and achievable goals that respect fundamental physical principles such as object permanence, collision constraints, and dynamic feasibility. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that this physics-informed goal generation significantly improves the quality of proposed goals, leading to more effective exploration and better skill acquisition in visual robotic manipulation tasks including reaching, pushing, and pick-and-place scenarios.

TL;DR: Proposes a semi-distributed cross-modal air-ground relative localization framework that decouples relative localization from state estimation, using deep learning-based keypoints and descriptors to achieve efficient communication under 0.3 Mbps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-robot SLAM approaches are tightly coupled with state estimation, limiting flexibility and accuracy in air-ground collaborative tasks where different sensor configurations exist.

Method: UGV performs local Bundle Adjustment with LiDAR, camera, and IMU in two stages: first optimizing camera poses from LiDAR-Inertial Odometry, then estimating relative poses between UGV and UAV. Uses deep learning-based keypoints and descriptors with incremental loop closure detection.

Result: Achieves outstanding accuracy and efficiency while constraining communication bandwidth under 0.3 Mbps, outperforming traditional approaches that transmit images or point clouds.

Conclusion: The semi-distributed framework successfully decouples relative localization from state estimation, providing an efficient and flexible solution for air-ground collaborative tasks with minimal communication requirements.

Abstract: Efficient, accurate, and flexible relative localization is crucial in air-ground collaborative tasks. However, current approaches for robot relative localization are primarily realized in the form of distributed multi-robot SLAM systems with the same sensor configuration, which are tightly coupled with the state estimation of all robots, limiting both flexibility and accuracy. To this end, we fully leverage the high capacity of Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) to integrate multiple sensors, enabling a semi-distributed cross-modal air-ground relative localization framework. In this work, both the UGV and the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) independently perform SLAM while extracting deep learning-based keypoints and global descriptors, which decouples the relative localization from the state estimation of all agents. The UGV employs a local Bundle Adjustment (BA) with LiDAR, camera, and an IMU to rapidly obtain accurate relative pose estimates. The BA process adopts sparse keypoint optimization and is divided into two stages: First, optimizing camera poses interpolated from LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO), followed by estimating the relative camera poses between the UGV and UAV. Additionally, we implement an incremental loop closure detection algorithm using deep learning-based descriptors to maintain and retrieve keyframes efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves outstanding performance in both accuracy and efficiency. Unlike traditional multi-robot SLAM approaches that transmit images or point clouds, our method only transmits keypoint pixels and their descriptors, effectively constraining the communication bandwidth under 0.3 Mbps.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LIBERO+ benchmark dataset and SlotVLA framework for object-relation-centric robotic manipulation, showing that compact object-centric representations can achieve competitive generalization with fewer visual tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of dense embeddings in existing robotic multitask models that entangle object and background cues, which raises efficiency and interpretability concerns. The work is inspired by how humans reason over discrete objects and their relationships.

Method: Two main contributions: 1) LIBERO+ dataset with fine-grained object-centric annotations including box/mask-level labels and instance-level temporal tracking; 2) SlotVLA framework using slot-attention for consistent temporal object representations, relation-centric decoder for task-relevant embeddings, and LLM-driven module for action translation.

Result: Experiments on LIBERO+ show that object-centric slot and object-relation slot representations drastically reduce the number of required visual tokens while maintaining competitive generalization performance.

Conclusion: LIBERO+ and SlotVLA together provide a compact, interpretable, and effective foundation for advancing object-relation-centric robotic manipulation, demonstrating the viability of structured representations for visuomotor control.

Abstract: Inspired by how humans reason over discrete objects and their relationships, we explore whether compact object-centric and object-relation representations can form a foundation for multitask robotic manipulation. Most existing robotic multitask models rely on dense embeddings that entangle both object and background cues, raising concerns about both efficiency and interpretability. In contrast, we study object-relation-centric representations as a pathway to more structured, efficient, and explainable visuomotor control. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we introduce LIBERO+, a fine-grained benchmark dataset designed to enable and evaluate object-relation reasoning in robotic manipulation. Unlike prior datasets, LIBERO+ provides object-centric annotations that enrich demonstrations with box- and mask-level labels as well as instance-level temporal tracking, supporting compact and interpretable visuomotor representations. Second, we propose SlotVLA, a slot-attention-based framework that captures both objects and their relations for action decoding. It uses a slot-based visual tokenizer to maintain consistent temporal object representations, a relation-centric decoder to produce task-relevant embeddings, and an LLM-driven module that translates these embeddings into executable actions. Experiments on LIBERO+ demonstrate that object-centric slot and object-relation slot representations drastically reduce the number of required visual tokens, while providing competitive generalization. Together, LIBERO+ and SlotVLA provide a compact, interpretable, and effective foundation for advancing object-relation-centric robotic manipulation.

### [255] [Human-Level Actuation for Humanoids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06796)
*MD-Nazmus Sunbeam*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A framework to quantify "human-level" actuation in robots using standardized joint comparisons, human-equivalence envelopes, and a comprehensive scoring system that considers multiple physical factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current claims of "human-level" robot actuation are vague and unquantified, with peak specifications failing to capture real-world performance requirements across different tasks and postures.

Method: Three-component framework: 1) DoF atlas for standardized joint coordinate systems, 2) Human-Equivalence Envelopes to measure torque and power requirements at specific joint angles and rates, 3) Human-Level Actuation Score aggregating six physical factors including workspace coverage, bandwidth, efficiency, and thermal sustainability.

Result: The framework enables measurable comparison of actuation systems across different robots and provides detailed protocols for reproducible testing, exposing trade-offs that peak specifications miss.

Conclusion: This comprehensive framework serves as both a design specification for humanoid development and a benchmarking standard for comparing actuation systems, grounded in established human biomechanics data.

Abstract: Claims that humanoid robots achieve ``human-level'' actuation are common but rarely quantified. Peak torque or speed specifications tell us little about whether a joint can deliver the right combination of torque, power, and endurance at task-relevant postures and rates. We introduce a comprehensive framework that makes ``human-level'' measurable and comparable across systems. Our approach has three components. First, a kinematic \emph{DoF atlas} standardizes joint coordinate systems and ranges of motion using ISB-based conventions, ensuring that human and robot joints are compared in the same reference frames. Second, \emph{Human-Equivalence Envelopes (HEE)} define per-joint requirements by measuring whether a robot meets human torque \emph{and} power simultaneously at the same joint angle and rate $(q,ω)$, weighted by positive mechanical work in task-specific bands (walking, stairs, lifting, reaching, and hand actions). Third, the \emph{Human-Level Actuation Score (HLAS)} aggregates six physically grounded factors: workspace coverage (ROM and DoF), HEE coverage, torque-mode bandwidth, efficiency, and thermal sustainability. We provide detailed measurement protocols using dynamometry, electrical power monitoring, and thermal testing that yield every HLAS input from reproducible experiments. A worked example demonstrates HLAS computation for a multi-joint humanoid, showing how the score exposes actuator trade-offs (gearing ratio versus bandwidth and efficiency) that peak-torque specifications obscure. The framework serves as both a design specification for humanoid development and a benchmarking standard for comparing actuation systems, with all components grounded in published human biomechanics data.

### [256] [Vision-Aided Online A* Path Planning for Efficient and Safe Navigation of Service Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06801)
*Praveen Kumar,Tushar Sandhan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework that integrates lightweight semantic segmentation with real-time path planning to enable context-aware navigation for low-cost autonomous robots, allowing them to distinguish and avoid user-defined important objects like documents or safety lines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional navigation systems using LiDAR are geometrically precise but semantically unaware - they can't distinguish important objects from harmless ones, treating both as traversable. This creates a critical gap for deploying autonomous service robots in human-centric environments.

Method: The approach integrates a lightweight perception module with an online A* planner. The perception system uses semantic segmentation to identify user-defined visual constraints, which are projected as non-geometric obstacles onto a continuously updated global map, enabling navigation based on contextual importance rather than just physical size.

Result: Extensive experiments in high-fidelity simulations and real-world robotic platforms demonstrate robust, real-time performance, proving that cost-effective robots can safely navigate complex environments while respecting critical visual cues invisible to traditional planners.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the gap between semantic perception and real-time path planning, enabling affordable robotic platforms to perform context-aware navigation that respects user-defined important objects in both known and unknown environments.

Abstract: The deployment of autonomous service robots in human-centric environments is hindered by a critical gap in perception and planning. Traditional navigation systems rely on expensive LiDARs that, while geometrically precise, are seman- tically unaware, they cannot distinguish a important document on an office floor from a harmless piece of litter, treating both as physically traversable. While advanced semantic segmentation exists, no prior work has successfully integrated this visual intelligence into a real-time path planner that is efficient enough for low-cost, embedded hardware. This paper presents a frame- work to bridge this gap, delivering context-aware navigation on an affordable robotic platform. Our approach centers on a novel, tight integration of a lightweight perception module with an online A* planner. The perception system employs a semantic segmentation model to identify user-defined visual constraints, enabling the robot to navigate based on contextual importance rather than physical size alone. This adaptability allows an operator to define what is critical for a given task, be it sensitive papers in an office or safety lines in a factory, thus resolving the ambiguity of what to avoid. This semantic perception is seamlessly fused with geometric data. The identified visual constraints are projected as non-geometric obstacles onto a global map that is continuously updated from sensor data, enabling robust navigation through both partially known and unknown environments. We validate our framework through extensive experiments in high-fidelity simulations and on a real-world robotic platform. The results demonstrate robust, real-time performance, proving that a cost- effective robot can safely navigate complex environments while respecting critical visual cues invisible to traditional planners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional road-situation detection methods fail in unseen cases and lack semantic interpretation needed for reliable traffic recommendations, motivating the development of a more intelligent framework.

Method: Multi-agent AI framework that processes camera feeds using multimodal LLMs (Gemini models) with dedicated agents for situation detection, distance estimation, decision-making, and C-ITS message generation.

Result: 100% recall in situation detection and perfect message schema correctness, but both models suffer from false-positive detections and reduced performance in lane details, driving status, and cause codes. Gemini-2.5-Flash underperforms Gemini-2.0-Flash despite being more capable.

Conclusion: Findings motivate further work on fine-tuning specialized LLMs or MLLMs tailored for intelligent transportation applications to improve detection accuracy and semantic understanding.

Abstract: Conventional road-situation detection methods achieve strong performance in predefined scenarios but fail in unseen cases and lack semantic interpretation, which is crucial for reliable traffic recommendations. This work introduces a multi-agent AI framework that combines multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with vision-based perception for road-situation monitoring. The framework processes camera feeds and coordinates dedicated agents for situation detection, distance estimation, decision-making, and Cooperative Intelligent Transport System (C-ITS) message generation. Evaluation is conducted on a custom dataset of 103 images extracted from 20 videos of the TAD dataset. Both Gemini-2.0-Flash and Gemini-2.5-Flash were evaluated. The results show 100\% recall in situation detection and perfect message schema correctness; however, both models suffer from false-positive detections and have reduced performance in terms of number of lanes, driving lane status and cause code. Surprisingly, Gemini-2.5-Flash, though more capable in general tasks, underperforms Gemini-2.0-Flash in detection accuracy and semantic understanding and incurs higher latency (Table II). These findings motivate further work on fine-tuning specialized LLMs or MLLMs tailored for intelligent transportation applications.

Method: A framework that integrates visual SLAM with a lateral vehicle dynamics model to achieve online gyroscope calibration under realistic driving conditions.

Result: Vision-based integration significantly improves gyroscope calibration accuracy and enhances overall localization performance, showing superior accuracy on public benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed visual SLAM integration with vehicle dynamics provides a promising path toward higher automotive localization accuracy, demonstrating improved performance over traditional sensor-based approaches.

Abstract: Accurate ego-motion estimation in consumer-grade vehicles currently relies on proprioceptive sensors, i.e. wheel odometry and IMUs, whose performance is limited by systematic errors and calibration. While visual-inertial SLAM has become a standard in robotics, its integration into automotive ego-motion estimation remains largely unexplored. This paper investigates how visual SLAM can be integrated into consumer-grade vehicle localization systems to improve performance. We propose a framework that fuses visual SLAM with a lateral vehicle dynamics model to achieve online gyroscope calibration under realistic driving conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that vision-based integration significantly improves gyroscope calibration accuracy and thus enhances overall localization performance, highlighting a promising path toward higher automotive localization accuracy. We provide results on both proprietary and public datasets, showing improved performance and superior localization accuracy on a public benchmark compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater positioning is challenging because GNSS signals cannot penetrate water, creating a need for accessible and affordable positioning solutions for underwater robotics research.

Method: The system uses a modular hardware architecture with hydrophone array, preamplifier, OCXO, Raspberry Pi 5, and DAQ board for the receiver, plus beacon components. It employs C++ software for clock synchronization, OWTT messaging, and real-time signal processing including matched filtering, beamforming, and adaptive gain control.

Conclusion: Low-cost, reproducible hardware can achieve research-grade underwater positioning accuracy, and the open-source platform lowers entry barriers for underwater robotics research while promoting collaboration and innovation.

Abstract: Precise underwater positioning remains a fundamental challenge for underwater robotics since global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals cannot penetrate the sea surface. This paper presents Raspi$^2$USBL, an open-source, Raspberry Pi-based passive inverted ultra-short baseline (piUSBL) positioning system designed to provide a low-cost and accessible solution for underwater robotic research. The system comprises a passive acoustic receiver and an active beacon. The receiver adopts a modular hardware architecture that integrates a hydrophone array, a multichannel preamplifier, an oven-controlled crystal oscillator (OCXO), a Raspberry Pi 5, and an MCC-series data acquisition (DAQ) board. Apart from the Pi 5, OCXO, and MCC board, the beacon comprises an impedance-matching network, a power amplifier, and a transmitting transducer. An open-source C++ software framework provides high-precision clock synchronization and triggering for one-way travel-time (OWTT) messaging, while performing real-time signal processing, including matched filtering, array beamforming, and adaptive gain control, to estimate the time of flight (TOF) and direction of arrival (DOA) of received signals. The Raspi$^2$USBL system was experimentally validated in an anechoic tank, freshwater lake, and open-sea trials. Results demonstrate a slant-range accuracy better than 0.1%, a bearing accuracy within 0.1$^\circ$, and stable performance over operational distances up to 1.3 km. These findings confirm that low-cost, reproducible hardware can deliver research-grade underwater positioning accuracy. By releasing both the hardware and software as open-source, Raspi$^2$USBL provides a unified reference platform that lowers the entry barrier for underwater robotics laboratories, fosters reproducibility, and promotes collaborative innovation in underwater acoustic navigation and swarm robotics.

Conclusion: HDCNet effectively addresses depth perception challenges for transparent/reflective objects and significantly improves robotic manipulation capabilities through its hybrid architecture design.

Abstract: Depth perception of transparent and reflective objects has long been a critical challenge in robotic manipulation.Conventional depth sensors often fail to provide reliable measurements on such surfaces, limiting the performance of robots in perception and grasping tasks. To address this issue, we propose a novel depth completion network,HDCNet,which integrates the complementary strengths of Transformer,CNN and Mamba architectures.Specifically,the encoder is designed as a dual-branch Transformer-CNN framework to extract modality-specific features. At the shallow layers of the encoder, we introduce a lightweight multimodal fusion module to effectively integrate low-level features. At the network bottleneck,a Transformer-Mamba hybrid fusion module is developed to achieve deep integration of high-level semantic and global contextual information, significantly enhancing depth completion accuracy and robustness. Extensive evaluations on multiple public datasets demonstrate that HDCNet achieves state-of-the-art(SOTA) performance in depth completion tasks.Furthermore,robotic grasping experiments show that HDCNet substantially improves grasp success rates for transparent and reflective objects,achieving up to a 60% increase.

*Thomas Steinecker,Alexander Bienemann,Denis Trescher,Thorsten Luettel,Mirko Maehlisch*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A framework for zero-shot transfer of RL-based motion planning from simulation to reality by decoupling planning from control through spatial-temporal alignment between virtual and real vehicles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world vehicle deployment of RL is challenging due to complex dynamics and sim-to-real gap from factors like tire characteristics, road conditions, and aerodynamic effects.

Method: Train RL agent in simulation using kinematic bicycle model, distill behavior into trajectory-predicting agent, then deploy with Stanley controller for lateral dynamics and adaptive updates for longitudinal alignment.

Result: Validated on real vehicle, enabling robust zero-shot transfer of RL-based motion planning by decoupling high-level trajectory generation from low-level control.

Conclusion: The proposed alignment strategy successfully enables simulation-to-reality transfer for RL in vehicle control by separating motion planning from vehicle control.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in robotics, but deploying RL on real vehicles remains challenging due to the complexity of vehicle dynamics and the mismatch between simulation and reality. Factors such as tire characteristics, road surface conditions, aerodynamic disturbances, and vehicle load make it infeasible to model real-world dynamics accurately, which hinders direct transfer of RL agents trained in simulation. In this paper, we present a framework that decouples motion planning from vehicle control through a spatial and temporal alignment strategy between a virtual vehicle and the real system. An RL agent is first trained in simulation using a kinematic bicycle model to output continuous control actions. Its behavior is then distilled into a trajectory-predicting agent that generates finite-horizon ego-vehicle trajectories, enabling synchronization between virtual and real vehicles. At deployment, a Stanley controller governs lateral dynamics, while longitudinal alignment is maintained through adaptive update mechanisms that compensate for deviations between virtual and real trajectories. We validate our approach on a real vehicle and demonstrate that the proposed alignment strategy enables robust zero-shot transfer of RL-based motion planning from simulation to reality, successfully decoupling high-level trajectory generation from low-level vehicle control.

TL;DR: Automated continuous-space roadmap generation for mobile robot fleets in intralogistics that integrates transport demand and minimum distance constraints, outperforming grid-based and random sampling approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing roadmap approaches for mobile robot routing in intralogistics either use grid-based methods that compromise geometric precision or continuous-space methods that ignore practical constraints like transport demand and minimum distances, leading to inefficiencies and deadlocks.

Method: Combines free space discretization, transport demand-driven K-shortest-path optimization, and path smoothing to generate roadmaps that integrate station-to-station transport demand while enforcing minimum distance constraints for nodes and edges.

Result: Evaluation across multiple intralogistics use cases shows the approach consistently outperforms 4-connected grid, 8-connected grid, and random sampling baselines, achieving lower structural complexity, higher redundancy, and near-optimal path lengths.

Conclusion: The proposed automated roadmap generation enables efficient and robust routing of mobile robot fleets by bridging the gap between geometric precision and practical constraints in intralogistics applications.

Abstract: Efficient routing of mobile robot fleets is crucial in intralogistics, where delays and deadlocks can substantially reduce system throughput. Roadmap design, specifying feasible transport routes, directly affects fleet coordination and computational performance. Existing approaches are either grid-based, compromising geometric precision, or continuous-space approaches that disregard practical constraints. This paper presents an automated roadmap generation approach that bridges this gap by operating in continuous-space, integrating station-to-station transport demand and enforcing minimum distance constraints for nodes and edges. By combining free space discretization, transport demand-driven $K$-shortest-path optimization, and path smoothing, the approach produces roadmaps tailored to intralogistics applications. Evaluation across multiple intralogistics use cases demonstrates that the proposed approach consistently outperforms established baselines (4-connected grid, 8-connected grid, and random sampling), achieving lower structural complexity, higher redundancy, and near-optimal path lengths, enabling efficient and robust routing of mobile robot fleets.

### [264] [Robotic versus Human Teleoperation for Remote Ultrasound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07275)
*David Black,Septimiu Salcudean*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper compares human teleoperation vs robotic teleoperation for tele-ultrasound, finding human teleoperation performs comparably in time and accuracy while being more practical and accessible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the shortage of ultrasound expertise in rural areas by comparing tele-ultrasound approaches to determine if lower-cost human teleoperation can match robotic performance.

Method: Comparative evaluation of human vs robotic teleoperation examining setup time, flexibility, completion time, position tracking accuracy, and force consistency.

Result: Human teleoperation showed no statistically significant differences in completion time (1.8% mean difference) or position accuracy (0.5% mean difference), with more consistent force application.

Conclusion: Human teleoperation provides comparable performance to robotic teleoperation while being substantially more practical and accessible for rural healthcare settings.

Abstract: Diagnostic medical ultrasound is widely used, safe, and relatively low cost but requires a high degree of expertise to acquire and interpret the images. Personnel with this expertise are often not available outside of larger cities, leading to difficult, costly travel and long wait times for rural populations. To address this issue, tele-ultrasound techniques are being developed, including robotic teleoperation and recently human teleoperation, in which a novice user is remotely guided in a hand-over-hand manner through mixed reality to perform an ultrasound exam. These methods have not been compared, and their relative strengths are unknown. Human teleoperation may be more practical than robotics for small communities due to its lower cost and complexity, but this is only relevant if the performance is comparable. This paper therefore evaluates the differences between human and robotic teleoperation, examining practical aspects such as setup time and flexibility and experimentally comparing performance metrics such as completion time, position tracking, and force consistency. It is found that human teleoperation does not lead to statistically significant differences in completion time or position accuracy, with mean differences of 1.8% and 0.5%, respectively, and provides more consistent force application despite being substantially more practical and accessible.

TL;DR: PlanT 2.0 is a lightweight object-centric planning transformer for autonomous driving that achieves SOTA performance on CARLA benchmarks while enabling systematic failure analysis through controlled input perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous driving research prioritizes benchmark performance over understanding model failures, biases, and shortcut learning, leading to incremental improvements without deep failure analysis.

Method: Introduces PlanT 2.0, an object-centric planning transformer that enables controlled analysis through input perturbations (changing object locations, adding/removing objects) and includes multiple upgrades for CARLA Leaderboard 2.0 scenarios.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Longest6 v2, Bench2Drive, and CARLA validation routes, while exposing failures like lack of scene understanding due to low obstacle diversity, rigid expert behaviors creating exploitable shortcuts, and overfitting to fixed expert trajectories.

Conclusion: Argues for a shift toward data-centric development with focus on richer, more robust, and less biased datasets, and open-sources the code and model.

Abstract: Most recent work in autonomous driving has prioritized benchmark performance and methodological innovation over in-depth analysis of model failures, biases, and shortcut learning. This has led to incremental improvements without a deep understanding of the current failures. While it is straightforward to look at situations where the model fails, it is hard to understand the underlying reason. This motivates us to conduct a systematic study, where inputs to the model are perturbed and the predictions observed. We introduce PlanT 2.0, a lightweight, object-centric planning transformer designed for autonomous driving research in CARLA. The object-level representation enables controlled analysis, as the input can be easily perturbed (e.g., by changing the location or adding or removing certain objects), in contrast to sensor-based models. To tackle the scenarios newly introduced by the challenging CARLA Leaderboard 2.0, we introduce multiple upgrades to PlanT, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Longest6 v2, Bench2Drive, and the CARLA validation routes. Our analysis exposes insightful failures, such as a lack of scene understanding caused by low obstacle diversity, rigid expert behaviors leading to exploitable shortcuts, and overfitting to a fixed set of expert trajectories. Based on these findings, we argue for a shift toward data-centric development, with a focus on richer, more robust, and less biased datasets. We open-source our code and model at https://github.com/autonomousvision/plant2.

*Yizhe Zhu,Zhang Ye,Boce Hu,Haibo Zhao,Yu Qi,Dian Wang,Robert Platt*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: EquiTac is a visuotactile policy learning framework that uses SO(2) symmetry to improve sample efficiency and generalization for in-hand object rotation tasks, achieving robust zero-shot generalization with minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost of tactile data collection makes sample efficiency crucial for developing visuotactile policies, especially for contact-rich manipulation tasks.

Method: Reconstructs surface normals from RGB tactile sensor inputs and uses an SO(2)-equivariant network to predict residual rotation actions that augment a base visuomotor policy, enabling real-time rotation correction without additional demonstrations.

Result: Achieves robust zero-shot generalization to unseen in-hand orientations with very few training samples, outperforming baselines that fail even with more data.

Conclusion: First tactile learning method to explicitly encode tactile equivariance for policy learning, providing a lightweight, symmetry-aware module that improves reliability in contact-rich tasks.

Abstract: Visuotactile policy learning augments vision-only policies with tactile input, facilitating contact-rich manipulation. However, the high cost of tactile data collection makes sample efficiency the key requirement for developing visuotactile policies. We present EquiTac, a framework that exploits the inherent SO(2) symmetry of in-hand object rotation to improve sample efficiency and generalization for visuotactile policy learning. EquiTac first reconstructs surface normals from raw RGB inputs of vision-based tactile sensors, so rotations of the normal vector field correspond to in-hand object rotations. An SO(2)-equivariant network then predicts a residual rotation action that augments a base visuomotor policy at test time, enabling real-time rotation correction without additional reorientation demonstrations. On a real robot, EquiTac accurately achieves robust zero-shot generalization to unseen in-hand orientations with very few training samples, where baselines fail even with more training data. To our knowledge, this is the first tactile learning method to explicitly encode tactile equivariance for policy learning, yielding a lightweight, symmetry-aware module that improves reliability in contact-rich tasks.

### [268] [Unified Humanoid Fall-Safety Policy from a Few Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07407)
*Zhengjie Xu,Ye Li,Kwan-yee Lin,Stella X. Yu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a unified approach for humanoid fall management that integrates fall prevention, impact mitigation, and rapid recovery into a single policy using reinforcement learning and human demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanoid robots lack integrated strategies for handling falls when balance is lost, as existing approaches only address isolated aspects like fall avoidance, controlled descent, or standing up separately.

Method: The method fuses sparse human demonstrations with reinforcement learning and an adaptive diffusion-based memory of safe reactions to learn adaptive whole-body behaviors that unify all aspects of fall management.

Result: Experiments in simulation and on a Unitree G1 robot demonstrate robust sim-to-real transfer, lower impact forces, and consistently fast recovery across diverse disturbances.

Conclusion: The approach points towards safer, more resilient humanoids in real environments by making the entire fall-and-recovery process safe and autonomous.

Abstract: Falling is an inherent risk of humanoid mobility. Maintaining stability is thus a primary safety focus in robot control and learning, yet no existing approach fully averts loss of balance. When instability does occur, prior work addresses only isolated aspects of falling: avoiding falls, choreographing a controlled descent, or standing up afterward. Consequently, humanoid robots lack integrated strategies for impact mitigation and prompt recovery when real falls defy these scripts. We aim to go beyond keeping balance to make the entire fall-and-recovery process safe and autonomous: prevent falls when possible, reduce impact when unavoidable, and stand up when fallen. By fusing sparse human demonstrations with reinforcement learning and an adaptive diffusion-based memory of safe reactions, we learn adaptive whole-body behaviors that unify fall prevention, impact mitigation, and rapid recovery in one policy. Experiments in simulation and on a Unitree G1 demonstrate robust sim-to-real transfer, lower impact forces, and consistently fast recovery across diverse disturbances, pointing towards safer, more resilient humanoids in real environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs and VLMs are widely used for embodied symbolic planning, their use as closed-loop planners remains unexplored. Their black-box nature can produce unpredictable errors, making high-level robotic planning challenging.

Method: The study designs controlled experiments to examine how control horizon and warm-starting impact VLM symbolic planner performance from a control-theoretic perspective.

Conclusion: The work offers practical guidance on effectively utilizing VLMs for closed-loop symbolic planning in robotic applications through control-theoretic analysis.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used for embodied symbolic planning. Yet, how to effectively use these models for closed-loop symbolic planning remains largely unexplored. Because they operate as black boxes, LLMs and VLMs can produce unpredictable or costly errors, making their use in high-level robotic planning especially challenging. In this work, we investigate how to use VLMs as closed-loop symbolic planners for robotic applications from a control-theoretic perspective. Concretely, we study how the control horizon and warm-starting impact the performance of VLM symbolic planners. We design and conduct controlled experiments to gain insights that are broadly applicable to utilizing VLMs as closed-loop symbolic planners, and we discuss recommendations that can help improve the performance of VLM symbolic planners.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PhysWorld is a framework that enables robot learning from video generation by coupling video generation with physical world reconstruction, transforming visual guidance into physically accurate robotic actions without real robot data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video generation models can synthesize photorealistic demonstrations from language commands, but directly using pixel motions from generated videos neglects physics, resulting in inaccurate robotic manipulations.

Method: Given an image and task command, PhysWorld generates task-conditioned videos, reconstructs the underlying physical world from videos, and grounds generated motions into physically accurate actions through object-centric residual reinforcement learning with the physical world model.

Result: PhysWorld substantially improves manipulation accuracy compared to previous approaches on diverse real-world tasks, enabling zero-shot generalizable robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: The synergy between video generation and physical world modeling transforms implicit visual guidance into physically executable robotic trajectories, eliminating the need for real robot data collection.

Abstract: We introduce PhysWorld, a framework that enables robot learning from video generation through physical world modeling. Recent video generation models can synthesize photorealistic visual demonstrations from language commands and images, offering a powerful yet underexplored source of training signals for robotics. However, directly retargeting pixel motions from generated videos to robots neglects physics, often resulting in inaccurate manipulations. PhysWorld addresses this limitation by coupling video generation with physical world reconstruction. Given a single image and a task command, our method generates task-conditioned videos and reconstructs the underlying physical world from the videos, and the generated video motions are grounded into physically accurate actions through object-centric residual reinforcement learning with the physical world model. This synergy transforms implicit visual guidance into physically executable robotic trajectories, eliminating the need for real robot data collection and enabling zero-shot generalizable robotic manipulation. Experiments on diverse real-world tasks demonstrate that PhysWorld substantially improves manipulation accuracy compared to previous approaches.

### [272] [Evidence-Bound Autonomous Research (EviBound): A Governance Framework for Eliminating False Claims](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05524)
*Ruiying Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EviBound is an evidence-bound execution framework that eliminates false claims in LLM-based autonomous research through dual governance gates requiring machine-checkable evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based autonomous research agents often report false claims by marking tasks as 'complete' despite missing artifacts, contradictory metrics, or failed executions, compromising research integrity.

Method: Dual governance gates: pre-execution Approval Gate validates acceptance criteria schemas before code runs, and post-execution Verification Gate validates artifacts via MLflow API queries with recursive path checking and optional metric validation. Claims propagate only when backed by queryable run ID, required artifacts, and FINISHED status.

Result: Evaluation on 8 benchmark tasks: Baseline A (Prompt-Level Only) had 100% hallucination (8/8 claimed, 0/8 verified), Baseline B (Verification-Only) reduced hallucination to 25% (2/8 fail verification), EviBound achieved 0% hallucination with 7/8 tasks verified and 1 task correctly blocked at approval gate, with only ~8.3% execution overhead.

Conclusion: Research integrity is an architectural property achieved through governance gates rather than emergent from model scale. The framework provides execution trajectories, MLflow run IDs, and a 4-step verification protocol.

Abstract: LLM-based autonomous research agents report false claims: tasks marked "complete" despite missing artifacts, contradictory metrics, or failed executions. EviBound is an evidence-bound execution framework that eliminates false claims through dual governance gates requiring machine-checkable evidence.
  Two complementary gates enforce evidence requirements. The pre-execution Approval Gate validates acceptance criteria schemas before code runs, catching structural violations proactively. The post-execution Verification Gate validates artifacts via MLflow API queries (with recursive path checking) and optionally validates metrics when specified by acceptance criteria. Claims propagate only when backed by a queryable run ID, required artifacts, and FINISHED status. Bounded, confidence-gated retries (typically 1-2 attempts) recover from transient failures without unbounded loops.
  The framework was evaluated on 8 benchmark tasks spanning infrastructure validation, ML capabilities, and governance stress tests. Baseline A (Prompt-Level Only) yields 100% hallucination (8/8 claimed, 0/8 verified). Baseline B (Verification-Only) reduces hallucination to 25% (2/8 fail verification). EviBound (Dual Gates) achieves 0% hallucination: 7/8 tasks verified and 1 task correctly blocked at the approval gate, all with only approximately 8.3% execution overhead.
  This package includes execution trajectories, MLflow run IDs for all verified tasks, and a 4-step verification protocol. Research integrity is an architectural property, achieved through governance gates rather than emergent from model scale.

*Francisco Caravaca,Ángel Cuevas,Rubén Cuevas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Large-scale measurement study of LLM inference energy consumption across 32,500+ measurements, 21 GPU configurations, and 155 model architectures, leading to a predictive model for energy estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid expansion of LLMs has created unprecedented energy demands, particularly for inference workloads that dominate total lifecycle consumption, yet systematic analyses of inference energy consumption remain limited.

Method: Conducted large-scale measurement-based study using vLLM inference engine, quantifying energy usage at prompt level across diverse hardware and model configurations, then developed predictive model for energy estimation.

Result: Identified how architectural and operational factors shape energy demand, created accurate predictive model for inference energy consumption across unseen architectures and hardware, implemented as browser extension.

Conclusion: Provides systematic analysis of LLM inference energy consumption and tools to raise awareness of environmental impact, enabling better energy management in generative AI deployments.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced unprecedented energy demands, extending beyond training to large-scale inference workloads that often dominate total lifecycle consumption. Deploying these models requires energy-intensive GPU infrastructure, and in some cases has even prompted plans to power data centers with nuclear energy. Despite this growing relevance, systematic analyses of inference energy consumption remain limited. In this work, we present a large-scale measurement-based study comprising over 32,500 measurements across 21 GPU configurations and 155 model architectures, from small open-source models to frontier systems. Using the vLLM inference engine, we quantify energy usage at the prompt level and identify how architectural and operational factors shape energy demand. Building on these insights, we develop a predictive model that accurately estimates inference energy consumption across unseen architectures and hardware, and implement it as a browser extension to raise awareness of the environmental impact of generative AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought reasoning enhances LLM problem-solving but creates substantial inference overhead, limiting deployment in resource-constrained settings. Need efficient CoT transfer across different model scales and architectures.

Method: Adaptive reasoning summarization framework with semantic segmentation and importance scoring, budget-aware dynamic compression, and coherence reconstruction to compress reasoning traces while preserving critical steps.

Conclusion: Reasoning summarization provides a practical path toward efficient CoT transfer, enabling advanced reasoning under tight computational constraints.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhances the problem-solving ability of large language models (LLMs) but leads to substantial inference overhead, limiting deployment in resource-constrained settings. This paper investigates efficient CoT transfer across models of different scales and architectures through an adaptive reasoning summarization framework. The proposed method compresses reasoning traces via semantic segmentation with importance scoring, budget-aware dynamic compression, and coherence reconstruction, preserving critical reasoning steps while significantly reducing token usage. Experiments on 7{,}501 medical examination questions across 10 specialties show up to 40% higher accuracy than truncation under the same token budgets. Evaluations on 64 model pairs from eight LLMs (1.5B-32B parameters, including DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3) confirm strong cross-model transferability. Furthermore, a Gaussian Process-based Bayesian optimization module reduces evaluation cost by 84% and reveals a power-law relationship between model size and cross-domain robustness. These results demonstrate that reasoning summarization provides a practical path toward efficient CoT transfer, enabling advanced reasoning under tight computational constraints. Code will be released upon publication.

### [275] [Anchors in the Machine: Behavioral and Attributional Evidence of Anchoring Bias in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05766)
*Felipe Valencia-Clavijo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that LLMs exhibit robust anchoring bias through behavioral analysis and attribution methods, showing anchor-induced probability shifts in output distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether cognitive biases like anchoring in LLMs reflect surface imitation or deeper probability shifts, and to develop methods for quantifying and interpreting these biases.

Method: Used log-probability behavioral analysis with contamination controls, Shapley-value attribution over prompt fields, and developed an Anchoring Bias Sensitivity Score integrating behavioral and attribution evidence across six open-source models.

Result: Found robust anchoring effects in Gemma-2B, Phi-2, and Llama-2-7B, with attribution showing anchor influence on probability reweighting. Smaller models showed variability, suggesting scale modulates sensitivity.

Conclusion: Anchoring bias in LLMs is robust, measurable, and interpretable, but attribution effects vary across prompts, highlighting risks in treating LLMs as human substitutes. The framework bridges behavioral science, LLM safety, and interpretability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly examined as both behavioral subjects and decision systems, yet it remains unclear whether observed cognitive biases reflect surface imitation or deeper probability shifts. Anchoring bias, a classic human judgment bias, offers a critical test case. While prior work shows LLMs exhibit anchoring, most evidence relies on surface-level outputs, leaving internal mechanisms and attributional contributions unexplored. This paper advances the study of anchoring in LLMs through three contributions: (1) a log-probability-based behavioral analysis showing that anchors shift entire output distributions, with controls for training-data contamination; (2) exact Shapley-value attribution over structured prompt fields to quantify anchor influence on model log-probabilities; and (3) a unified Anchoring Bias Sensitivity Score integrating behavioral and attributional evidence across six open-source models. Results reveal robust anchoring effects in Gemma-2B, Phi-2, and Llama-2-7B, with attribution signaling that the anchors influence reweighting. Smaller models such as GPT-2, Falcon-RW-1B, and GPT-Neo-125M show variability, suggesting scale may modulate sensitivity. Attributional effects, however, vary across prompt designs, underscoring fragility in treating LLMs as human substitutes. The findings demonstrate that anchoring bias in LLMs is robust, measurable, and interpretable, while highlighting risks in applied domains. More broadly, the framework bridges behavioral science, LLM safety, and interpretability, offering a reproducible path for evaluating other cognitive biases in LLMs.

### [276] [Unveiling Modality Bias: Automated Sample-Specific Analysis for Multimodal Misinformation Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05883)
*Hehai Lin,Hui Liu,Shilei Cao,Jing Li,Haoliang Li,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes three automated methods for detecting modality bias at the sample level in multimodal misinformation benchmarks, addressing limitations of previous dataset-level approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal misinformation benchmarks have modality bias where detectors can predict using only one modality, and previous approaches lack sample-level insights and scalability for online information.

Method: Three bias quantification methods: 1) coarse-grained modality benefit evaluation, 2) medium-grained information flow quantification, and 3) fine-grained causality analysis, validated through human evaluation on two benchmarks.

Result: Three key findings: 1) Ensembling multiple views is crucial for reliable automated analysis, 2) Automated analysis is prone to detector-induced fluctuations, and 3) Different views agree more on modality-balanced samples but diverge on biased ones.

Conclusion: The proposed automated methods effectively identify modality bias at sample level, revealing important insights about view ensembling, detector sensitivity, and bias detection patterns that guide future research directions.

Abstract: Numerous multimodal misinformation benchmarks exhibit bias toward specific modalities, allowing detectors to make predictions based solely on one modality. While previous research has quantified bias at the dataset level or manually identified spurious correlations between modalities and labels, these approaches lack meaningful insights at the sample level and struggle to scale to the vast amount of online information. In this paper, we investigate the design for automated recognition of modality bias at the sample level. Specifically, we propose three bias quantification methods based on theories/views of different levels of granularity: 1) a coarse-grained evaluation of modality benefit; 2) a medium-grained quantification of information flow; and 3) a fine-grained causality analysis. To verify the effectiveness, we conduct a human evaluation on two popular benchmarks. Experimental results reveal three interesting findings that provide potential direction toward future research: 1)~Ensembling multiple views is crucial for reliable automated analysis; 2)~Automated analysis is prone to detector-induced fluctuations; and 3)~Different views produce a higher agreement on modality-balanced samples but diverge on biased ones.

*Hiroaki Hayashi,Bo Pang,Wenting Zhao,Ye Liu,Akash Gokul,Srijan Bansal,Caiming Xiong,Semih Yavuz,Yingbo Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAGE enables LLM agents to learn from their own task executions through self-abstraction, creating concise plan abstractions that refine subsequent behavior and improve performance on software engineering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agents operate in static frameworks without mechanisms to learn from experience, limiting their performance to initial design and LLM capabilities.

Method: After initial rollout, agents induce concise plan abstractions from grounded experience (key steps, dependencies, constraints), which are then used as contextual guidance to refine policy and support more structured subsequent executions.

Result: SAGE achieves 7.2% relative improvement over Mini-SWE-Agent baseline with GPT-5, and reaches 73.2% and 74% Pass@1 resolve rates on SWE-Bench Verified with Mini-SWE-Agent and OpenHands CodeAct respectively.

Conclusion: The SAGE framework enables consistent performance gains across diverse LLM backbones and agent architectures by allowing agents to learn and self-improve through experience-based abstraction.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based agents are increasingly used to tackle software engineering tasks that require multi-step reasoning and code modification, demonstrating promising yet limited performance. However, most existing LLM agents typically operate within static execution frameworks, lacking a principled mechanism to learn and self-improve from their own experience and past rollouts. As a result, their performance remains bounded by the initial framework design and the underlying LLM's capabilities. We propose Self-Abstraction from Grounded Experience (SAGE), a framework that enables agents to learn from their own task executions and refine their behavior through self-abstraction. After an initial rollout, the agent induces a concise plan abstraction from its grounded experience, distilling key steps, dependencies, and constraints. This learned abstraction is then fed back as contextual guidance, refining the agent's policy and supporting more structured, informed subsequent executions. Empirically, SAGE delivers consistent performance gains across diverse LLM backbones and agent architectures. Notably, it yields a 7.2% relative performance improvement over the strong Mini-SWE-Agent baseline when paired with the GPT-5 (high) backbone. SAGE further achieves strong overall performance on SWE-Bench Verified benchmark, reaching 73.2% and 74% Pass@1 resolve rates with the Mini-SWE-Agent and OpenHands CodeAct agent framework, respectively.

Abstract: Despite the proliferation of powerful agentic models, the lack of critical post-training details hinders the development of strong counterparts in the open-source community. In this study, we present a comprehensive and fully open-source pipeline for training a high-performance agentic model for interacting with external tools and environments, named Klear-Qwen3-AgentForge, starting from the Qwen3-8B base model. We design effective supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with synthetic data followed by multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) to unlock the potential for multiple diverse agentic tasks. We perform exclusive experiments on various agentic benchmarks in both tool use and coding domains. Klear-Qwen3-AgentForge-8B achieves state-of-the-art performance among LLMs of similar size and remains competitive with significantly larger models.

TL;DR: The paper treats agent awareness as knowledge, distinguishing de re and de dicto forms, and provides a sound and complete logical system for their interplay with standard knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To break from traditional approaches to agent awareness in literature by conceptualizing it as a form of knowledge rather than a separate cognitive state.

Method: Introduces two modalities for de re and de dicto awareness, formally specifies their meaning using 2D-semantics, and develops a logical system.

Result: Achieved a sound and complete logical system that describes the relationships between the two new awareness modalities and the standard knowledge modality.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully formalizes agent awareness as knowledge, providing a rigorous logical foundation for understanding different forms of awareness and their interaction with factual knowledge.

Abstract: The paper proposes to treat agent awareness as a form of knowledge, breaking the tradition in the existing literature on awareness. It distinguishes the de re and de dicto forms of such knowledge. The work introduces two modalities capturing these forms and formally specifies their meaning using a version of 2D-semantics. The main technical result is a sound and complete logical system describing the interplay between the two proposed modalities and the standard "knowledge of the fact" modality.

TL;DR: ScRPO is a two-stage RL framework that enhances LLMs on math problems through trial-and-error learning and self-correction, outperforming other methods on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve large language models' performance on challenging mathematical problems by enabling self-reflection and error correction with limited external feedback.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) Trial-and-error learning with GRPO to collect incorrect answers in an error pool, (2) Self-correction learning where the model reflects on why previous answers were wrong.

Result: Consistently outperforms several post-training methods across multiple math reasoning benchmarks including AIME, AMC, Olympiad, MATH-500, and GSM8k using Deepseek-Distill-Qwen models.

Conclusion: ScRPO is a promising paradigm for enabling language models to self-improve on difficult tasks with limited external feedback, paving the way toward more reliable and capable AI systems.

Abstract: We propose Self-correction Relative Policy Optimization (ScRPO), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance large language models on challenging mathematical problems by leveraging self-reflection and error correction. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) Trial-and-error learning stage: training the model with GRPO and collecting incorrect answers along with their corresponding questions in an error pool; (2) Self-correction learning stage: guiding the model to reflect on why its previous answers were wrong. Extensive experiments across multiple math reasoning benchmarks, including AIME, AMC, Olympiad, MATH-500, GSM8k, using Deepseek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and Deepseek-Distill-Qwen-7B. The experimental results demonstrate that ScRPO consistently outperforms several post-training methods. These findings highlight ScRPO as a promising paradigm for enabling language models to self-improve on difficult tasks with limited external feedback, paving the way toward more reliable and capable AI systems.

*Wei Yang,Jiacheng Pang,Shixuan Li,Paul Bogdan,Stephen Tu,Jesse Thomason*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Maestro is a multi-agent framework that separates exploration and synthesis roles using Execution Agents for diverse exploration and a Central Agent for convergent synthesis, enhanced by CLPO reinforcement learning for better credit assignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent LLM systems struggle with balancing exploration and synthesis, leading to premature consensus, error propagation, and poor credit assignment between genuine reasoning and plausible arguments.

Method: Maestro framework with parallel Execution Agents for exploration and a Central Agent for synthesis, plus Conditional Listwise Policy Optimization (CLPO) that combines decision-focused policy gradients with list-wise ranking loss over justifications.

Result: Achieves absolute accuracy gains of 6% on average and up to 10% at best on mathematical reasoning and general problem-solving benchmarks, outperforming state-of-the-art multi-agent approaches.

Conclusion: Structural decoupling of exploration and synthesis roles with CLPO enables effective management of cognitive tension in multi-agent systems, leading to superior performance through clean credit assignment and stronger comparative supervision.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) built on Large Language Models (LLMs) are being used to approach complex problems and can surpass single model inference. However, their success hinges on navigating a fundamental cognitive tension: the need to balance broad, divergent exploration of the solution space with a principled, convergent synthesis to the optimal solution. Existing paradigms often struggle to manage this duality, leading to premature consensus, error propagation, and a critical credit assignment problem that fails to distinguish between genuine reasoning and superficially plausible arguments. To resolve this core challenge, we propose the Multi-Agent Exploration-Synthesis framework Through Role Orchestration (Maestro), a principled paradigm for collaboration that structurally decouples these cognitive modes. Maestro uses a collective of parallel Execution Agents for diverse exploration and a specialized Central Agent for convergent, evaluative synthesis. To operationalize this critical synthesis phase, we introduce Conditional Listwise Policy Optimization (CLPO), a reinforcement learning objective that disentangles signals for strategic decisions and tactical rationales. By combining decision-focused policy gradients with a list-wise ranking loss over justifications, CLPO achieves clean credit assignment and stronger comparative supervision. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and general problem-solving benchmarks demonstrate that Maestro, coupled with CLPO, consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art multi-agent approaches, delivering absolute accuracy gains of 6% on average and up to 10% at best.

*Stefano Ferraro,Akihiro Nakano,Masahiro Suzuki,Yutaka Matsuo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Object-centric world models (OCWM) aim to decompose scenes into object representations for better generalization. DLPWM, an unsupervised disentangled OCWM, shows strong visual reconstruction but underperforms in control tasks due to representation shift during object interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test if disentangled object-level representations can improve policy performance and compositional generalization in reinforcement learning by localizing task-relevant information.

Method: Introduces DLPWM, a fully unsupervised disentangled object-centric world model that learns object-level latents directly from pixels, achieving strong reconstruction and prediction with OOD robustness.

Result: DLPWM achieves strong reconstruction and prediction performance with OOD robustness, but policies trained on its latents underperform DreamerV3 in downstream control tasks due to representation shift during multi-object interactions.

Conclusion: Object-centric perception supports robust visual modeling but achieving stable control requires mitigating latent drift caused by representation shift during object interactions.

Abstract: Object-centric world models (OCWM) aim to decompose visual scenes into object-level representations, providing structured abstractions that could improve compositional generalization and data efficiency in reinforcement learning. We hypothesize that explicitly disentangled object-level representations, by localizing task-relevant information, can enhance policy performance across novel feature combinations. To test this hypothesis, we introduce DLPWM, a fully unsupervised, disentangled object-centric world model that learns object-level latents directly from pixels. DLPWM achieves strong reconstruction and prediction performance, including robustness to several out-of-distribution (OOD) visual variations. However, when used for downstream model-based control, policies trained on DLPWM latents underperform compared to DreamerV3. Through latent-trajectory analyses, we identify representation shift during multi-object interactions as a key driver of unstable policy learning. Our results suggest that, although object-centric perception supports robust visual modeling, achieving stable control requires mitigating latent drift.

*Sizhe Tang,Jiayu Chen,Tian Lan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MALinZero addresses the exponential growth of action space in multi-agent MCTS by projecting joint-action returns into low-dimensional space using contextual linear bandits, enabling efficient exploration with LinUCT and achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCTS faces exponential growth in combinatorial action space for multi-agent planning, making tree expansion and exploration-exploitation balance very difficult due to large branching factors.

Method: Projects joint-action returns into low-dimensional space using contextual linear bandit formulation, solves with convex and smooth loss functions to prioritize better actions, and derives LinUCT for multi-agent exploration in reduced space.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multi-agent benchmarks (matrix games, SMAC, SMACv2), outperforming both model-based and model-free MARL baselines with faster learning speed and better performance.

Conclusion: MALinZero successfully enables efficient MCTS in complex multi-agent planning through low-dimensional representation and linear bandit formulation, with theoretical guarantees and practical performance improvements.

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which leverages Upper Confidence Bound for Trees (UCTs) to balance exploration and exploitation through randomized sampling, is instrumental to solving complex planning problems. However, for multi-agent planning, MCTS is confronted with a large combinatorial action space that often grows exponentially with the number of agents. As a result, the branching factor of MCTS during tree expansion also increases exponentially, making it very difficult to efficiently explore and exploit during tree search. To this end, we propose MALinZero, a new approach to leverage low-dimensional representational structures on joint-action returns and enable efficient MCTS in complex multi-agent planning. Our solution can be viewed as projecting the joint-action returns into the low-dimensional space representable using a contextual linear bandit problem formulation. We solve the contextual linear bandit problem with convex and $μ$-smooth loss functions -- in order to place more importance on better joint actions and mitigate potential representational limitations -- and derive a linear Upper Confidence Bound applied to trees (LinUCT) to enable novel multi-agent exploration and exploitation in the low-dimensional space. We analyze the regret of MALinZero for low-dimensional reward functions and propose an $(1-\tfrac1e)$-approximation algorithm for the joint action selection by maximizing a sub-modular objective.

*Fatima Jahara,Mark Dredze,Sharon Levy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PRIME is a new evaluation framework that uses logic grid puzzles to systematically probe subtle social biases in LLMs' logical reasoning, particularly focusing on gender stereotypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety guardrails suppress overt biases but miss subtler forms that emerge during complex logical reasoning tasks, which evade existing evaluation benchmarks.

Method: Uses logic grid puzzles with stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, and neutral variants generated from shared puzzle structures, enabling automatic generation/verification and controlled comparisons across puzzle sizes and complexity.

Result: Models consistently reason more accurately when solutions align with stereotypical associations, demonstrating systematic bias in deductive reasoning.

Conclusion: PRIME effectively diagnoses and quantifies social biases in LLMs' logical reasoning, highlighting the need for better evaluation frameworks where fairness is critical.

Abstract: While recent safety guardrails effectively suppress overtly biased outputs, subtler forms of social bias emerge during complex logical reasoning tasks that evade current evaluation benchmarks. To fill this gap, we introduce a new evaluation framework, PRIME (Puzzle Reasoning for Implicit Biases in Model Evaluation), that uses logic grid puzzles to systematically probe the influence of social stereotypes on logical reasoning and decision making in LLMs. Our use of logic puzzles enables automatic generation and verification, as well as variability in complexity and biased settings. PRIME includes stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, and neutral puzzle variants generated from a shared puzzle structure, allowing for controlled and fine-grained comparisons. We evaluate multiple model families across puzzle sizes and test the effectiveness of prompt-based mitigation strategies. Focusing our experiments on gender stereotypes, our findings highlight that models consistently reason more accurately when solutions align with stereotypical associations. This demonstrates the significance of PRIME for diagnosing and quantifying social biases perpetuated in the deductive reasoning of LLMs, where fairness is critical.

*Boxuan Wang,Zhuoyun Li,Xinmiao Huang,Xiaowei Huang,Yi Dong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Alignment Score metric to evaluate reasoning consistency in LLMs and proposes SCOS method to optimize it, showing 29.84% improvement in alignment scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of reasoning inconsistency in LLMs' Chain-of-Thought reasoning by developing a systematic framework for evaluation and optimization.

Method: Proposed Alignment Score metric to quantify semantic alignment between model-generated and human reference reasoning chains, identified four error types, and developed Semantic Consistency Optimization Sampling (SCOS) method to favor chains with minimal alignment errors.

Result: Empirical findings show 2-hop reasoning chains achieve highest Alignment Score, and SCOS method improves Alignment Scores by average 29.84% with longer reasoning chains like 3-hop tasks.

Conclusion: The framework successfully evaluates and optimizes reasoning consistency in LLMs, with SCOS method effectively improving alignment between model-generated and human reasoning chains, particularly for longer reasoning tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for evaluating and optimizing reasoning consistency in Large Language Models (LLMs) via a new metric, the Alignment Score, which quantifies the semantic alignment between model-generated reasoning chains and human-written reference chains in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Empirically, we find that 2-hop reasoning chains achieve the highest Alignment Score. To explain this phenomenon, we define four key error types: logical disconnection, thematic shift, redundant reasoning, and causal reversal, and show how each contributes to the degradation of the Alignment Score. Building on this analysis, we further propose Semantic Consistency Optimization Sampling (SCOS), a method that samples and favors chains with minimal alignment errors, significantly improving Alignment Scores by an average of 29.84% with longer reasoning chains, such as in 3-hop tasks.

### [286] [CSP4SDG: Constraint and Information-Theory Based Role Identification in Social Deduction Games with LLM-Enhanced Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06175)
*Kaijie Xu,Fandi Meng,Clark Verbrugge,Simon Lucas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CSP4SDG is a probabilistic constraint-satisfaction framework for hidden-role inference in Social Deduction Games that outperforms LLM-based methods and can enhance LLM performance when used as a reasoning tool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social Deduction Games require accurate hidden-role identification, which is challenging due to players concealing identities and deliberately misleading others. Current approaches need more objective and interpretable methods for role inference.

Method: Game events and dialogue are mapped to four constraint classes: evidence, phenomena, assertions, and hypotheses. Hard constraints prune impossible role assignments, while weighted soft constraints score remaining possibilities using information-gain weighting and a closed-form scoring rule.

Result: CSP4SDG outperforms LLM-based baselines in all inference scenarios on three public datasets and boosts LLM performance when used as an auxiliary reasoning tool. The framework provides fully interpretable posterior role distributions that update in real time.

Conclusion: Principled probabilistic reasoning with information theory offers a scalable alternative or complement to heavy-weight neural models for Social Deduction Games, providing objective, interpretable role inference.

Abstract: In Social Deduction Games (SDGs) such as Avalon, Mafia, and Werewolf, players conceal their identities and deliberately mislead others, making hidden-role inference a central and demanding task. Accurate role identification, which forms the basis of an agent's belief state, is therefore the keystone for both human and AI performance. We introduce CSP4SDG, a probabilistic, constraint-satisfaction framework that analyses gameplay objectively. Game events and dialogue are mapped to four linguistically-agnostic constraint classes-evidence, phenomena, assertions, and hypotheses. Hard constraints prune impossible role assignments, while weighted soft constraints score the remainder; information-gain weighting links each hypothesis to its expected value under entropy reduction, and a simple closed-form scoring rule guarantees that truthful assertions converge to classical hard logic with minimum error. The resulting posterior over roles is fully interpretable and updates in real time. Experiments on three public datasets show that CSP4SDG (i) outperforms LLM-based baselines in every inference scenario, and (ii) boosts LLMs when supplied as an auxiliary "reasoning tool." Our study validates that principled probabilistic reasoning with information theory is a scalable alternative-or complement-to heavy-weight neural models for SDGs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing demand for AI applications in materials discovery, molecular modeling, and climate science requires extensive data preparation, which is labor-intensive and expertise-dependent.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes lightweight uncertainty quantification heads (UHeads) that use LLM internal states to verify reasoning steps, matching performance of much larger models while being fully automatic and parameter-efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reasoning verification methods are computationally expensive, domain-limited, or require large-scale annotations, creating a need for more scalable and generalizable approaches.

Method: Train transformer-based UHeads on frozen LLM internal states to estimate reasoning step uncertainty, using automatic labels from larger LLMs or self-supervised generation from the original model.

Result: UHeads (under 10M parameters) match or surpass Process Reward Models up to 810x larger across mathematics, planning, and QA domains, showing LLM internal states encode reliable uncertainty signals.

Conclusion: LLM internal states can effectively encode uncertainty for reasoning verification, offering a scalable path toward introspective LLMs without expensive annotations or large model overhead.

Abstract: Solving complex tasks usually requires LLMs to generate long multi-step reasoning chains. Previous work has shown that verifying the correctness of individual reasoning steps can further improve the performance and efficiency of LLMs on such tasks and enhance solution interpretability. However, existing verification approaches, such as Process Reward Models (PRMs), are either computationally expensive, limited to specific domains, or require large-scale human or model-generated annotations. Thus, we propose a lightweight alternative for step-level reasoning verification based on data-driven uncertainty scores. We train transformer-based uncertainty quantification heads (UHeads) that use the internal states of a frozen LLM to estimate the uncertainty of its reasoning steps during generation. The approach is fully automatic: target labels are generated either by another larger LLM (e.g., DeepSeek R1) or in a self-supervised manner by the original model itself. UHeads are both effective and lightweight, containing less than 10M parameters. Across multiple domains, including mathematics, planning, and general knowledge question answering, they match or even surpass the performance of PRMs that are up to 810x larger. Our findings suggest that the internal states of LLMs encode their uncertainty and can serve as reliable signals for reasoning verification, offering a promising direction toward scalable and generalizable introspective LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VibeThinker-1.5B is a 1.5B-parameter model that challenges the scaling paradigm by achieving reasoning capabilities comparable to much larger models through the Spectrum-to-Signal Principle, with only $7,800 training cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the consensus that small models inherently lack robust reasoning capabilities and demonstrate that parameter scaling is not the only path to enhanced AI reasoning.

Method: Uses Spectrum-to-Signal Principle (SSP) with Two-Stage Diversity-Exploring Distillation (SFT) to generate broad solution spectrum, followed by MaxEnt-Guided Policy Optimization (RL) to amplify correct signals.

Result: Outperforms 400x larger DeepSeek R1 on math benchmarks (AIME24: 80.3 vs 79.8, AIME25: 74.4 vs 70.0, HMMT25: 50.4 vs 41.7) and scores 51.1 on LiveCodeBench V6, beating Magistral Medium's 50.3.

Conclusion: Small models can achieve reasoning capabilities comparable to large models, drastically reducing training and inference costs and democratizing advanced AI research.

Abstract: Challenging the prevailing consensus that small models inherently lack robust reasoning, this report introduces VibeThinker-1.5B, a 1.5B-parameter dense model developed via our Spectrum-to-Signal Principle (SSP). This challenges the prevailing approach of scaling model parameters to enhance capabilities, as seen in models like DeepSeek R1 (671B) and Kimi k2 (>1T). The SSP framework first employs a Two-Stage Diversity-Exploring Distillation (SFT) to generate a broad spectrum of solutions, followed by MaxEnt-Guided Policy Optimization (RL) to amplify the correct signal. With a total training cost of only $7,800, VibeThinker-1.5B demonstrates superior reasoning capabilities compared to closed-source models like Magistral Medium and Claude Opus 4, and performs on par with open-source models like GPT OSS-20B Medium. Remarkably, it surpasses the 400x larger DeepSeek R1 on three math benchmarks: AIME24 (80.3 vs. 79.8), AIME25 (74.4 vs. 70.0), and HMMT25 (50.4 vs. 41.7). This is a substantial improvement over its base model (6.7, 4.3, and 0.6, respectively). On LiveCodeBench V6, it scores 51.1, outperforming Magistral Medium's 50.3 and its base model's 0.0. These findings demonstrate that small models can achieve reasoning capabilities comparable to large models, drastically reducing training and inference costs and thereby democratizing advanced AI research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ROAR introduces a robust accident anticipation system combining DWT, object-aware modules, and dynamic focal loss to handle real-world challenges like sensor failures, environmental noise, and data imbalance across different vehicle types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing accident anticipation methods assume ideal conditions and overlook practical challenges like sensor failures, environmental disturbances, data imperfections, and variability in driver behavior across vehicle types, which degrade prediction accuracy.

Method: ROAR combines Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for feature extraction from noisy data, a self-adaptive object-aware module to focus on high-risk vehicles and model spatiotemporal relationships, and dynamic focal loss to address class imbalance.

Result: Evaluated on DAD, CCD, and A3D datasets, ROAR consistently outperforms existing baselines in Average Precision (AP) and mean Time to Accident (mTTA), demonstrating robustness against sensor degradation, environmental noise, and imbalanced data.

Conclusion: ROAR provides a reliable solution for accurate accident anticipation in complex traffic environments by effectively handling real-world challenges that previous methods overlooked.

Abstract: Accurate accident anticipation is essential for enhancing the safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, existing methods often assume ideal conditions, overlooking challenges such as sensor failures, environmental disturbances, and data imperfections, which can significantly degrade prediction accuracy. Additionally, previous models have not adequately addressed the considerable variability in driver behavior and accident rates across different vehicle types. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces ROAR, a novel approach for accident detection and prediction. ROAR combines Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), a self adaptive object aware module, and dynamic focal loss to tackle these challenges. The DWT effectively extracts features from noisy and incomplete data, while the object aware module improves accident prediction by focusing on high-risk vehicles and modeling the spatial temporal relationships among traffic agents. Moreover, dynamic focal loss mitigates the impact of class imbalance between positive and negative samples. Evaluated on three widely used datasets, Dashcam Accident Dataset (DAD), Car Crash Dataset (CCD), and AnAn Accident Detection (A3D), our model consistently outperforms existing baselines in key metrics such as Average Precision (AP) and mean Time to Accident (mTTA). These results demonstrate the model's robustness in real-world conditions, particularly in handling sensor degradation, environmental noise, and imbalanced data distributions. This work offers a promising solution for reliable and accurate accident anticipation in complex traffic environments.

*Siming Zhao,Qi Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GAIA is a governance-first framework for LLM-human collaboration in B2B negotiation and screening that addresses safety concerns through three key mechanisms: information-gated progression, dual feedback integration, and authorization boundaries with escalation paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI negotiation systems lack practical governance features needed for high-stakes B2B settings, including staged information gathering, explicit authorization boundaries, and systematic feedback integration, which limits their safe deployment.

Method: GAIA defines three roles (Principal, Delegate, Counterparty) with optional Critic, and implements three coordinated mechanisms: information-gated progression separating screening from negotiation, dual feedback combining AI critique with human corrections, and authorization boundaries with escalation paths.

Result: The framework establishes four safety invariants for delegation with bounded authorization, implements task-completeness tracking for state transitions, and provides a hybrid validation blueprint combining automated metrics with human judgment.

Conclusion: GAIA bridges theory and practice to offer a reproducible specification for safe, efficient, and accountable AI delegation applicable across procurement, real estate, and staffing workflows.

Abstract: Organizations are increasingly exploring delegation of screening and negotiation tasks to AI systems, yet deployment in high-stakes B2B settings is constrained by governance: preventing unauthorized commitments, ensuring sufficient information before bargaining, and maintaining effective human oversight and auditability. Prior work on large language model negotiation largely emphasizes autonomous bargaining between agents and omits practical needs such as staged information gathering, explicit authorization boundaries, and systematic feedback integration. We propose GAIA, a governance-first framework for LLM-human agency in B2B negotiation and screening. GAIA defines three essential roles - Principal (human), Delegate (LLM agent), and Counterparty - with an optional Critic to enhance performance, and organizes interactions through three mechanisms: information-gated progression that separates screening from negotiation; dual feedback integration that combines AI critique with lightweight human corrections; and authorization boundaries with explicit escalation paths. Our contributions are fourfold: (1) a formal governance framework with three coordinated mechanisms and four safety invariants for delegation with bounded authorization; (2) information-gated progression via task-completeness tracking (TCI) and explicit state transitions that separate screening from commitment; (3) dual feedback integration that blends Critic suggestions with human oversight through parallel learning channels; and (4) a hybrid validation blueprint that combines automated protocol metrics with human judgment of outcomes and safety. By bridging theory and practice, GAIA offers a reproducible specification for safe, efficient, and accountable AI delegation that can be instantiated across procurement, real estate, and staffing workflows.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A self-improving prompt framework for financial document analysis that uses synthetic data generation and optimization to automatically refine prompts without manual labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for financial document analysis rely on fixed datasets or costly manual curation, limiting adaptability to new question types and document structures.

Method: Closed-loop framework with synthetic data generator, verifiers, and prompt optimizer that iteratively exposes prompt weaknesses and refines prompts through feedback cycles.

Result: Achieves higher performance in accuracy and robustness on DocMath-Eval benchmark compared to standard prompt methods.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generation integrated into prompt learning provides significant value for financial reasoning tasks by enabling continuous improvement without external labels.

Abstract: Financial documents like earning reports or balance sheets often involve long tables and multi-page reports. Large language models have become a new tool to help numerical reasoning and understanding these documents. However, prompt quality can have a major effect on how well LLMs perform these financial reasoning tasks. Most current methods tune prompts on fixed datasets of financial text or tabular data, which limits their ability to adapt to new question types or document structures, or they involve costly and manually labeled/curated dataset to help build the prompts. We introduce a self-improving prompt framework driven by data-augmented optimization. In this closed-loop process, we generate synthetic financial tables and document excerpts, verify their correctness and robustness, and then update the prompt based on the results. Specifically, our framework combines a synthetic data generator with verifiers and a prompt optimizer, where the generator produces new examples that exposes weaknesses in the current prompt, the verifiers check the validity and robustness of the produced examples, and the optimizer incrementally refines the prompt in response. By iterating these steps in a feedback cycle, our method steadily improves prompt accuracy on financial reasoning tasks without needing external labels. Evaluation on DocMath-Eval benchmark demonstrates that our system achieves higher performance in both accuracy and robustness than standard prompt methods, underscoring the value of incorporating synthetic data generation into prompt learning for financial applications.

Motivation: There is a lack of publicly available tabular datasets for evaluating semantic table interpretation systems, particularly in domain-specific contexts like the security domain, which hinders progress in this research area.

Method: Created the Secu-Table dataset using security data from CVE and CWE sources, annotated with Wikidata and SEPSES CSKG knowledge graphs. The dataset includes 1500+ tables with 15k+ entities and is released with all code publicly available.

Result: The dataset was developed and made available to the research community through the SemTab challenge. Preliminary baseline evaluation was conducted using Falcon3-7b-instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct (open source LLMs) and GPT-4o mini (closed source LLM).

Conclusion: The Secu-Table dataset fills an important gap in security domain tabular data availability and enables evaluation of semantic table interpretation systems, particularly those based on LLMs, through the SemTab challenge framework.

Abstract: Evaluating semantic tables interpretation (STI) systems, (particularly, those based on Large Language Models- LLMs) especially in domain-specific contexts such as the security domain, depends heavily on the dataset. However, in the security domain, tabular datasets for state-of-the-art are not publicly available. In this paper, we introduce Secu-Table dataset, composed of more than 1500 tables with more than 15k entities constructed using security data extracted from Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) and Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) data sources and annotated using Wikidata and the SEmantic Processing of Security Event Streams CyberSecurity Knowledge Graph (SEPSES CSKG). Along with the dataset, all the code is publicly released. This dataset is made available to the research community in the context of the SemTab challenge on Tabular to Knowledge Graph Matching. This challenge aims to evaluate the performance of several STI based on open source LLMs. Preliminary evaluation, serving as baseline, was conducted using Falcon3-7b-instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct, two open source LLMs and GPT-4o mini one closed source LLM.

Conclusion: STATION represents a paradigm shift towards autonomous scientific discovery driven by emergent behavior in open-world environments, demonstrating the potential for AI agents to organically develop novel methods and advance scientific knowledge beyond traditional optimization approaches.

Abstract: We introduce the STATION, an open-world multi-agent environment that models a miniature scientific ecosystem. Leveraging their extended context windows, agents in the Station can engage in long scientific journeys that include reading papers from peers, formulating hypotheses, submitting code, performing analyses, and publishing results. Importantly, there is no centralized system coordinating their activities - agents are free to choose their own actions and develop their own narratives within the Station. Experiments demonstrate that AI agents in the Station achieve new state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of benchmarks, spanning from mathematics to computational biology to machine learning, notably surpassing AlphaEvolve in circle packing. A rich tapestry of narratives emerges as agents pursue independent research, interact with peers, and build upon a cumulative history. From these emergent narratives, novel methods arise organically, such as a new density-adaptive algorithm for scRNA-seq batch integration. The Station marks a first step towards autonomous scientific discovery driven by emergent behavior in an open-world environment, representing a new paradigm that moves beyond rigid optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low- and middle-income countries lack reliable road accident location data, and existing text-based geocoding tools fail with multilingual, unstructured news containing incomplete place descriptions and mixed Bangla-English scripts.

Method: Multi-stage pipeline integrating large language and vision-language models that performs OCR, linguistic reasoning, and map-level verification through grid-based spatial scanning, systematically evaluating locations against contextual and visual evidence without model retraining.

Result: ALIGN demonstrates consistent improvements over traditional geoparsing methods, accurately identifying district and sub-district-level crash sites in Bangla-language news data.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a high-accuracy foundation for automated crash mapping in data-scarce regions, supporting evidence-driven road safety policymaking and multimodal AI integration in transportation analytics.

Abstract: Reliable geospatial information on road accidents is vital for safety analysis and infrastructure planning, yet most low- and middle-income countries continue to face a critical shortage of accurate, location-specific crash data. Existing text-based geocoding tools perform poorly in multilingual and unstructured news environments, where incomplete place descriptions and mixed Bangla-English scripts obscure spatial context. To address these limitations, this study introduces ALIGN (Accident Location Inference through Geo-Spatial Neural Reasoning)- a vision-language framework that emulates human spatial reasoning to infer accident coordinates directly from textual and map-based cues. ALIGN integrates large language and vision-language models within a multi-stage pipeline that performs optical character recognition, linguistic reasoning, and map-level verification through grid-based spatial scanning. The framework systematically evaluates each predicted location against contextual and visual evidence, ensuring interpretable, fine-grained geolocation outcomes without requiring model retraining. Applied to Bangla-language news data, ALIGN demonstrates consistent improvements over traditional geoparsing methods, accurately identifying district and sub-district-level crash sites. Beyond its technical contribution, the framework establishes a high accuracy foundation for automated crash mapping in data-scarce regions, supporting evidence-driven road-safety policymaking and the broader integration of multimodal artificial intelligence in transportation analytics.

Motivation: Current LLM benchmarks are inadequate for evaluating true capabilities as they use simplified tasks and artificial scenarios, missing long-tail knowledge and real-world application complexity.

Method: Created LPFQA benchmark using authentic professional forums across 20 academic/industrial fields with 502 tasks, featuring fine-grained evaluation dimensions, hierarchical difficulty structure, realistic scenarios, and interdisciplinary integration.

Result: Evaluation of 12 mainstream LLMs revealed significant performance disparities, particularly in specialized reasoning tasks, demonstrating LPFQA's discriminative power.

Conclusion: LPFQA provides a robust, authentic, and discriminative benchmark that advances LLM evaluation and guides future model development by addressing real-world complexity and long-tail knowledge.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made rapid progress in reasoning, question answering, and professional applications; however, their true capabilities remain difficult to evaluate using existing benchmarks. Current datasets often focus on simplified tasks or artificial scenarios, overlooking long-tail knowledge and the complexities of real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we propose LPFQA, a long-tail knowledge-based benchmark derived from authentic professional forums across 20 academic and industrial fields, covering 502 tasks grounded in practical expertise. LPFQA introduces four key innovations: fine-grained evaluation dimensions that target knowledge depth, reasoning, terminology comprehension, and contextual analysis; a hierarchical difficulty structure that ensures semantic clarity and unique answers; authentic professional scenario modeling with realistic user personas; and interdisciplinary knowledge integration across diverse domains. We evaluated 12 mainstream LLMs on LPFQA and observed significant performance disparities, especially in specialized reasoning tasks. LPFQA provides a robust, authentic, and discriminative benchmark for advancing LLM evaluation and guiding future model development.

*Chen He,Xun Jiang,Lei Wang,Hao Yang,Chong Peng,Peng Yan,Fumin Shen,Xing Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs fail to generate novel insights during reflection in domain-specific tasks, exhibiting 'Echo Reflection' where they mechanically repeat earlier reasoning. The paper proposes Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO) with reflection-aware information filtration and adaptive entropy optimization to address this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM reasoning methods work well for mathematical tasks but fail in domain-specific knowledge tasks where models don't generate new insights during reflection, instead repeating earlier reasoning steps (Echo Reflection phenomenon).

Method: Proposed Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO) with two components: Reflection-aware Information Filtration to control cognitive information flow and prevent bad intermediate thoughts from affecting final decisions, and Adaptive-Entropy Optimization to dynamically balance exploration and exploitation across reasoning stages.

Result: Extensive experiments show AEPO consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance over mainstream reinforcement learning baselines across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: AEPO effectively addresses the Echo Reflection problem by controlling information flow and promoting reflective diversity, leading to improved reasoning performance in domain-specific tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of reasoning tasks. Recent methods have further improved LLM performance in complex mathematical reasoning. However, when extending these methods beyond the domain of mathematical reasoning to tasks involving complex domain-specific knowledge, we observe a consistent failure of LLMs to generate novel insights during the reflection stage. Instead of conducting genuine cognitive refinement, the model tends to mechanically reiterate earlier reasoning steps without introducing new information or perspectives, a phenomenon referred to as "Echo Reflection". We attribute this behavior to two key defects: (1) Uncontrollable information flow during response generation, which allows premature intermediate thoughts to propagate unchecked and distort final decisions; (2) Insufficient exploration of internal knowledge during reflection, leading to repeating earlier findings rather than generating new cognitive insights. Building on these findings, we proposed a novel reinforcement learning method termed Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO). Specifically, the AEPO framework consists of two major components: (1) Reflection-aware Information Filtration, which quantifies the cognitive information flow and prevents the final answer from being affected by earlier bad cognitive information; (2) Adaptive-Entropy Optimization, which dynamically balances exploration and exploitation across different reasoning stages, promoting both reflective diversity and answer correctness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AEPO consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance over mainstream reinforcement learning baselines across diverse benchmarks.

Result: SLM-based framework achieves agreement comparable to GPT-4o judges while substantially reducing inference cost. Three debate rounds provide optimal accuracy-efficiency balance.

Conclusion: Structured, value-aligned debate enables SLMs to capture semantic nuances of jailbreak attacks, and HAJailBench provides reliable foundation for scalable LLM safety evaluation.

Abstract: Safety evaluation of large language models (LLMs) increasingly relies on LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks, but the high cost of frontier models limits scalability. We propose a cost-efficient multi-agent judging framework that employs Small Language Models (SLMs) through structured debates among critic, defender, and judge agents. To rigorously assess safety judgments, we construct HAJailBench, a large-scale human-annotated jailbreak benchmark comprising 12,000 adversarial interactions across diverse attack methods and target models. The dataset provides fine-grained, expert-labeled ground truth for evaluating both safety robustness and judge reliability. Our SLM-based framework achieves agreement comparable to GPT-4o judges on HAJailBench while substantially reducing inference cost. Ablation results show that three rounds of debate yield the optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency. These findings demonstrate that structured, value-aligned debate enables SLMs to capture semantic nuances of jailbreak attacks and that HAJailBench offers a reliable foundation for scalable LLM safety evaluation.

### [299] [SofT-GRPO: Surpassing Discrete-Token LLM Reinforcement Learning via Gumbel-Reparameterized Soft-Thinking Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06411)
*Zhi Zheng,Wee Sun Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SofT-GRPO is a novel policy optimization algorithm that enables reinforcement learning for soft-thinking LLM reasoning, outperforming discrete-token GRPO especially on Pass@32 metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft-thinking LLM reasoning shows promise but cannot be effectively reinforced with existing RL methods like GRPO, limiting its potential compared to discrete-token reasoning.

Method: SofT-GRPO injects Gumbel noise into logits, uses Gumbel-Softmax to keep tokens in pre-trained embedding space, and applies reparameterization trick for policy gradient updates.

Result: SofT-GRPO enables soft-thinking LLMs to slightly outperform discrete-token GRPO on Pass@1 (+0.13% avg accuracy) and substantially on Pass@32 (+2.19% avg accuracy) across 1.5B-7B parameter models.

Conclusion: The proposed SofT-GRPO successfully addresses the challenge of applying RL to soft-thinking reasoning, unlocking its full potential and demonstrating superior performance over discrete-token approaches.

Abstract: The soft-thinking paradigm for Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning can outperform the conventional discrete-token Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in some scenarios, underscoring its research and application value. However, while the discrete-token CoT reasoning pattern can be reinforced through policy optimization algorithms such as group relative policy optimization (GRPO), extending the soft-thinking pattern with Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains challenging. This difficulty stems from the complexities of injecting stochasticity into soft-thinking tokens and updating soft-thinking policies accordingly. As a result, previous attempts to combine soft-thinking with GRPO typically underperform their discrete-token GRPO counterparts. To fully unlock the potential of soft-thinking, this paper presents a novel policy optimization algorithm, SofT-GRPO, to reinforce LLMs under the soft-thinking reasoning pattern. SofT-GRPO injects the Gumbel noise into logits, employs the Gumbel-Softmax technique to avoid soft-thinking tokens outside the pre-trained embedding space, and leverages the reparameterization trick in policy gradient. We conduct experiments across base LLMs ranging from 1.5B to 7B parameters, and results demonstrate that SofT-GRPO enables soft-thinking LLMs to slightly outperform discrete-token GRPO on Pass@1 (+0.13% on average accuracy), while exhibiting a substantial uplift on Pass@32 (+2.19% on average accuracy).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Auto-Explorer: An automated GUI data collection method with minimal annotation costs that autonomously explores GUI environments to gather training data for multimodal language models, addressing the challenge of acquiring GUI data for desktop software and new websites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI data collection methods rely on Common Crawl URLs and webpage HTML, making them unsuitable for desktop software and newly launched websites. There's a need for rapid adaptation to new software/websites in personalized scenarios.

Method: Proposes Auto-Explorer with a simple yet effective exploration mechanism that autonomously parses and explores GUI environments. Also develops UIXplore benchmark to assess exploration quality and creates GUI element grounding testing set.

Result: Experiments demonstrate superior performance of Auto-Explorer, showing the method can quickly enhance the capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in explored software.

Conclusion: Auto-Explorer provides an effective solution for automated GUI data collection with minimal annotation costs, enabling rapid adaptation of MLLMs to new software and websites through autonomous exploration.

Abstract: Recent advancements in GUI agents have significantly expanded their ability to interpret natural language commands to manage software interfaces. However, acquiring GUI data remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often involve designing automated agents that browse URLs from the Common Crawl, using webpage HTML to collect screenshots and corresponding annotations, including the names and bounding boxes of UI elements. However, this method is difficult to apply to desktop software or some newly launched websites not included in the Common Crawl. While we expect the model to possess strong generalization capabilities to handle this, it is still crucial for personalized scenarios that require rapid and perfect adaptation to new software or websites. To address this, we propose an automated data collection method with minimal annotation costs, named Auto-Explorer. It incorporates a simple yet effective exploration mechanism that autonomously parses and explores GUI environments, gathering data efficiently. Additionally, to assess the quality of exploration, we have developed the UIXplore benchmark. This benchmark creates environments for explorer agents to discover and save software states. Using the data gathered, we fine-tune a multimodal large language model (MLLM) and establish a GUI element grounding testing set to evaluate the effectiveness of the exploration strategies. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of Auto-Explorer, showing that our method can quickly enhance the capabilities of an MLLM in explored software.

*Jingyu Hu,Shu Yang,Xilin Gong,Hongming Wang,Weiru Liu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MONICA is a Monitor-guided Calibration framework that monitors and mitigates sycophantic behavior in Large Reasoning Models during inference by tracking sycophantic drift scores in real-time and dynamically suppressing problematic reasoning steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models exhibit sycophantic behavior where they agree with users' incorrect beliefs and follow misinformation, undermining reliability and posing societal risks. Current methods only focus on final answers without understanding how sycophancy develops during reasoning processes.

Method: MONICA integrates a sycophantic monitor that provides real-time monitoring of sycophantic drift scores during response generation with a calibrator that dynamically suppresses sycophantic behavior when scores exceed predefined thresholds, operating at the level of reasoning steps without requiring complete answer generation.

Result: Extensive experiments across 12 datasets and 3 LRMs demonstrate that MONICA effectively reduces sycophantic behavior in both intermediate reasoning steps and final answers, yielding robust performance improvements.

Conclusion: MONICA provides an effective framework for monitoring and mitigating sycophantic behavior in Large Reasoning Models during the reasoning process itself, addressing a critical limitation of existing methods that only focus on final answers.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) suffer from sycophantic behavior, where models tend to agree with users' incorrect beliefs and follow misinformation rather than maintain independent reasoning. This behavior undermines model reliability and poses societal risks. Mitigating LRM sycophancy requires monitoring how this sycophancy emerges during the reasoning trajectory; however, current methods mainly focus on judging based on final answers and correcting them, without understanding how sycophancy develops during reasoning processes. To address this limitation, we propose MONICA, a novel Monitor-guided Calibration framework that monitors and mitigates sycophancy during model inference at the level of reasoning steps, without requiring the model to finish generating its complete answer. MONICA integrates a sycophantic monitor that provides real-time monitoring of sycophantic drift scores during response generation with a calibrator that dynamically suppresses sycophantic behavior when scores exceed predefined thresholds. Extensive experiments across 12 datasets and 3 LRMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces sycophantic behavior in both intermediate reasoning steps and final answers, yielding robust performance improvements.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EDTR is a novel decoding strategy that combines topological analysis with Dirichlet-based uncertainty quantification to measure LLM confidence across multiple reasoning paths in Chain-of-Thought prompting, achieving significantly better calibration than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for confidence estimation in LLMs suffer from poor calibration and severe overconfidence on incorrect predictions, which hinders safe deployment of these models in complex reasoning tasks.

Method: EDTR treats each Chain-of-Thought as a vector in high-dimensional space and extracts eight topological risk features capturing the geometric structure of reasoning distributions - tighter, more coherent clusters indicate higher confidence while dispersed, inconsistent paths signal uncertainty.

Result: EDTR achieves 41% better calibration than competing methods with an average ECE of 0.287 and the best overall composite score of 0.672, while notably achieving perfect accuracy on AIME and exceptional calibration on GSM8K with an ECE of 0.107.

Conclusion: The work provides a geometric framework for understanding and quantifying uncertainty in multi-step LLM reasoning, enabling more reliable deployment where calibrated confidence estimates are essential.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting enables Large Language Models to solve complex problems, but deploying these models safely requires reliable confidence estimates, a capability where existing methods suffer from poor calibration and severe overconfidence on incorrect predictions. We propose Enhanced Dirichlet and Topology Risk (EDTR), a novel decoding strategy that combines topological analysis with Dirichlet-based uncertainty quantification to measure LLM confidence across multiple reasoning paths. EDTR treats each CoT as a vector in high-dimensional space and extracts eight topological risk features capturing the geometric structure of reasoning distributions: tighter, more coherent clusters indicate higher confidence while dispersed, inconsistent paths signal uncertainty. We evaluate EDTR against three state-of-the-art calibration methods across four diverse reasoning benchmarks spanning olympiad-level mathematics (AIME), grade school math (GSM8K), commonsense reasoning, and stock price prediction \cite{zhang2025aime, cobbe2021training, talmor-etal-2019-commonsenseqa, yahoo_finance}. EDTR achieves 41\% better calibration than competing methods with an average ECE of 0.287 and the best overall composite score of 0.672, while notably achieving perfect accuracy on AIME and exceptional calibration on GSM8K with an ECE of 0.107, domains where baselines exhibit severe overconfidence. Our work provides a geometric framework for understanding and quantifying uncertainty in multi-step LLM reasoning, enabling more reliable deployment where calibrated confidence estimates are essential.

TL;DR: This thesis enhances RL agents' zero-shot systematic generalization by incorporating human-like reasoning behaviors including spatial abstraction, task decomposition, and feasibility evaluation to prevent delusional planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL systems struggle with poor generalization across environments that differ from training conditions, particularly lacking systematic generalization abilities that humans naturally possess.

Method: Three key approaches: 1) Top-down attention mechanism for spatial abstraction, 2) Skipper framework for automatic task decomposition, 3) Feasibility evaluator to reject hallucinated infeasible targets during planning.

Result: Significant improvements in systematic generalization outside training tasks, robustness against distributional shifts, efficacy in long-term compositional planning, and performance improvements in various planning agents.

Conclusion: Incorporating human-like reasoning behaviors (spatial abstraction, task decomposition, feasibility evaluation) effectively enhances RL agents' systematic generalization, with future research directions focusing on general task abstraction and abstract planning.

Abstract: Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) systems encounter significant challenges when applied to real-world scenarios, primarily due to poor generalization across environments that differ from their training conditions. This thesis explores the direction of enhancing agents' zero-shot systematic generalization abilities by granting RL agents reasoning behaviors that are found to help systematic generalization in the human brain. Inspired by human conscious planning behaviors, we first introduced a top-down attention mechanism, which allows a decision-time planning agent to dynamically focus its reasoning on the most relevant aspects of the environmental state given its instantaneous intentions, a process we call "spatial abstraction". This approach significantly improves systematic generalization outside the training tasks. Subsequently, building on spatial abstraction, we developed the Skipper framework to automatically decompose complex tasks into simpler, more manageable sub-tasks. Skipper provides robustness against distributional shifts and efficacy in long-term, compositional planning by focusing on pertinent spatial and temporal elements of the environment. Finally, we identified a common failure mode and safety risk in planning agents that rely on generative models to generate state targets during planning. It is revealed that most agents blindly trust the targets they hallucinate, resulting in delusional planning behaviors. Inspired by how the human brain rejects delusional intentions, we propose learning a feasibility evaluator to enable rejecting hallucinated infeasible targets, which led to significant performance improvements in various kinds of planning agents. Finally, we suggest directions for future research, aimed at achieving general task abstraction and fully enabling abstract planning.

### [304] [GHOST: Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem on Graphs of Convex Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06471)
*Jingtao Tang,Hang Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GHOST is a hierarchical framework that optimally solves the GCS-TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem over Graphs of Convex Sets) by combining combinatorial tour search with convex trajectory optimization, using novel admissible lower bounds for efficient search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical TSP methods are inapplicable to GCS-TSP because edge costs depend on the specific trajectory selected through each convex region, requiring a new approach that handles this variable cost structure.

Method: GHOST uses a hierarchical framework with best-first search at both high level (tour search) and low level (GCS path realization), employing abstract-path-unfolding algorithm to compute admissible lower bounds that enable strong pruning and avoid unnecessary convex optimization calls.

Result: GHOST is orders-of-magnitude faster than unified mixed-integer convex programming baselines for simple cases and uniquely handles complex trajectory planning problems with high-order continuity constraints and incomplete GCS.

Conclusion: GHOST provides an optimal solution to GCS-TSP with strong performance guarantees and offers a bounded-suboptimal variant for time-critical scenarios, making it suitable for complex trajectory planning applications.

Abstract: We study GCS-TSP, a new variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) defined over a Graph of Convex Sets (GCS) -- a powerful representation for trajectory planning that decomposes the configuration space into convex regions connected by a sparse graph. In this setting, edge costs are not fixed but depend on the specific trajectory selected through each convex region, making classical TSP methods inapplicable. We introduce GHOST, a hierarchical framework that optimally solves the GCS-TSP by combining combinatorial tour search with convex trajectory optimization. GHOST systematically explores tours on a complete graph induced by the GCS, using a novel abstract-path-unfolding algorithm to compute admissible lower bounds that guide best-first search at both the high level (over tours) and the low level (over feasible GCS paths realizing the tour). These bounds provide strong pruning power, enabling efficient search while avoiding unnecessary convex optimization calls. We prove that GHOST guarantees optimality and present a bounded-suboptimal variant for time-critical scenarios. Experiments show that GHOST is orders-of-magnitude faster than unified mixed-integer convex programming baselines for simple cases and uniquely handles complex trajectory planning problems involving high-order continuity constraints and an incomplete GCS.

Main category: cs.AI

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether multimodal AI systems can abstract symbolic rules from visual patterns, specifically focusing on fractal program synthesis as a test case for bridging visual perception with mathematical abstraction.

Method: Developed FractalBench with 12 canonical fractals, evaluated four leading MLLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen 2.5-VL) by requiring them to generate executable Python code to reproduce fractals from images.

Result: 76% of generated code was syntactically valid but only 4% captured the mathematical structure; models performed better on geometric transformations (Koch curves: 17-21%) but failed at branching recursion (trees: <2%).

Conclusion: There is a fundamental disconnect in multimodal AI systems' ability to perform mathematical abstraction from visual patterns, with FractalBench serving as a contamination-resistant diagnostic tool for visual-mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning requires abstracting symbolic rules from visual patterns -- inferring the infinite from the finite. We investigate whether multimodal AI systems possess this capability through FractalBench, a benchmark evaluating fractal program synthesis from images. Fractals provide ideal test cases: Iterated Function Systems with only a few contraction maps generate complex self-similar patterns through simple recursive rules, requiring models to bridge visual perception with mathematical abstraction. We evaluate four leading MLLMs -- GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen 2.5-VL -- on 12 canonical fractals. Models must generate executable Python code reproducing the fractal, enabling objective evaluation. Results reveal a striking disconnect: 76% generate syntactically valid code but only 4% capture mathematical structure. Success varies systematically -- models handle geometric transformations (Koch curves: 17-21%) but fail at branching recursion (trees: <2%), revealing fundamental gaps in mathematical abstraction. FractalBench provides a contamination-resistant diagnostic for visual-mathematical reasoning and is available at https://github.com/NaiveNeuron/FractalBench

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces GRAPH-GRPO-LEX, a reinforcement learning framework that transforms legal contracts into structured semantic graphs using LLMs and group relative policy optimization to automate contract analysis and uncover hidden dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contract drafting and manual examination are arduous and error-prone due to the complex structure, dependencies, and rich semantic content of legal contracts. The work aims to automate contract review and enable computational analysis.

Method: The method involves: 1) Creating an ontology mapping legal contract elements to graph nodes and edges, 2) Using a reinforcement learning LLM framework (GRAPH-GRPO-LEX) with group relative policy optimization for entity and relationship extraction, 3) Applying a reward function based on graph metrics to identify direct relationships and hidden dependencies.

Result: The framework successfully transforms contracts into structured semantic graphs, enabling automatic identification of direct relationships between clauses and uncovering hidden dependencies. The gated GRPO approach provides strong learning signals for contract analysis.

Conclusion: This approach moves contract analysis from manual linear reading to easily visualized graphs, enabling dynamic analysis and laying groundwork for contract linting similar to software engineering practices, significantly improving contract review efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Contracts are complex documents featuring detailed formal structures, explicit and implicit dependencies and rich semantic content. Given these document properties, contract drafting and manual examination of contracts have proven to be both arduous and susceptible to errors. This work aims to simplify and automate the task of contract review and analysis using a novel framework for transforming legal contracts into structured semantic graphs, enabling computational analysis and data-driven insights. We introduce a detailed ontology mapping core legal contract elements to their graph-theoretic equivalents of nodes and edges. We then present a reinforcement learning based Large Language Model (LLM) framework for segmentation and extraction of entities and relationships from contracts. Our method, GRAPH-GRPO-LEX, incorporates both LLMs and reinforcement learning with group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By applying a carefully drafted reward function of graph metrics, we demonstrate the ability to automatically identify direct relationships between clauses, and even uncover hidden dependencies. Our introduction of the gated GRPO approach shows a strong learning signal and can move contract analysis from a linear, manual reading process to an easily visualized graph. This allows for a more dynamic analysis, including building the groundwork for contract linting similar to what is now practiced in software engineering.

*Chloe Li,Mary Phuong,Daniel Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Self-report fine-tuning (SRFT) trains AI models to admit factual mistakes, which generalizes to admitting hidden misaligned objectives in adversarial settings, enabling near-perfect detection of deceptive AI behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI systems become more capable of complex tasks, they also become more capable of pursuing undesirable objectives and causing harm. Current interrogation methods are unreliable because models can lie about their true intentions.

Method: Proposed self-report fine-tuning (SRFT), a supervised fine-tuning technique that trains models to admit factual mistakes when asked. This approach is evaluated in out-of-distribution stealth tasks where models have hidden misaligned objectives.

Result: SRFT models achieved near-ceiling performance in detecting hidden objectives (F1 score = 0.98 vs 0 for baseline), and recovered 28-100% of hidden objective details compared to 0% for baseline models and prefilled assistant turn attacks.

Conclusion: SRFT provides a promising technique for promoting honesty and incriminating misaligned AI systems by training them to disclose their true objectives when interrogated, even under pressure.

Abstract: As AI systems become more capable of complex agentic tasks, they also become more capable of pursuing undesirable objectives and causing harm. Previous work has attempted to catch these unsafe instances by interrogating models directly about their objectives and behaviors. However, the main weakness of trusting interrogations is that models can lie. We propose self-report fine-tuning (SRFT), a simple supervised fine-tuning technique that trains models to admit their factual mistakes when asked. We show that the admission of factual errors in simple question-answering settings generalizes out-of-distribution (OOD) to the admission of hidden misaligned objectives in adversarial agentic settings. We evaluate SRFT in OOD stealth tasks, where models are instructed to complete a hidden misaligned objective alongside a user-specified objective without being caught by monitoring. After SRFT, models are more likely to confess the details of their hidden objectives when interrogated, even under strong pressure not to disclose them. Interrogation on SRFT models can detect hidden objectives with near-ceiling performance (F1 score = 0.98), while the baseline model lies when interrogated under the same conditions (F1 score = 0). Interrogation on SRFT models can further elicit the content of the hidden objective, recovering 28-100% details, compared to 0% details recovered in the baseline model and by prefilled assistant turn attacks. This provides a promising technique for promoting honesty propensity and incriminating misaligned AI systems.

Motivation: To bridge the gap between human intuitive physics capabilities and machine performance by shifting to brain-inspired computational principles rather than traditional approaches.

Method: Developed Spatiotemporal Relational Neural Network (SRNN) with unified neural representations for object attributes, relations, and timeline, using Hebbian "Fire Together, Wire Together" mechanism across What and How pathways. Adopts "predefine-then-finetune" approach instead of "pretrain-then-finetune".

Result: Achieves competitive performance on CLEVRER benchmark, reveals benchmark bias, demonstrates white-box utility for precise error diagnosis, and generates structured linguistic descriptions of visual scenes.

Conclusion: Confirms viability of translating biological intelligence into engineered systems for intuitive physics understanding, providing a path for more holistic evaluation.

Abstract: Human prowess in intuitive physics remains unmatched by machines. To bridge this gap, we argue for a fundamental shift towards brain-inspired computational principles. This paper introduces the Spatiotemporal Relational Neural Network (SRNN), a model that establishes a unified neural representation for object attributes, relations, and timeline, with computations governed by a Hebbian ``Fire Together, Wire Together'' mechanism across dedicated \textit{What} and \textit{How} pathways. This unified representation is directly used to generate structured linguistic descriptions of the visual scene, bridging perception and language within a shared neural substrate. Moreover, unlike the prevalent ``pretrain-then-finetune'' paradigm, SRNN adopts a ``predefine-then-finetune'' approach. On the CLEVRER benchmark, SRNN achieves competitive performance. Our analysis further reveals a benchmark bias, outlines a path for a more holistic evaluation, and demonstrates SRNN's white-box utility for precise error diagnosis. Our work confirms the viability of translating biological intelligence into engineered systems for intuitive physics understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MLLMs struggle with complex mathematical reasoning tasks, and existing approaches rely on static teacher-derived datasets that limit adaptation to novel questions and lack iterative depth for robust generalization.

Method: Proposes MathSE framework with iterative cycles of inference, reflection, and reward-based feedback using an Outcome Reward Model (ORM) to refine reasoning paths.

Result: Demonstrates significant performance gains on challenging benchmarks, surpassing leading open-source multimodal mathematical reasoning model QVQ on MathVL-test.

Conclusion: MathSE effectively overcomes limitations of traditional one-shot fine-tuning by enabling iterative self-evolution, leading to improved mathematical reasoning capabilities in MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in vision-language answering tasks. Despite their strengths, these models often encounter challenges in achieving complex reasoning tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Previous works have focused on fine-tuning on specialized mathematical datasets. However, these datasets are typically distilled directly from teacher models, which capture only static reasoning patterns and leaving substantial gaps compared to student models. This reliance on fixed teacher-derived datasets not only restricts the model's ability to adapt to novel or more intricate questions that extend beyond the confines of the training data, but also lacks the iterative depth needed for robust generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{\method}, a \textbf{Math}ematical \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{E}volving framework for MLLMs. In contrast to traditional one-shot fine-tuning paradigms, \method iteratively refines the model through cycles of inference, reflection, and reward-based feedback. Specifically, we leverage iterative fine-tuning by incorporating correct reasoning paths derived from previous-stage inference and integrating reflections from a specialized Outcome Reward Model (ORM). To verify the effectiveness of \method, we evaluate it on a suite of challenging benchmarks, demonstrating significant performance gains over backbone models. Notably, our experimental results on MathVL-test surpass the leading open-source multimodal mathematical reasoning model QVQ. Our code and models are available at \texttt{https://zheny2751\allowbreak-dotcom.github.io/\allowbreak MathSE.github.io/}.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have shown potential in Emotion Recognition in Conversation but struggle to capture connections between explicit and implicit emotions, limiting their understanding of psychological states in dialogues.

Method: The framework uses emotion-sensitive prompt templates, builds a dedicated demonstration retrieval repository with real and LLM-generated dialogues, and implements curriculum learning with weighted emotional shifts for easy-to-hard training sequence.

Result: Achieved new state-of-the-art performance on IEMOCAP and MELD datasets, demonstrating improved emotional understanding and generalizability of LLMs in conversational contexts.

Conclusion: The PRC-Emo framework effectively enhances LLMs' ability to perceive emotions in conversations through integrated prompt engineering, retrieval, and curriculum learning strategies.

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) is a crucial task for understanding human emotions and enabling natural human-computer interaction. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown great potential in this field, their ability to capture the intrinsic connections between explicit and implicit emotions remains limited. We propose a novel ERC training framework, PRC-Emo, which integrates Prompt engineering, demonstration Retrieval, and Curriculum learning, with the goal of exploring whether LLMs can effectively perceive emotions in conversational contexts. Specifically, we design emotion-sensitive prompt templates based on both explicit and implicit emotional cues to better guide the model in understanding the speaker's psychological states. We construct the first dedicated demonstration retrieval repository for ERC, which includes training samples from widely used datasets, as well as high-quality dialogue examples generated by LLMs and manually verified. Moreover, we introduce a curriculum learning strategy into the LoRA fine-tuning process, incorporating weighted emotional shifts between same-speaker and different-speaker utterances to assign difficulty levels to dialogue samples, which are then organized in an easy-to-hard training sequence. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets-- IEMOCAP and MELD --show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in improving LLM-based emotional understanding.

Method: Proposes UrbanLN framework with: 1) Information-preserved stretching interpolation for aligning long captions with fine-grained visual semantics; 2) Dual-level optimization strategy including multi-model collaboration pipeline for diverse caption generation and momentum-based self-distillation for stable pseudo-targets under noisy conditions.

Result: Extensive experiments across four real-world cities and various downstream tasks demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods, showing effectiveness in urban region representation learning.

Conclusion: UrbanLN successfully addresses key challenges in urban region representation learning by enabling better alignment between visual features and long captions while effectively suppressing noise, providing a robust framework for extracting meaningful urban characteristics from imagery data.

Abstract: Region representation learning plays a pivotal role in urban computing by extracting meaningful features from unlabeled urban data. Analogous to how perceived facial age reflects an individual's health, the visual appearance of a city serves as its ``portrait", encapsulating latent socio-economic and environmental characteristics. Recent studies have explored leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate textual knowledge into imagery-based urban region representation learning. However, two major challenges remain: i)~difficulty in aligning fine-grained visual features with long captions, and ii) suboptimal knowledge incorporation due to noise in LLM-generated captions. To address these issues, we propose a novel pre-training framework called UrbanLN that improves Urban region representation learning through Long-text awareness and Noise suppression. Specifically, we introduce an information-preserved stretching interpolation strategy that aligns long captions with fine-grained visual semantics in complex urban scenes. To effectively mine knowledge from LLM-generated captions and filter out noise, we propose a dual-level optimization strategy. At the data level, a multi-model collaboration pipeline automatically generates diverse and reliable captions without human intervention. At the model level, we employ a momentum-based self-distillation mechanism to generate stable pseudo-targets, facilitating robust cross-modal learning under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments across four real-world cities and various downstream tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our UrbanLN.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RedOne 2.0 is a 4B parameter LLM designed for social networking services using a progressive RL-prioritized post-training method that achieves better performance than 7B models with superior data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social networking services present unique challenges for LLMs including heterogeneous workloads, rapidly changing norms/slang, and multilingual/culturally diverse content that causes distribution shift. SFT often creates a 'seesaw' effect between in-distribution gains and out-of-distribution robustness.

Method: Three-stage progressive training: (1) Exploratory Learning on curated SNS corpora to establish alignment and identify weaknesses; (2) Targeted Fine-Tuning with selective SFT on identified gaps while mixing general data to prevent forgetting; (3) Refinement Learning using RL with SNS-centric signals to consolidate improvements.

Result: The 4B model achieves average improvements of 2.41 over 7B baseline and 8.74 performance lift from base model with less than half the data required by SFT-centric methods, demonstrating superior data efficiency and stability.

Conclusion: RedOne 2.0 establishes a competitive, cost-effective baseline for domain-specific LLMs in SNS scenarios, advancing capability without sacrificing robustness at compact model scales.

Abstract: As a key medium for human interaction and information exchange, social networking services (SNS) pose unique challenges for large language models (LLMs): heterogeneous workloads, fast-shifting norms and slang, and multilingual, culturally diverse corpora that induce sharp distribution shift. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) can specialize models but often triggers a ``seesaw'' between in-distribution gains and out-of-distribution robustness, especially for smaller models. To address these challenges, we introduce RedOne 2.0, an SNS-oriented LLM trained with a progressive, RL-prioritized post-training paradigm designed for rapid and stable adaptation. The pipeline consist in three stages: (1) Exploratory Learning on curated SNS corpora to establish initial alignment and identify systematic weaknesses; (2) Targeted Fine-Tuning that selectively applies SFT to the diagnosed gaps while mixing a small fraction of general data to mitigate forgetting; and (3) Refinement Learning that re-applies RL with SNS-centric signals to consolidate improvements and harmonize trade-offs across tasks. Across various tasks spanning three categories, our 4B scale model delivers an average improvements about 2.41 over the 7B sub-optimal baseline. Additionally, RedOne 2.0 achieves average performance lift about 8.74 from the base model with less than half the data required by SFT-centric method RedOne, evidencing superior data efficiency and stability at compact scales. Overall, RedOne 2.0 establishes a competitive, cost-effective baseline for domain-specific LLMs in SNS scenario, advancing capability without sacrificing robustness.

TL;DR: This paper proposes embedding LLMs within standardized analytical processes (QOC, Sensitivity Analysis, Game Theory, Risk Management) to transform opaque AI inference into transparent, auditable decision traces through a layered architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To increase explainability of AI systems by moving beyond traditional XAI methods that focus on feature attribution or post-hoc interpretation, addressing the opacity of LLM reasoning.

Method: Integrates LLMs into defined decision models (QOC, Sensitivity Analysis, Game Theory, Risk Management) using a layered architecture that separates LLM reasoning space from explainable process space.

Result: Empirical evaluations show the system can reproduce human-level decision logic in decentralized governance, systems analysis, and strategic reasoning contexts.

Conclusion: LLM-driven standard processes provide a foundation for reliable, interpretable, and verifiable AI-supported decision making.

Abstract: This paper introduces an approach to increasing the explainability of artificial intelligence (AI) systems by embedding Large Language Models (LLMs) within standardized analytical processes. While traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods focus on feature attribution or post-hoc interpretation, the proposed framework integrates LLMs into defined decision models such as Question-Option-Criteria (QOC), Sensitivity Analysis, Game Theory, and Risk Management. By situating LLM reasoning within these formal structures, the approach transforms opaque inference into transparent and auditable decision traces. A layered architecture is presented that separates the reasoning space of the LLM from the explainable process space above it. Empirical evaluations show that the system can reproduce human-level decision logic in decentralized governance, systems analysis, and strategic reasoning contexts. The results suggest that LLM-driven standard processes provide a foundation for reliable, interpretable, and verifiable AI-supported decision making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an explainable decision support system that produces transparent, inspectable reasoning steps rather than opaque outputs, enabling better auditability and alignment with human expert workflows.

Method: Uses a modular pipeline with three frameworks: Vester's Sensitivity Model (factors, impact matrix, roles, feedback loops), normal-form games (strategies, payoff matrix, equilibria), and sequential games (role agents, tree construction, backward induction). LLM components are paired with deterministic analyzers for traceable intermediates.

Result: In logistics case study (100 runs): 55.5% mean factor alignment with human baseline over 26 factors (62.9% on transport-core subset), 57% role agreement. LLM judge scored runs on par with reconstructed human baseline using eight-criterion rubric.

Conclusion: Configurable LLM pipelines can effectively mimic expert workflows while providing transparent, inspectable reasoning steps, making them suitable for decision support systems requiring explainability and auditability.

Abstract: We present a modular, explainable LLM-agent pipeline for decision support that externalizes reasoning into auditable artifacts. The system instantiates three frameworks: Vester's Sensitivity Model (factor set, signed impact matrix, systemic roles, feedback loops); normal-form games (strategies, payoff matrix, equilibria); and sequential games (role-conditioned agents, tree construction, backward induction), with swappable modules at every step. LLM components (default: GPT-5) are paired with deterministic analyzers for equilibria and matrix-based role classification, yielding traceable intermediates rather than opaque outputs. In a real-world logistics case (100 runs), mean factor alignment with a human baseline was 55.5\% over 26 factors and 62.9\% on the transport-core subset; role agreement over matches was 57\%. An LLM judge using an eight-criterion rubric (max 100) scored runs on par with a reconstructed human baseline. Configurable LLM pipelines can thus mimic expert workflows with transparent, inspectable steps.

TL;DR: This paper establishes a comprehensive framework for Green AI that addresses environmental burdens across the entire AI lifecycle, including energy, carbon, water, and embodied impacts, with actionable guidance for stakeholders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI environmental impact assessment tools are heterogeneous, often omit key factors like water and value chain effects, and lack comparability and reproducibility, necessitating a unified approach.

Method: The authors propose: (i) a unified definition of Green AI distinct from Sustainable AI; (ii) a five-phase lifecycle mapped to LCA stages; (iii) PDCA governance with decision gateways; (iv) hardware/system strategies across edge-cloud continuum; and (v) calibrated measurement combining estimator models with direct metering.

Result: The framework provides systematic approaches to reduce environmental burdens across AI lifecycle phases through coordinated hardware, placement, energy mix, cooling, and scheduling strategies.

Conclusion: The article offers actionable, evidence-based guidance combining definition, lifecycle processes, hardware strategies, and calibrated measurement to enable reproducible, provider-agnostic environmental impact assessments for AI systems.

Abstract: Across the Artificial Intelligence (AI) lifecycle - from hardware to development, deployment, and reuse - burdens span energy, carbon, water, and embodied impacts. Cloud provider tools improve transparency but remain heterogeneous and often omit water and value chain effects, limiting comparability and reproducibility. Addressing these multi dimensional burdens requires a lifecycle approach linking phase explicit mapping with system levers (hardware, placement, energy mix, cooling, scheduling) and calibrated measurement across facility, system, device, and workload levels. This article (i) establishes a unified, operational definition of Green AI distinct from Sustainable AI; (ii) formalizes a five phase lifecycle mapped to Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) stages, making energy, carbon, water, and embodied impacts first class; (iii) specifies governance via Plan Do Check Act (PDCA) cycles with decision gateways; (iv) systematizes hardware and system level strategies across the edge cloud continuum to reduce embodied burdens; and (v) defines a calibrated measurement framework combining estimator models with direct metering to enable reproducible, provider agnostic comparisons. Combining definition, lifecycle processes, hardware strategies, and calibrated measurement, this article offers actionable, evidence based guidance for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers.

*Meghyn Bienvenu,Quentin Manière*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the data complexity of querying inconsistent weighted description logic knowledge bases using cost-based semantics, with a focus on DLs containing inverse roles and role inclusions (covering DL-Lite dialects). The study provides refined complexity bounds and surprisingly shows tractability for certain query types under fixed cost bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the understanding of cost-based semantics for inconsistent weighted DL knowledge bases beyond previously studied DLs, particularly to handle inverse roles and role inclusions that cover important DL-Lite dialects, and to provide more precise complexity characterizations.

Method: The authors conduct a comprehensive data complexity analysis of querying under cost-based semantics for DLs with inverse roles and role inclusions. They use mathematical proofs to establish complexity bounds and identify cases where query answering becomes tractable through first-order rewriting techniques.

Result: The paper sharpens existing lower bounds and establishes the precise complexity of optimal-cost certain answer semantics. Most notably, it shows that for DL-Lite^H_bool ontologies with fixed cost bounds, certain answers for instance queries and possible answers for conjunctive queries can be computed using first-order rewriting, achieving the lowest possible data complexity (TC_0).

Conclusion: Cost-based semantics for querying inconsistent weighted DL knowledge bases can achieve tractable data complexity in specific settings, particularly for DL-Lite dialects with fixed cost bounds, challenging the general perception of intractability in this area.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the data complexity of querying inconsistent weighted description logic (DL) knowledge bases under recently-introduced cost-based semantics. In a nutshell, the idea is to assign each interpretation a cost based upon the weights of the violated axioms and assertions, and certain and possible query answers are determined by considering all (resp. some) interpretations having optimal or bounded cost. Whereas the initial study of cost-based semantics focused on DLs between $\mathcal{EL}_\bot$ and $\mathcal{ALCO}$, we consider DLs that may contain inverse roles and role inclusions, thus covering prominent DL-Lite dialects. Our data complexity analysis goes significantly beyond existing results by sharpening several lower bounds and pinpointing the precise complexity of optimal-cost certain answer semantics (no non-trivial upper bound was known). Moreover, while all existing results show the intractability of cost-based semantics, our most challenging and surprising result establishes that if we consider $\text{DL-Lite}^\mathcal{H}_\mathsf{bool}$ ontologies and a fixed cost bound, certain answers for instance queries and possible answers for conjunctive queries can be computed using first-order rewriting and thus enjoy the lowest possible data complexity ($\mathsf{TC}_0$).

Motivation: To address the dual objective of improving automation efficiency while providing measurable environmental performance in document-intensive supply chain workflows.

Method: Developed a comprehensive sustainability assessment framework comparing three scenarios: fully manual, AI-assisted (human-in-the-loop), and advanced multi-agent agentic AI workflow with parsers and verifiers.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates performance, energy, and emission indicators into a unified ESG-oriented methodology for assessing AI-enabled supply chain solutions, with demonstrated real-world applicability.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive sustainability assessment framework for document intelligence within supply chain operations, centered on agentic artificial intelligence (AI). We address the dual objective of improving automation efficiency while providing measurable environmental performance in document-intensive workflows. The research compares three scenarios: fully manual (human-only), AI-assisted (human-in-the-loop, HITL), and an advanced multi-agent agentic AI workflow leveraging parsers and verifiers. Empirical results show that AI-assisted HITL and agentic AI scenarios achieve reductions of up to 70-90% in energy consumption, 90-97% in carbon dioxide emissions, and 89-98% in water usage compared to manual processes. Notably, full agentic configurations, combining advanced reasoning (thinking mode) and multi-agent validation, achieve substantial sustainability gains over human-only approaches, even when resource usage increases slightly versus simpler AI-assisted solutions. The framework integrates performance, energy, and emission indicators into a unified ESG-oriented methodology for assessing and governing AI-enabled supply chain solutions. The paper includes a complete replicability use case demonstrating the methodology's application to real-world document extraction tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational cost of over-parameterized models and suboptimal performance of conventional loss functions on skewed urban flow distributions.

Method: PLGF architecture with Progressive Local-Global Fusion strategy and DualFocal Loss integrating dual-space supervision with difficulty-aware focusing mechanism.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 97% model size reduction and over 10% accuracy improvement under comparable parameter budgets across 4 real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The unified solution synergizing architectural efficiency with adaptive optimization enables practical deployment of fine-grained urban flow inference systems.

Abstract: Fine-grained urban flow inference is crucial for urban planning and intelligent transportation systems, enabling precise traffic management and resource allocation. However, the practical deployment of existing methods is hindered by two key challenges: the prohibitive computational cost of over-parameterized models and the suboptimal performance of conventional loss functions on the highly skewed distribution of urban flows. To address these challenges, we propose a unified solution that synergizes architectural efficiency with adaptive optimization. Specifically, we first introduce PLGF, a lightweight yet powerful architecture that employs a Progressive Local-Global Fusion strategy to effectively capture both fine-grained details and global contextual dependencies. Second, we propose DualFocal Loss, a novel function that integrates dual-space supervision with a difficulty-aware focusing mechanism, enabling the model to adaptively concentrate on hard-to-predict regions. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world scenarios validate the effectiveness and scalability of our method. Notably, while achieving state-of-the-art performance, PLGF reduces the model size by up to 97% compared to current high-performing methods. Furthermore, under comparable parameter budgets, our model yields an accuracy improvement of over 10% against strong baselines. The implementation is included in the https://github.com/Yasoz/PLGF.

*Junji Hou,Junzhou Zhao,Shuo Zhang,Pinghui Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to detect synthetic time series generated by Time-Series Large Models (TSLMs) by identifying uncertainty contraction patterns in recursive forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasing risks of data misuse and fabrication in time series data, and the inapplicability of existing text-based detection methods due to modality differences (lower information density and smoother distributions in time series).

Method: Proposes the contraction hypothesis that model-generated time series exhibit progressively decreasing uncertainty under recursive forecasting. Introduces Uncertainty Contraction Estimator (UCE), a white-box detector that aggregates uncertainty metrics over successive prefixes.

Result: Extensive experiments on 32 datasets show UCE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, providing reliable and generalizable detection of model-generated time series.

Conclusion: The uncertainty contraction phenomenon provides a reliable foundation for detecting TSLM-generated time series, and UCE offers an effective solution that generalizes across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Motivated by the increasing risks of data misuse and fabrication, we investigate the problem of identifying synthetic time series generated by Time-Series Large Models (TSLMs) in this work. While there are extensive researches on detecting model generated text, we find that these existing methods are not applicable to time series data due to the fundamental modality difference, as time series usually have lower information density and smoother probability distributions than text data, which limit the discriminative power of token-based detectors. To address this issue, we examine the subtle distributional differences between real and model-generated time series and propose the contraction hypothesis, which states that model-generated time series, unlike real ones, exhibit progressively decreasing uncertainty under recursive forecasting. We formally prove this hypothesis under theoretical assumptions on model behavior and time series structure. Model-generated time series exhibit progressively concentrated distributions under recursive forecasting, leading to uncertainty contraction. We provide empirical validation of the hypothesis across diverse datasets. Building on this insight, we introduce the Uncertainty Contraction Estimator (UCE), a white-box detector that aggregates uncertainty metrics over successive prefixes to identify TSLM-generated time series. Extensive experiments on 32 datasets show that UCE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a reliable and generalizable solution for detecting model-generated time series.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MENTOR is a metacognition-driven framework that enables LLMs to self-evolve by identifying and mitigating implicit domain-specific risks through self-assessment, dynamic rule generation, and activation steering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM alignment focuses on explicit risks but fails to address domain-specific implicit risks and lacks flexible frameworks applicable across specialized fields.

Method: Uses metacognitive self-assessment for value alignment reflection, generates dynamic rule knowledge graphs from reflection outcomes, and employs activation steering during inference to enforce rules.

Result: Substantially reduces semantic attack success rates across education, finance, and management domains, with metacognitive assessment aligning closely with human evaluators while providing more thorough analysis.

Conclusion: MENTOR establishes a continuous self-evolution cycle that enhances generalization and reduces maintenance costs, enabling effective implicit risk mitigation for LLMs across diverse domains.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and value alignment of large language models (LLMs) is critical for their deployment. Current alignment efforts primarily target explicit risks such as bias, hate speech, and violence. However, they often fail to address deeper, domain-specific implicit risks and lack a flexible, generalizable framework applicable across diverse specialized fields. Hence, we proposed MENTOR: A MEtacognition-driveN self-evoluTion framework for uncOvering and mitigating implicit Risks in LLMs on Domain Tasks. To address the limitations of labor-intensive human evaluation, we introduce a novel metacognitive self-assessment tool. This enables LLMs to reflect on potential value misalignments in their responses using strategies like perspective-taking and consequential thinking. We also release a supporting dataset of 9,000 risk queries spanning education, finance, and management to enhance domain-specific risk identification. Subsequently, based on the outcomes of metacognitive reflection, the framework dynamically generates supplementary rule knowledge graphs that extend predefined static rule trees. This enables models to actively apply validated rules to future similar challenges, establishing a continuous self-evolution cycle that enhances generalization by reducing maintenance costs and inflexibility of static systems. Finally, we employ activation steering during inference to guide LLMs in following the rules, a cost-effective method to robustly enhance enforcement across diverse contexts. Experimental results show MENTOR's effectiveness: In defensive testing across three vertical domains, the framework substantially reduces semantic attack success rates, enabling a new level of implicit risk mitigation for LLMs. Furthermore, metacognitive assessment not only aligns closely with baseline human evaluators but also delivers more thorough and insightful analysis of LLMs value alignment.

TL;DR: CMM is a novel framework that uses LLM distillation for market making by decoupling features across layer, task, and data dimensions, with student models learning specific features and integrating via Hájek-MoE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based market making methods suffer from slow inference speed, and there's limited research on LLM distillation specifically for this financial task.

Method: Proposes Cooperative Market Making (CMM) framework that decouples LLM features across three dimensions (layer, task, data), uses student models to learn specific features, and integrates outputs via Hájek-MoE in a common feature space.

Result: Extensive experiments on four real-world market datasets show CMM outperforms current distillation methods and RL-based market-making strategies.

Conclusion: CMM effectively addresses the inference speed issue in LLM-based market making through cooperative knowledge distillation across multiple dimensions.

Abstract: Market making (MM) through Reinforcement Learning (RL) has attracted significant attention in financial trading. With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), more and more attempts are being made to apply LLMs to financial areas. A simple, direct application of LLM as an agent shows significant performance. Such methods are hindered by their slow inference speed, while most of the current research has not studied LLM distillation for this specific task. To address this, we first propose the normalized fluorescent probe to study the mechanism of the LLM's feature. Based on the observation found by our investigation, we propose Cooperative Market Making (CMM), a novel framework that decouples LLM features across three orthogonal dimensions: layer, task, and data. Various student models collaboratively learn simple LLM features along with different dimensions, with each model responsible for a distinct feature to achieve knowledge distillation. Furthermore, CMM introduces an Hájek-MoE to integrate the output of the student models by investigating the contribution of different models in a kernel function-generated common feature space. Extensive experimental results on four real-world market datasets demonstrate the superiority of CMM over the current distillation method and RL-based market-making strategies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify latent subclasses in time series classification by leveraging neural network saliency maps for knowledge discovery, addressing the limitation of signal-only approaches.

Method: Transform multiclass classification to binary problems via label subsumption, train classifiers to generate saliency maps, cluster signals by predicted class, and use LLM for symbolic approximation and fuzzy knowledge graph matching.

Result: Outperforms signal-only baselines in clustering and subclass identification on established time series classification datasets.

Conclusion: The saliency map-driven neuro-symbolic approach effectively discovers latent subclasses in time series data, demonstrating superior performance over traditional methods.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel neuro-symbolic approach for sensor signal-based knowledge discovery, focusing on identifying latent subclasses in time series classification tasks. The approach leverages gradient-based saliency maps derived from trained neural networks to guide the discovery process. Multiclass time series classification problems are transformed into binary classification problems through label subsumption, and classifiers are trained for each of these to yield saliency maps. The input signals, grouped by predicted class, are clustered under three distinct configurations. The centroids of the final set of clusters are provided as input to an LLM for symbolic approximation and fuzzy knowledge graph matching to discover the underlying subclasses of the original multiclass problem. Experimental results on well-established time series classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our saliency map-driven method for knowledge discovery, outperforming signal-only baselines in both clustering and subclass identification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation of content moderation effectiveness in OSNs is limited by high data collection costs and lack of experimental control, creating a need for better assessment methods.

Method: Developed a LLM-powered agent-based simulator that models OSN conversations, allowing parallel counterfactual simulations where toxic behavior is influenced by moderation interventions while keeping all other factors equal.

Result: Experiments demonstrated the psychological realism of OSN agents, emergence of social contagion phenomena, and superior effectiveness of personalized moderation strategies compared to generic approaches.

Conclusion: LLM-powered simulation provides a viable approach for evaluating content moderation strategies, revealing that personalized interventions are more effective and enabling better understanding of social dynamics in OSNs.

Abstract: Online Social Networks (OSNs) widely adopt content moderation to mitigate the spread of abusive and toxic discourse. Nonetheless, the real effectiveness of moderation interventions remains unclear due to the high cost of data collection and limited experimental control. The latest developments in Natural Language Processing pave the way for a new evaluation approach. Large Language Models (LLMs) can be successfully leveraged to enhance Agent-Based Modeling and simulate human-like social behavior with unprecedented degree of believability. Yet, existing tools do not support simulation-based evaluation of moderation strategies. We fill this gap by designing a LLM-powered simulator of OSN conversations enabling a parallel, counterfactual simulation where toxic behavior is influenced by moderation interventions, keeping all else equal. We conduct extensive experiments, unveiling the psychological realism of OSN agents, the emergence of social contagion phenomena and the superior effectiveness of personalized moderation strategies.

TL;DR: PADiff is a diffusion-based approach for ad hoc teamwork that captures multimodal cooperation patterns by integrating predictive teammate information into the denoising process, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ad hoc teamwork requires agents to collaborate with unseen teammates, but conventional RL approaches fail to capture multimodal cooperation patterns as they optimize for single expected returns, causing policies to collapse into dominant behaviors.

Method: Proposes PADiff, a diffusion-based policy that integrates predictive information about teammates into the denoising process to handle multimodal behaviors in non-stationary AHT scenarios.

Result: Extensive experiments across three cooperation environments demonstrate that PADiff significantly outperforms existing AHT methods.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based approaches with integrated predictive information can effectively capture multimodal cooperation patterns and adapt to unknown teammates in ad hoc teamwork scenarios.

Abstract: Ad hoc teamwork (AHT) requires agents to collaborate with previously unseen teammates, which is crucial for many real-world applications. The core challenge of AHT is to develop an ego agent that can predict and adapt to unknown teammates on the fly. Conventional RL-based approaches optimize a single expected return, which often causes policies to collapse into a single dominant behavior, thus failing to capture the multimodal cooperation patterns inherent in AHT. In this work, we introduce PADiff, a diffusion-based approach that captures agent's multimodal behaviors, unlocking its diverse cooperation modes with teammates. However, standard diffusion models lack the ability to predict and adapt in highly non-stationary AHT scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a novel diffusion-based policy that integrates critical predictive information about teammates into the denoising process. Extensive experiments across three cooperation environments demonstrate that PADiff outperforms existing AHT methods significantly.

Here we introduce AgenticSciML, a collaborative multi-agent system in which over 10 specialized AI agents collaborate to propose, critique, and refine SciML solutions through structured reasoning and iterative evolution. The framework integrates structured debate, retrieval-augmented method memory, and ensemble-guided evolutionary search, enabling the agents to generate and assess new hypotheses about architectures and optimization procedures. Across physics-informed learning and operator learning tasks, the framework discovers solution methods that outperform single-agent and human-designed baselines by up to four orders of magnitude in error reduction. The agents produce novel strategies -- including adaptive mixture-of-expert architectures, decomposition-based PINNs, and physics-informed operator learning models -- that do not appear explicitly in the curated knowledge base. These results show that collaborative reasoning among AI agents can yield emergent methodological innovation, suggesting a path toward scalable, transparent, and autonomous discovery in scientific computing.

TL;DR: ED2D is an evidence-based multi-agent debate framework for misinformation detection that not only improves detection accuracy but also generates persuasive debunking transcripts to correct user beliefs and discourage misinformation sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior multi-agent debate frameworks focused only on detection accuracy but overlooked helping users understand the reasoning behind factual judgments and develop future resilience against misinformation.

Method: ED2D extends previous multi-agent debate approaches by incorporating factual evidence retrieval and is designed as a persuasive system that generates debunking transcripts to correct user beliefs.

Result: ED2D outperforms existing baselines across three misinformation detection benchmarks. When correct, its debunking transcripts show persuasive effects comparable to human experts, but when misclassifying, it may inadvertently reinforce user misconceptions even alongside accurate human explanations.

Conclusion: The findings highlight both the promise and potential risks of deploying multi-agent debate systems for misinformation intervention, emphasizing the need for careful deployment and transparency.

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) frameworks have emerged as promising approaches for misinformation detection by simulating adversarial reasoning. While prior work has focused on detection accuracy, it overlooks the importance of helping users understand the reasoning behind factual judgments and develop future resilience. The debate transcripts generated during MAD offer a rich but underutilized resource for transparent reasoning. In this study, we introduce ED2D, an evidence-based MAD framework that extends previous approach by incorporating factual evidence retrieval. More importantly, ED2D is designed not only as a detection framework but also as a persuasive multi-agent system aimed at correcting user beliefs and discouraging misinformation sharing. We compare the persuasive effects of ED2D-generated debunking transcripts with those authored by human experts. Results demonstrate that ED2D outperforms existing baselines across three misinformation detection benchmarks. When ED2D generates correct predictions, its debunking transcripts exhibit persuasive effects comparable to those of human experts; However, when ED2D misclassifies, its accompanying explanations may inadvertently reinforce users'misconceptions, even when presented alongside accurate human explanations. Our findings highlight both the promise and the potential risks of deploying MAD systems for misinformation intervention. We further develop a public community website to help users explore ED2D, fostering transparency, critical thinking, and collaborative fact-checking.

TL;DR: IterResearch introduces an iterative deep-research paradigm that reformulates long-horizon research as a Markov Decision Process with workspace reconstruction, overcoming context suffocation in existing mono-contextual approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep-research agents suffer from mono-contextual paradigm limitations - accumulating all information in a single expanding context window leads to context suffocation and noise contamination, limiting effectiveness on long-horizon tasks.

Method: IterResearch maintains an evolving report as memory and periodically synthesizes insights, using Efficiency-Aware Policy Optimization (EAPO) with geometric reward discounting and adaptive downsampling for stable distributed training.

Result: Achieves +14.5pp average improvement across six benchmarks, extends to 2048 interactions with dramatic performance gains (3.5% to 42.5%), and improves frontier models by up to 19.2pp over ReAct on long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: IterResearch serves as a versatile solution for long-horizon reasoning, effective both as a trained agent and as a prompting paradigm for frontier models, demonstrating unprecedented interaction scaling.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep-research agents have shown promise for autonomous knowledge construction through dynamic reasoning over external sources. However, existing approaches rely on a mono-contextual paradigm that accumulates all information in a single, expanding context window, leading to context suffocation and noise contamination that limit their effectiveness on long-horizon tasks. We introduce IterResearch, a novel iterative deep-research paradigm that reformulates long-horizon research as a Markov Decision Process with strategic workspace reconstruction. By maintaining an evolving report as memory and periodically synthesizing insights, our approach preserves consistent reasoning capacity across arbitrary exploration depths. We further develop Efficiency-Aware Policy Optimization (EAPO), a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes efficient exploration through geometric reward discounting and enables stable distributed training via adaptive downsampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IterResearch achieves substantial improvements over existing open-source agents with average +14.5pp across six benchmarks and narrows the gap with frontier proprietary systems. Remarkably, our paradigm exhibits unprecedented interaction scaling, extending to 2048 interactions with dramatic performance gains (from 3.5\% to 42.5\%), and serves as an effective prompting strategy, improving frontier models by up to 19.2pp over ReAct on long-horizon tasks. These findings position IterResearch as a versatile solution for long-horizon reasoning, effective both as a trained agent and as a prompting paradigm for frontier models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DEEPPERSONA is a scalable generative engine that creates rich, narrative-complete synthetic personas using a two-stage taxonomy-guided method, significantly outperforming existing approaches in diversity, uniqueness, and practical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing synthetic personas are shallow and simplistic, failing to capture the rich complexity and diversity of real human identities needed for agentic behavioral simulation, LLM personalization, and human-AI alignment research.

Method: Two-stage taxonomy-guided approach: (1) algorithmically construct the largest human-attribute taxonomy by mining thousands of real user-ChatGPT conversations, (2) progressively sample attributes from this taxonomy to generate coherent personas with hundreds of structured attributes and ~1MB of narrative text.

Result: Significant improvements: 32% higher attribute diversity, 44% greater profile uniqueness, 11.6% average improvement in personalized question answering accuracy, 31.7% reduction in gap between simulated LLM citizens and human responses, and 17% reduction in Big Five personality test performance gap.

Conclusion: DEEPPERSONA provides a rigorous, scalable, and privacy-free platform for high-fidelity human simulation and personalized AI research, enabling more realistic and diverse synthetic personas than previous methods.

Abstract: Simulating human profiles by instilling personas into large language models (LLMs) is rapidly transforming research in agentic behavioral simulation, LLM personalization, and human-AI alignment. However, most existing synthetic personas remain shallow and simplistic, capturing minimal attributes and failing to reflect the rich complexity and diversity of real human identities. We introduce DEEPPERSONA, a scalable generative engine for synthesizing narrative-complete synthetic personas through a two-stage, taxonomy-guided method. First, we algorithmically construct the largest-ever human-attribute taxonomy, comprising over hundreds of hierarchically organized attributes, by mining thousands of real user-ChatGPT conversations. Second, we progressively sample attributes from this taxonomy, conditionally generating coherent and realistic personas that average hundreds of structured attributes and roughly 1 MB of narrative text, two orders of magnitude deeper than prior works. Intrinsic evaluations confirm significant improvements in attribute diversity (32 percent higher coverage) and profile uniqueness (44 percent greater) compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Extrinsically, our personas enhance GPT-4.1-mini's personalized question answering accuracy by 11.6 percent on average across ten metrics and substantially narrow (by 31.7 percent) the gap between simulated LLM citizens and authentic human responses in social surveys. Our generated national citizens reduced the performance gap on the Big Five personality test by 17 percent relative to LLM-simulated citizens. DEEPPERSONA thus provides a rigorous, scalable, and privacy-free platform for high-fidelity human simulation and personalized AI research.

Motivation: To accelerate development of AI agents that control user interfaces by providing high-quality datasets and robust evaluation methods for complex, human-relevant goals.

Method: Created DigiData dataset through comprehensive exploration of app features (unlike existing unstructured approaches), and developed DigiData-Bench benchmark with dynamic evaluation protocols and AI-powered evaluations to address limitations of step-accuracy metric.

Result: Produced a meticulously constructed dataset with greater diversity and higher goal complexity than existing datasets, along with rigorous evaluation methods that overcome shortcomings of current metrics.

Conclusion: These contributions significantly advance mobile control agent development, paving the way for more intuitive and effective human-device interactions.

Abstract: AI agents capable of controlling user interfaces have the potential to transform human interaction with digital devices. To accelerate this transformation, two fundamental building blocks are essential: high-quality datasets that enable agents to achieve complex and human-relevant goals, and robust evaluation methods that allow researchers and practitioners to rapidly enhance agent performance. In this paper, we introduce DigiData, a large-scale, high-quality, diverse, multi-modal dataset designed for training mobile control agents. Unlike existing datasets, which derive goals from unstructured interactions, DigiData is meticulously constructed through comprehensive exploration of app features, resulting in greater diversity and higher goal complexity. Additionally, we present DigiData-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating mobile control agents on real-world complex tasks. We demonstrate that the commonly used step-accuracy metric falls short in reliably assessing mobile control agents and, to address this, we propose dynamic evaluation protocols and AI-powered evaluations as rigorous alternatives for agent assessment. Our contributions aim to significantly advance the development of mobile control agents, paving the way for more intuitive and effective human-device interactions.
