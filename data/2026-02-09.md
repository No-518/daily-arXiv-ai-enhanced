TL;DR: SuperHead enhances low-resolution 3D talking head avatars using dynamics-aware 3D inversion with pre-trained generative models to produce high-quality, animatable 3D Gaussian Splatting avatars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-quality image/video sources lead to poor 3D reconstructions of talking heads, hindering immersive applications. Existing super-resolution techniques can't handle dynamic 3D inputs.

Method: Uses dynamics-aware 3D inversion to optimize latent representations from pre-trained 3D generative models, producing super-resolved 3D Gaussian Splatting head models rigged to FLAME for animation, supervised by upscaled 2D renderings and depth maps.

Result: Generates avatars with fine-grained facial details under dynamic motions, significantly outperforming baseline methods in visual quality.

Conclusion: SuperHead effectively addresses the challenge of enhancing low-resolution animatable 3D head avatars while maintaining 3D/temporal consistency and preserving identity during animation.

Abstract: Creating high-fidelity, animatable 3D talking heads is crucial for immersive applications, yet often hindered by the prevalence of low-quality image or video sources, which yield poor 3D reconstructions. In this paper, we introduce SuperHead, a novel framework for enhancing low-resolution, animatable 3D head avatars. The core challenge lies in synthesizing high-quality geometry and textures, while ensuring both 3D and temporal consistency during animation and preserving subject identity. Despite recent progress in image, video and 3D-based super-resolution (SR), existing SR techniques are ill-equipped to handle dynamic 3D inputs. To address this, SuperHead leverages the rich priors from pre-trained 3D generative models via a novel dynamics-aware 3D inversion scheme. This process optimizes the latent representation of the generative model to produce a super-resolved 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) head model, which is subsequently rigged to an underlying parametric head model (e.g., FLAME) for animation. The inversion is jointly supervised using a sparse collection of upscaled 2D face renderings and corresponding depth maps, captured from diverse facial expressions and camera viewpoints, to ensure realism under dynamic facial motions. Experiments demonstrate that SuperHead generates avatars with fine-grained facial details under dynamic motions, significantly outperforming baseline methods in visual quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EgoAVU: A scalable data engine for generating egocentric audio-visual training data and benchmarks to improve multimodal LLMs' joint understanding of both visual and audio cues in egocentric videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal LLMs struggle with joint understanding of visual and audio modalities in egocentric videos due to lack of coherent joint-modality text labels, and they tend to bias heavily toward visual signals while neglecting audio cues.

Method: Introduces EgoAVU data engine that automatically generates egocentric audio-visual narrations, questions, and answers through cross-modal correlation modeling, token-based video filtering, and modular graph-based curation. Creates EgoAVU-Instruct (3M training samples) and EgoAVU-Bench (manually verified evaluation).

Result: Finetuning MLLMs on EgoAVU-Instruct enables up to 113% performance improvement on EgoAVU-Bench and transfers to other benchmarks (EgoTempo, EgoIllusion) with up to 28% relative performance gain, effectively addressing the audio-visual joint understanding problem.

Conclusion: EgoAVU provides a scalable solution for improving multimodal LLMs' joint audio-visual understanding in egocentric videos, addressing the bias toward visual signals and enabling better integration of audio cues with visual context.

Abstract: Understanding egocentric videos plays a vital role for embodied intelligence. Recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) can accept both visual and audio inputs. However, due to the challenge of obtaining text labels with coherent joint-modality information, whether MLLMs can jointly understand both modalities in egocentric videos remains under-explored. To address this problem, we introduce EgoAVU, a scalable data engine to automatically generate egocentric audio-visual narrations, questions, and answers. EgoAVU enriches human narrations with multimodal context and generates audio-visual narrations through cross-modal correlation modeling. Token-based video filtering and modular, graph-based curation ensure both data diversity and quality. Leveraging EgoAVU, we construct EgoAVU-Instruct, a large-scale training dataset of 3M samples, and EgoAVU-Bench, a manually verified evaluation split covering diverse tasks. EgoAVU-Bench clearly reveals the limitations of existing MLLMs: they bias heavily toward visual signals, often neglecting audio cues or failing to correspond audio with the visual source. Finetuning MLLMs on EgoAVU-Instruct effectively addresses this issue, enabling up to 113% performance improvement on EgoAVU-Bench. Such benefits also transfer to other benchmarks such as EgoTempo and EgoIllusion, achieving up to 28% relative performance gain. Code will be released to the community.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DwD uses DINOv3 vision foundation model features as a unified bridge between simulation and real domains for autonomous driving video generation, solving the Consistency-Realism Dilemma through feature processing, spatial alignment, and temporal aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Sim2Real methods for autonomous driving video generation face a fundamental Consistency-Realism Dilemma: low-level signals ensure precise control but compromise realism by "baking in" synthetic artifacts, while high-level priors facilitate photorealism but lack structural detail for consistent guidance.

Method: DwD leverages DINOv3 Vision Foundation Model features as a unified bridge. It uses Principal Subspace Projection to discard high-frequency "texture baking" elements, Random Channel Tail Drop to mitigate structural loss, a learnable Spatial Alignment Module to adapt high-resolution features to diffusion backbone, and a Causal Temporal Aggregator with causal convolutions to preserve historical motion context.

Result: The framework reconciles realism with control consistency, effectively mitigates motion blur, guarantees temporal stability, and enhances control precision for autonomous driving video generation.

Conclusion: DwD presents a novel approach that successfully addresses the Consistency-Realism Dilemma in Sim2Real autonomous driving video generation by leveraging VFM features with specialized processing techniques for spatial alignment and temporal consistency.

Abstract: Driven by the emergence of Controllable Video Diffusion, existing Sim2Real methods for autonomous driving video generation typically rely on explicit intermediate representations to bridge the domain gap. However, these modalities face a fundamental Consistency-Realism Dilemma. Low-level signals (e.g., edges, blurred images) ensure precise control but compromise realism by "baking in" synthetic artifacts, whereas high-level priors (e.g., depth, semantics, HDMaps) facilitate photorealism but lack the structural detail required for consistent guidance. In this work, we present Driving with DINO (DwD), a novel framework that leverages Vision Foundation Module (VFM) features as a unified bridge between the simulation and real-world domains. We first identify that these features encode a spectrum of information, from high-level semantics to fine-grained structure. To effectively utilize this, we employ Principal Subspace Projection to discard the high-frequency elements responsible for "texture baking," while concurrently introducing Random Channel Tail Drop to mitigate the structural loss inherent in rigid dimensionality reduction, thereby reconciling realism with control consistency. Furthermore, to fully leverage DINOv3's high-resolution capabilities for enhancing control precision, we introduce a learnable Spatial Alignment Module that adapts these high-resolution features to the diffusion backbone. Finally, we propose a Causal Temporal Aggregator employing causal convolutions to explicitly preserve historical motion context when integrating frame-wise DINO features, which effectively mitigates motion blur and guarantees temporal stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implicit SDF methods require large labeled datasets, limiting scalability. Need to leverage abundant unlabeled images for more practical 3D reconstruction.

Method: Proposes MetaSSP with gradient-based parameter importance estimation for adaptive EMA updates and SDF-aware pseudo-label weighting combining augmentation consistency with SDF variance. Uses 10% supervised warm-up then joint refinement of labeled/unlabeled data.

Result: On Pix3D benchmark: reduces Chamfer Distance by ~20.61% and increases IoU by ~24.09% compared to existing semi-supervised baselines, achieving new state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: MetaSSP effectively leverages unlabeled data to improve 3D reconstruction quality while reducing labeled data dependency, demonstrating strong semi-supervised learning capabilities for implicit SDF methods.

Abstract: Implicit SDF-based methods for single-view 3D reconstruction achieve high-quality surfaces but require large labeled datasets, limiting their scalability. We propose MetaSSP, a novel semi-supervised framework that exploits abundant unlabeled images. Our approach introduces gradient-based parameter importance estimation to regularize adaptive EMA updates and an SDF-aware pseudo-label weighting mechanism combining augmentation consistency with SDF variance. Beginning with a 10% supervised warm-up, the unified pipeline jointly refines labeled and unlabeled data. On the Pix3D benchmark, our method reduces Chamfer Distance by approximately 20.61% and increases IoU by around 24.09% compared to existing semi-supervised baselines, setting a new state of the art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models struggle with complex compositional prompts involving multiple constraints, despite achieving impressive fidelity in simpler text-to-image synthesis.

Method: M3 uses a multi-agent loop with specialized agents: Planner decomposes prompts into checklists, Checker identifies constraint violations, Refiner corrects constraints one at a time, Editor implements corrections, and Verifier ensures monotonic improvement.

Result: M3 achieves state-of-the-art performance on OneIG-EN benchmark (0.532), surpassing commercial systems like Imagen4 (0.515) and Seedream 3.0 (0.530), and doubles spatial reasoning performance on hardened GenEval test sets.

Conclusion: Intelligent multi-agent reasoning can elevate open-source models beyond proprietary alternatives, establishing a new paradigm for compositional generation without costly retraining.

Abstract: Generative models have achieved impressive fidelity in text-to-image synthesis, yet struggle with complex compositional prompts involving multiple constraints. We introduce \textbf{M3 (Multi-Modal, Multi-Agent, Multi-Round)}, a training-free framework that systematically resolves these failures through iterative inference-time refinement. M3 orchestrates off-the-shelf foundation models in a robust multi-agent loop: a Planner decomposes prompts into verifiable checklists, while specialized Checker, Refiner, and Editor agents surgically correct constraints one at a time, with a Verifier ensuring monotonic improvement. Applied to open-source models, M3 achieves remarkable results on the challenging OneIG-EN benchmark, with our Qwen-Image+M3 surpassing commercial flagship systems including Imagen4 (0.515) and Seedream 3.0 (0.530), reaching state-of-the-art performance (0.532 overall). This demonstrates that intelligent multi-agent reasoning can elevate open-source models beyond proprietary alternatives. M3 also substantially improves GenEval compositional metrics, effectively doubling spatial reasoning performance on hardened test sets. As a plug-and-play module compatible with any pre-trained T2I model, M3 establishes a new paradigm for compositional generation without costly retraining.

TL;DR: Unsupervised anomaly detection framework for pelvic MRI using residual variational autoencoder trained on healthy scans, achieving real-time performance and generalizable pathology detection without labeled abnormal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pelvic diseases in women are often diagnosed late due to anatomical variability complicating MRI interpretation. Existing AI approaches are disease-specific, lack real-time compatibility, and have limited generalizability, creating a need for more flexible, real-time anomaly detection.

Method: Residual variational autoencoder trained exclusively on healthy sagittal T2-weighted MRI scans from diverse protocols. Uses reconstruction error heatmaps to detect pathological regions without labeled abnormal data. Augmented with diffusion-generated synthetic data for robustness.

Result: Achieved average AUC of 0.736 on Uterine Myoma MRI Dataset with 0.828 sensitivity and 0.692 specificity. Reconstruction time of ~92.6 frames per second enables real-time compatibility. Clinical evaluation extended to endometrial cancer, endometriosis, and adenomyosis.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a benchmark for unsupervised, disease-agnostic anomaly detection in pelvic MRI, supporting future real-time clinical integration. Code and prospective datasets are available for academic collaboration.

Abstract: Pelvic diseases in women of reproductive age represent a major global health burden, with diagnosis frequently delayed due to high anatomical variability, complicating MRI interpretation. Existing AI approaches are largely disease-specific and lack real-time compatibility, limiting generalizability and clinical integration. To address these challenges, we establish a benchmark framework for disease- and parameter-agnostic, real-time-compatible unsupervised anomaly detection in pelvic MRI. The method uses a residual variational autoencoder trained exclusively on healthy sagittal T2-weighted scans acquired across diverse imaging protocols to model normal pelvic anatomy. During inference, reconstruction error heatmaps indicate deviations from learned healthy structure, enabling detection of pathological regions without labeled abnormal data. The model is trained on 294 healthy scans and augmented with diffusion-generated synthetic data to improve robustness. Quantitative evaluation on the publicly available Uterine Myoma MRI Dataset yields an average area-under-the-curve (AUC) value of 0.736, with 0.828 sensitivity and 0.692 specificity. Additional inter-observer clinical evaluation extends analysis to endometrial cancer, endometriosis, and adenomyosis, revealing the influence of anatomical heterogeneity and inter-observer variability on performance interpretation. With a reconstruction time of approximately 92.6 frames per second, the proposed framework establishes a baseline for unsupervised anomaly detection in the female pelvis and supports future integration into real-time MRI. Code is available upon request (https://github.com/AniKnu/UADPelvis), prospective data sets are available for academic collaboration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhenoLIP is a medical vision-language model that integrates structured phenotype knowledge from PhenoKG (520K image-text pairs linked to 3,000+ phenotypes) via knowledge distillation, achieving SOTA performance on phenotype recognition tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical VLMs rely on coarse image-text contrastive learning and fail to capture systematic visual knowledge encoded in medical phenotype ontologies, limiting structured medical image understanding.

Method: Two-stage pretraining: 1) Learn knowledge-enhanced phenotype embeddings from textual ontology data, 2) Distill structured knowledge into multimodal pretraining via teacher-guided knowledge distillation using PhenoKG dataset.

Result: PhenoLIP outperforms previous SOTA: improves BiomedCLIP by 8.85% in phenotype classification and BIOMEDICA by 15.03% in cross-modal retrieval on PhenoBench benchmark (7,800+ image-caption pairs covering 1,000+ phenotypes).

Conclusion: Integrating phenotype-centric priors through structured knowledge graphs significantly enhances medical VLMs for structured and interpretable medical image understanding.

Abstract: Recent progress in large-scale CLIP-like vision-language models(VLMs) has greatly advanced medical image analysis. However, most existing medical VLMs still rely on coarse image-text contrastive objectives and fail to capture the systematic visual knowledge encoded in well-defined medical phenotype ontologies. To address this gap, we construct PhenoKG, the first large-scale, phenotype-centric multimodal knowledge graph that encompasses over 520K high-quality image-text pairs linked to more than 3,000 phenotypes. Building upon PhenoKG, we propose PhenoLIP, a novel pretraining framework that explicitly incorporates structured phenotype knowledge into medical VLMs through a two-stage process. We first learn a knowledge-enhanced phenotype embedding space from textual ontology data and then distill this structured knowledge into multimodal pretraining via a teacher-guided knowledge distillation objective. To support evaluation, we further introduce PhenoBench, an expert-verified benchmark designed for phenotype recognition, comprising over 7,800 image--caption pairs covering more than 1,000 phenotypes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhenoLIP outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines, improving upon BiomedCLIP in phenotype classification accuracy by 8.85\% and BIOMEDICA in cross-modal retrieval by 15.03%, underscoring the value of integrating phenotype-centric priors into medical VLMs for structured and interpretable medical image understanding.

*Khiem Pham,Quang Nguyen,Tung Nguyen,Jingsen Zhu,Michele Santacatterina,Dimitris Metaxas,Ramin Zabih*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Debiased DPO (DeDPO) enhances DPO alignment by using synthetic AI feedback to augment limited human data, with causal debiasing to correct systematic bias in synthetic annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO's reliance on large-scale human preference labels creates cost and scalability bottlenecks. Need to leverage cheaper synthetic AI feedback while addressing its inherent biases and noise.

Method: Semi-supervised framework combining limited human data with large corpus of unlabeled pairs annotated via synthetic AI feedback. Integrates debiased estimation technique from causal inference into DPO objective to correct systematic bias in synthetic annotators.

Result: DeDPO is robust to variations in synthetic labeling methods, achieving performance matching or exceeding theoretical upper bound of models trained on fully human-labeled data.

Conclusion: DeDPO establishes a scalable solution for human-AI alignment using inexpensive synthetic supervision, overcoming DPO's cost and scalability limitations.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a predominant alignment method for diffusion models, facilitating off-policy training without explicit reward modeling. However, its reliance on large-scale, high-quality human preference labels presents a severe cost and scalability bottleneck. To overcome this, We propose a semi-supervised framework augmenting limited human data with a large corpus of unlabeled pairs annotated via cost-effective synthetic AI feedback. Our paper introduces Debiased DPO (DeDPO), which uniquely integrates a debiased estimation technique from causal inference into the DPO objective. By explicitly identifying and correcting the systematic bias and noise inherent in synthetic annotators, DeDPO ensures robust learning from imperfect feedback sources, including self-training and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Experiments demonstrate that DeDPO is robust to the variations in synthetic labeling methods, achieving performance that matches and occasionally exceeds the theoretical upper bound of models trained on fully human-labeled data. This establishes DeDPO as a scalable solution for human-AI alignment using inexpensive synthetic supervision.

Conclusion: AnyThermal provides a robust, task-agnostic thermal backbone that works across multiple environments without task-specific training, enabled by knowledge distillation from visual foundation models and a diverse thermal dataset.

Abstract: We present AnyThermal, a thermal backbone that captures robust task-agnostic thermal features suitable for a variety of tasks such as cross-modal place recognition, thermal segmentation, and monocular depth estimation using thermal images.

Unlike prior methods, AnyThermal can be used for a wide range of environments (indoor, aerial, off-road, urban) and tasks, all without task-specific training. Our key insight is to distill the feature representations from visual foundation models such as DINOv2 into a thermal encoder using thermal data from these multiple environments. To bridge the diversity gap of the existing RGB-Thermal datasets, we introduce the TartanRGBT platform, the first open-source data collection platform with synced RGB-Thermal image acquisition.

Conclusion: DroneKey++ provides an effective prior-free solution for 3D drone pose estimation with strong generalization and real-time performance, supported by a large-scale synthetic dataset that addresses current dataset limitations.

Abstract: Accurate 3D pose estimation of drones is essential for security and surveillance systems. However, existing methods often rely on prior drone information such as physical sizes or 3D meshes. At the same time, current datasets are small-scale, limited to single models, and collected under constrained environments, which makes reliable validation of generalization difficult. We present DroneKey++, a prior-free framework that jointly performs keypoint detection, drone classification, and 3D pose estimation. The framework employs a keypoint encoder for simultaneous keypoint detection and classification, and a pose decoder that estimates 3D pose using ray-based geometric reasoning and class embeddings. To address dataset limitations, we construct 6DroneSyn, a large-scale synthetic benchmark with over 50K images covering 7 drone models and 88 outdoor backgrounds, generated using 360-degree panoramic synthesis.

*Jorge Daniel Rodríguez-Vidal,Gabriel Villalonga,Diego Porres,Antonio M. López Peña*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A differentiable vehicle-model framework bridges the gap between waypoint-based and action-based autonomous driving systems by rolling out action sequences to waypoint trajectories, enabling action-based models to be trained and evaluated in waypoint-based benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current E2E-AD systems are divided into waypoint-based and action-based models, but most benchmarks and training pipelines are waypoint-based, making action-based policies harder to train and compare, slowing their progress.

Method: Proposes a differentiable vehicle-model framework that rolls out predicted action sequences (throttle, steer, brake) to their corresponding ego-frame waypoint trajectories while supervising in waypoint space.

Result: Achieves consistent improvements over baselines across multiple challenging benchmarks, with state-of-the-art performance on NAVSIM navhard benchmark.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the waypoint-action gap, enabling action-based architectures to be trained and evaluated within waypoint-based benchmarks without modifying evaluation protocols, advancing action-based autonomous driving research.

Abstract: End-to-End Autonomous Driving (E2E-AD) systems are typically grouped by the nature of their outputs: (i) waypoint-based models that predict a future trajectory, and (ii) action-based models that directly output throttle, steer and brake. Most recent benchmark protocols and training pipelines are waypoint-based, which makes action-based policies harder to train and compare, slowing their progress. To bridge this waypoint-action gap, we propose a novel, differentiable vehicle-model framework that rolls out predicted action sequences to their corresponding ego-frame waypoint trajectories while supervising in waypoint space. Our approach enables action-based architectures to be trained and evaluated, for the first time, within waypoint-based benchmarks without modifying the underlying evaluation protocol. We extensively evaluate our framework across multiple challenging benchmarks and observe consistent improvements over the baselines. In particular, on NAVSIM \texttt{navhard} our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

### [13] [Cross-Modal Redundancy and the Geometry of Vision-Language Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06218)
*Grégoire Dhimoïla,Thomas Fel,Victor Boutin,Agustin Picard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs' shared embedding space geometry is poorly understood. Using Iso-Energy Assumption and Aligned Sparse Autoencoder, researchers found bimodal atoms handle cross-modal alignment while unimodal atoms explain modality gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models align images and text successfully, but the geometry of their shared embedding space remains poorly understood, limiting interpretability and practical applications.

Method: Proposed Iso-Energy Assumption exploiting cross-modal redundancy, operationalized with Aligned Sparse Autoencoder that encourages energy consistency during training while preserving reconstruction.

Result: Aligned SAE reveals clear structure: sparse bimodal atoms carry cross-modal alignment; unimodal atoms explain modality gap; removing unimodal atoms collapses gap without harming performance; bimodal subspace enables in-distribution edits and improved retrieval.

Conclusion: Right inductive bias can preserve model fidelity while making latent geometry interpretable and actionable, with practical implications for VLM understanding and applications.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) align images and text with remarkable success, yet the geometry of their shared embedding space remains poorly understood. To probe this geometry, we begin from the Iso-Energy Assumption, which exploits cross-modal redundancy: a concept that is truly shared should exhibit the same average energy across modalities. We operationalize this assumption with an Aligned Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) that encourages energy consistency during training while preserving reconstruction. We find that this inductive bias changes the SAE solution without harming reconstruction, giving us a representation that serves as a tool for geometric analysis. Sanity checks on controlled data with known ground truth confirm that alignment improves when Iso-Energy holds and remains neutral when it does not. Applied to foundational VLMs, our framework reveals a clear structure with practical consequences: (i) sparse bimodal atoms carry the entire cross-modal alignment signal; (ii) unimodal atoms act as modality-specific biases and fully explain the modality gap; (iii) removing unimodal atoms collapses the gap without harming performance; (iv) restricting vector arithmetic to the bimodal subspace yields in-distribution edits and improved retrieval. These findings suggest that the right inductive bias can both preserve model fidelity and render the latent geometry interpretable and actionable.

Motivation: Monocular videos of hand-object interactions are abundant but reconstructing objects is challenging due to severe occlusions and complex coupled motion of camera, hands, and objects.

Method: Joint prediction of 2D mask inpainting and 3D shape completion in a feed-forward framework that exchanges information between 2D and 3D domains to handle severe hand-object occlusion.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in object reconstruction with around 100x speedup compared to previous methods, reconstructing objects within one minute of inference time.

Conclusion: ForeHOI demonstrates that joint 2D-3D shape completion effectively addresses occlusion challenges in hand-object videos, enabling fast, high-quality 3D object reconstruction without pre-processing.

Abstract: The ubiquity of monocular videos capturing daily hand-object interactions presents a valuable resource for embodied intelligence. While 3D hand reconstruction from in-the-wild videos has seen significant progress, reconstructing the involved objects remains challenging due to severe occlusions and the complex, coupled motion of the camera, hands, and object. In this paper, we introduce ForeHOI, a novel feed-forward model that directly reconstructs 3D object geometry from monocular hand-object interaction videos within one minute of inference time, eliminating the need for any pre-processing steps. Our key insight is that, the joint prediction of 2D mask inpainting and 3D shape completion in a feed-forward framework can effectively address the problem of severe occlusion in monocular hand-held object videos, thereby achieving results that outperform the performance of optimization-based methods. The information exchanges between the 2D and 3D shape completion boosts the overall reconstruction quality, enabling the framework to effectively handle severe hand-object occlusion. Furthermore, to support the training of our model, we contribute the first large-scale, high-fidelity synthetic dataset of hand-object interactions with comprehensive annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ForeHOI achieves state-of-the-art performance in object reconstruction, significantly outperforming previous methods with around a 100x speedup.

TL;DR: ASMa: Asymmetric Spatio-temporal Masking for balanced skeleton action representation learning with knowledge distillation for edge deployment


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSL methods for skeleton action recognition rely on biased augmentations that mask only high-motion frames and high-degree joints, leading to incomplete feature representations that struggle with varied motion patterns.

Method: Proposes Asymmetric Spatio-temporal Masking (ASMa) with two complementary strategies: (1) masks high-degree joints and low-motion frames, (2) masks low-degree joints and high-motion frames. Includes learnable feature alignment module and knowledge distillation for model compression.

Result: Outperforms existing SSL methods by 2.7-4.4% on NTU RGB+D 60/120 and PKU-MMD datasets, achieves up to 5.9% improvement in transfer learning to noisy datasets. Distilled model achieves 91.4% parameter reduction and 3x faster inference on edge devices while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: ASMa provides balanced and comprehensive skeleton representation learning through complementary masking strategies, enabling practical deployment in resource-constrained scenarios via knowledge distillation while outperforming existing SSL approaches.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown remarkable success in skeleton-based action recognition by leveraging data augmentations to learn meaningful representations. However, existing SSL methods rely on data augmentations that predominantly focus on masking high-motion frames and high-degree joints such as joints with degree 3 or 4. This results in biased and incomplete feature representations that struggle to generalize across varied motion patterns. To address this, we propose Asymmetric Spatio-temporal Masking (ASMa) for Skeleton Action Representation Learning, a novel combination of masking to learn a full spectrum of spatio-temporal dynamics inherent in human actions. ASMa employs two complementary masking strategies: one that selectively masks high-degree joints and low-motion, and another that masks low-degree joints and high-motion frames. These masking strategies ensure a more balanced and comprehensive skeleton representation learning. Furthermore, we introduce a learnable feature alignment module to effectively align the representations learned from both masked views. To facilitate deployment in resource-constrained settings and on low-resource devices, we compress the learned and aligned representation into a lightweight model using knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKU-MMD datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing SSL methods with an average improvement of 2.7-4.4% in fine-tuning and up to 5.9% in transfer learning to noisy datasets and achieves competitive performance compared to fully supervised baselines. Our distilled model achieves 91.4% parameter reduction and 3x faster inference on edge devices while maintaining competitive accuracy, enabling practical deployment in resource-constrained scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision transformer model uses fingerprint images to distinguish Kabuki and Wiedemann-Steiner syndromes from controls and each other with AUC scores up to 0.85, showing potential as noninvasive AI diagnostic tool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many individuals with Kabuki syndrome (KS) and Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome (WSS) remain undiagnosed due to barriers in accessing genetic testing and clinical expertise. Dermatoglyphic anomalies are established hallmarks of genetic syndromes but remain underutilized in diagnosis.

Method: Developed a vision transformer-based deep learning model that analyzes fingerprint images to perform three binary classification tasks: control vs. KS, control vs. WSS, and KS vs. WSS. Used attention-based visualizations to identify salient fingerprint regions for interpretability.

Result: Model achieved AUC scores of 0.80 (control vs. KS), 0.73 (control vs. WSS), and 0.85 (KS vs. WSS), with corresponding F1 scores of 0.71, 0.72, and 0.83. Attention visualizations identified syndrome-specific fingerprint features.

Conclusion: Fingerprint-based AI tools show promise as noninvasive, interpretable, and accessible diagnostic aids for early diagnosis of underdiagnosed genetic syndromes like KS and WSS, leveraging syndrome-specific fingerprint features.

Abstract: Kabuki syndrome (KS) and Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome (WSS) are rare but distinct developmental disorders that share overlapping clinical features, including neurodevelopmental delay, growth restriction, and persistent fetal fingertip pads. While genetic testing remains the diagnostic gold standard, many individuals with KS or WSS remain undiagnosed due to barriers in access to both genetic testing and expertise. Dermatoglyphic anomalies, despite being established hallmarks of several genetic syndromes, remain an underutilized diagnostic signal in the era of molecular testing. This study presents a vision transformer-based deep learning model that leverages fingerprint images to distinguish individuals with KS and WSS from unaffected controls and from one another. We evaluate model performance across three binary classification tasks. Across the three classification tasks, the model achieved AUC scores of 0.80 (control vs. KS), 0.73 (control vs. WSS), and 0.85 (KS vs. WSS), with corresponding F1 scores of 0.71, 0.72, and 0.83, respectively. Beyond classification, we apply attention-based visualizations to identify fingerprint regions most salient to model predictions, enhancing interpretability. Together, these findings suggest the presence of syndrome-specific fingerprint features, demonstrating the feasibility of a fingerprint-based artificial intelligence (AI) tool as a noninvasive, interpretable, and accessible future diagnostic aid for the early diagnosis of underdiagnosed genetic syndromes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMEarth-Bench is a new multimodal environmental benchmark with 5 tasks, 12 modalities, and global data distribution to evaluate geospatial ML models, showing that pretraining improves robustness but geographic generalization remains poor, with proposed TTT-MMR method enhancing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing geospatial benchmark datasets have few modalities and poor global representation, limiting evaluation of multimodal pretrained models at global scales.

Method: Introduce MMEarth-Bench with 5 multimodal environmental tasks, 12 modalities, globally distributed data, and in-/out-of-distribution test splits. Propose TTT-MMR (test-time training with multimodal reconstruction) for model adaptation using all available modalities as auxiliary tasks.

Result: Pretraining improves model robustness in limited data settings but geographic generalization remains poor. TTT-MMR improves performance on both random and geographic test splits, with geographic batching providing good trade-off between regularization and specialization.

Conclusion: MMEarth-Bench fills the gap in multimodal geospatial evaluation, revealing limitations in geographic generalization, with TTT-MMR offering effective adaptation method. Dataset, code, and visualization tool are publicly available.

Abstract: Recent research in geospatial machine learning has demonstrated that models pretrained with self-supervised learning on Earth observation data can perform well on downstream tasks with limited training data. However, most of the existing geospatial benchmark datasets have few data modalities and poor global representation, limiting the ability to evaluate multimodal pretrained models at global scales. To fill this gap, we introduce MMEarth-Bench, a collection of five new multimodal environmental tasks with 12 modalities, globally distributed data, and both in- and out-of-distribution test splits. We benchmark a diverse set of pretrained models and find that while (multimodal) pretraining tends to improve model robustness in limited data settings, geographic generalization abilities remain poor. In order to facilitate model adaptation to new downstream tasks and geographic domains, we propose a model-agnostic method for test-time training with multimodal reconstruction (TTT-MMR) that uses all the modalities available at test time as auxiliary tasks, regardless of whether a pretrained model accepts them as input. Our method improves model performance on both the random and geographic test splits, and geographic batching leads to a good trade-off between regularization and specialization during TTT. Our dataset, code, and visualization tool are linked from the project page at lgordon99.github.io/mmearth-bench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surgical navigation requires accurate registration of preoperative and intraoperative multimodal images, but faces challenges due to modality differences and intraoperative tissue deformation/displacement.

Method: Unsupervised multimodal registration using multilevel correlation pyramidal optimization: 1) Extract modality-independent features using MIN descriptor, 2) Multilevel pyramidal fusion optimization with dense correlation analysis and weight-balanced convex optimization at different scales.

Result: Achieved first place in both validation and test phases of ReMIND2Reg task in Learn2Reg 2025; validated on Resect dataset with average TRE of 1.798 mm, demonstrating broad applicability for preoperative-to-intraoperative registration.

Conclusion: MCPO effectively addresses multimodal registration challenges in surgical navigation through multilevel correlation optimization, showing strong performance and practical applicability for intraoperative guidance.

Abstract: Surgical navigation based on multimodal image registration has played a significant role in providing intraoperative guidance to surgeons by showing the relative position of the target area to critical anatomical structures during surgery. However, due to the differences between multimodal images and intraoperative image deformation caused by tissue displacement and removal during the surgery, effective registration of preoperative and intraoperative multimodal images faces significant challenges. To address the multimodal image registration challenges in Learn2Reg 2025, an unsupervised multimodal medical image registration method based on multilevel correlation pyramidal optimization (MCPO) is designed to solve these problems. First, the features of each modality are extracted based on the modality independent neighborhood descriptor, and the multimodal images is mapped to the feature space. Second, a multilevel pyramidal fusion optimization mechanism is designed to achieve global optimization and local detail complementation of the displacement field through dense correlation analysis and weight-balanced coupled convex optimization for input features at different scales. Our method focuses on the ReMIND2Reg task in Learn2Reg 2025. Based on the results, our method achieved the first place in the validation phase and test phase of ReMIND2Reg. The MCPO is also validated on the Resect dataset, achieving an average TRE of 1.798 mm. This demonstrates the broad applicability of our method in preoperative-to-intraoperative image registration.

TL;DR: Vision Transformers can now run efficiently on CNN-optimized BPU hardware by replacing linear layers with convolutional operators, enabling 3.8× speedup with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers (ViTs) like DeiT outperform CNNs but can't leverage CNN-optimized BPU hardware due to architectural mismatch - linear layers in Transformers work with 3D data while BPUs are designed for 4D convolution operations.

Method: Restructure Vision Transformers by replacing linear layers and layer normalization with carefully designed convolutional operators, allowing original weights to be inherited without retraining or fine-tuning.

Result: Quantized DeiT-Base achieves 80.4% accuracy on ImageNet (vs original 81.8%) with up to 3.8× inference speedup. Fine-tuned DeiT on flower classification shows only 0.5% accuracy drop for DeiT-Base.

Conclusion: Successfully enables Vision Transformers to fully utilize CNN-optimized BPU hardware acceleration for the first time, achieving significant speed improvements with minimal accuracy degradation.

Abstract: With the advancement of deep learning technologies, specialized neural processing hardware such as Brain Processing Units (BPUs) have emerged as dedicated platforms for CNN acceleration, offering optimized INT8 computation capabilities for convolutional operations. Meanwhile, Vision Transformer (ViT) models, such as the Data-efficient Image Transformer (DeiT), have demonstrated superior performance and play increasingly crucial roles in computer vision tasks. However, due to the architectural mismatch between CNN-optimized hardware and Vision Transformer computation characteristics--namely, that linear layers in Transformers operate on three-dimensional data while BPU acceleration is designed for four-dimensional convolution operations-it is difficult or even impossible to leverage BPU's advantages when deploying Vision Transformers. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that restructures the Vision Transformer by replacing linear layers and layer normalization operations with carefully designed convolutional operators. This enables DeiT to fully utilize the acceleration capabilities of BPUs, while allowing the original weight parameters to be inherited by the restructured models without retraining or fine-tuning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful deployment of Vision Transformers that fully leverages BPU classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Specifically, the quantized DeiT-Base model achieves 80.4% accuracy on ImageNet, compared to the original 81.8%, while obtaining up to a 3.8* inference speedup. Our finetuned DeiT model on the flower classification dataset also achieves excellent performance, with only a 0.5% accuracy drop for the DeiT-Base model, further demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ABR, an adaptive re-initialization method for continual test-time domain adaptation that preserves long-term performance by resetting model weights based on label flip changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CTTA methods focus on optimizing adaptation but don't address long-term performance degradation in continually changing environments. Need to ensure models can adapt effectively over extended periods.

Method: ABR (Adaptive-and-Balanced Re-initialization) resets model weights using adaptive intervals determined by changes in label flip patterns. Observes correlation between long-term performance and label flip trajectory.

Result: Achieves superior performance on extensive CTTA benchmarks compared to previous methods, demonstrating effectiveness in preserving long-term adaptation capability.

Conclusion: Simple yet effective re-initialization strategy based on label flip changes enables better long-term continual adaptation in non-stationary environments.

Abstract: Continual test-time domain adaptation (CTTA) aims to adjust models so that they can perform well over time across non-stationary environments. While previous methods have made considerable efforts to optimize the adaptation process, a crucial question remains: Can the model adapt to continually changing environments over a long time? In this work, we explore facilitating better CTTA in the long run using a re-initialization (or reset) based method. First, we observe that the long-term performance is associated with the trajectory pattern in label flip. Based on this observed correlation, we propose a simple yet effective policy, Adaptive-and-Balanced Re-initialization (ABR), towards preserving the model's long-term performance. In particular, ABR performs weight re-initialization using adaptive intervals. The adaptive interval is determined based on the change in label flip. The proposed method is validated on extensive CTTA benchmarks, achieving superior performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CER framework enables efficient OOD detection via hierarchical filtering with structural and semantic anomaly detection, reducing computation by 32% while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOD detection methods waste computational resources by performing full-scale inference on low-level noise, and can cause semantic hallucination where networks misinterpret physical anomalies as semantic features.

Method: Cascaded Early Rejection (CER) framework with two modules: 1) Structural Energy Sieve (SES) - non-parametric barrier using Laplacian operator to intercept physical signal anomalies at network entry; 2) Semantically-aware Hyperspherical Energy (SHE) detector - decouples feature magnitude from direction in intermediate layers to identify semantic deviations.

Result: Reduces computational overhead by 32%; achieves significant performance improvement on CIFAR-100: FPR95 decreases from 33.58% to 22.84%, AUROC improves to 93.97%; outperforms SOTA methods in real-world sensor failure scenarios.

Conclusion: CER provides an efficient, robust OOD detection framework that can be seamlessly integrated as a universal plugin into various state-of-the-art models to deliver both computational savings and performance gains.

Abstract: Efficient and robust Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is paramount for safety-critical applications.However, existing methods still execute full-scale inference on low-level statistical noise. This computational mismatch not only incurs resource waste but also induces semantic hallucination, where deep networks forcefully interpret physical anomalies as high-confidence semantic features.To address this, we propose the Cascaded Early Rejection (CER) framework, which realizes hierarchical filtering for anomaly detection via a coarse-to-fine logic.CER comprises two core modules: 1)Structural Energy Sieve (SES), which establishes a non-parametric barrier at the network entry using the Laplacian operator to efficiently intercept physical signal anomalies; and 2) the Semantically-aware Hyperspherical Energy (SHE) detector, which decouples feature magnitude from direction in intermediate layers to identify fine-grained semantic deviations. Experimental results demonstrate that CER not only reduces computational overhead by 32% but also achieves a significant performance leap on the CIFAR-100 benchmark:the average FPR95 drastically decreases from 33.58% to 22.84%, and AUROC improves to 93.97%. Crucially, in real-world scenarios simulating sensor failures, CER exhibits performance far exceeding state-of-the-art methods. As a universal plugin, CER can be seamlessly integrated into various SOTA models to provide performance gains.

TL;DR: ConceptBank is a parameter-free calibration framework that adapts SAM3 to data and concept drift in open-vocabulary segmentation by constructing dataset-specific concept banks from target statistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM3's reliance on pre-defined concept prompts makes it vulnerable to distribution shifts (data drift) and evolving label distributions (concept drift) in target domains, breaking the alignment between visual evidence and prompts.

Method: Constructs dataset-specific concept banks from target statistics using three key components: (i) anchors target-domain evidence via class-wise visual prototypes, (ii) mines representative supports to suppress outliers under data drift, and (iii) fuses candidate concepts to rectify concept drift.

Result: Effectively adapts SAM3 to distribution drifts in challenging natural-scene and remote-sensing scenarios, establishing a new baseline for robustness and efficiency in open-vocabulary segmentation.

Conclusion: ConceptBank provides a parameter-free calibration framework that restores alignment between visual evidence and prompts under distribution shifts, enhancing SAM3's robustness to data and concept drift in real-world applications.

Abstract: The recent introduction of \texttt{SAM3} has revolutionized Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) through \textit{promptable concept segmentation}, which grounds pixel predictions in flexible concept prompts. However, this reliance on pre-defined concepts makes the model vulnerable: when visual distributions shift (\textit{data drift}) or conditional label distributions evolve (\textit{concept drift}) in the target domain, the alignment between visual evidence and prompts breaks down. In this work, we present \textsc{ConceptBank}, a parameter-free calibration framework to restore this alignment on the fly. Instead of adhering to static prompts, we construct a dataset-specific concept bank from the target statistics. Our approach (\textit{i}) anchors target-domain evidence via class-wise visual prototypes, (\textit{ii}) mines representative supports to suppress outliers under data drift, and (\textit{iii}) fuses candidate concepts to rectify concept drift. We demonstrate that \textsc{ConceptBank} effectively adapts \texttt{SAM3} to distribution drifts, including challenging natural-scene and remote-sensing scenarios, establishing a new baseline for robustness and efficiency in OVS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPDA-SAM enhances SAM with self-prompting and depth-aware RGB-D fusion for improved instance segmentation without manual prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM's performance depends on manual prompt quality and lacks depth information from RGB images, limiting spatial structure perception and boundary delineation.

Method: Proposes SPDA-SAM with Semantic-Spatial Self-prompt Module (SSSPM) to extract prompts from SAM's encoder/decoder, and Coarse-to-Fine RGB-D Fusion Module (C2FFM) to fuse RGB and estimated depth features.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art counterparts across twelve different datasets, demonstrating effectiveness of self-prompts and depth-aware fusion.

Conclusion: SPDA-SAM successfully addresses SAM's prompt dependency and depth limitation through self-prompting and coarse-to-fine RGB-D fusion, achieving superior instance segmentation performance.

Abstract: Recently, Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated strong generalizability in various instance segmentation tasks. However, its performance is severely dependent on the quality of manual prompts. In addition, the RGB images that instance segmentation methods normally use inherently lack depth information. As a result, the ability of these methods to perceive spatial structures and delineate object boundaries is hindered. To address these challenges, we propose a Self-prompted Depth-Aware SAM (SPDA-SAM) for instance segmentation. Specifically, we design a Semantic-Spatial Self-prompt Module (SSSPM) which extracts the semantic and spatial prompts from the image encoder and the mask decoder of SAM, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce a Coarse-to-Fine RGB-D Fusion Module (C2FFM), in which the features extracted from a monocular RGB image and the depth map estimated from it are fused. In particular, the structural information in the depth map is used to provide coarse-grained guidance to feature fusion, while local variations in depth are encoded in order to fuse fine-grained feature representations. To our knowledge, SAM has not been explored in such self-prompted and depth-aware manners. Experimental results demonstrate that our SPDA-SAM outperforms its state-of-the-art counterparts across twelve different data sets. These promising results should be due to the guidance of the self-prompts and the compensation for the spatial information loss by the coarse-to-fine RGB-D fusion operation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for rendering dynamic humans from monocular videos degrade catastrophically under occlusions. Current solutions either use generative models that cause temporal flickering or rigid geometric heuristics that fail to capture diverse appearances.

Method: Reformulates the task as Maximum A Posteriori estimation under heteroscedastic observation noise. Proposes U-4DGS framework with Probabilistic Deformation Network and Double Rasterization pipeline that renders pixel-aligned uncertainty maps as adaptive gradient modulators. Includes Confidence-Aware Regularizations to prevent geometric drift in regions lacking reliable visual cues.

Result: Extensive experiments on ZJU-MoCap and OcMotion datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art rendering fidelity and robustness compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: U-4DGS effectively addresses occlusion challenges in dynamic human rendering by incorporating uncertainty modeling and adaptive optimization, achieving superior performance without the artifacts of previous approaches.

Abstract: High-fidelity rendering of dynamic humans from monocular videos typically degrades catastrophically under occlusions. Existing solutions incorporate external priors-either hallucinating missing content via generative models, which induces severe temporal flickering, or imposing rigid geometric heuristics that fail to capture diverse appearances. To this end, we reformulate the task as a Maximum A Posteriori estimation problem under heteroscedastic observation noise. In this paper, we propose U-4DGS, a framework integrating a Probabilistic Deformation Network and a Double Rasterization pipeline. This architecture renders pixel-aligned uncertainty maps that act as an adaptive gradient modulator, automatically attenuating artifacts from unreliable observations. Furthermore, to prevent geometric drift in regions lacking reliable visual cues, we enforce Confidence-Aware Regularizations, which leverage the learned uncertainty to selectively propagate spatial-temporal validity. Extensive experiments on ZJU-MoCap and OcMotion demonstrate that U-4DGS achieves SOTA rendering fidelity and robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowConsist improves fast flow models by addressing trajectory drift and error accumulation, achieving SOTA 1.52 FID on ImageNet 256×256 with just 1 sampling step.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fast-flow training has two fundamental issues: 1) conditional velocities from random noise-data pairs cause systematic trajectory drift, preventing consistent ODE paths, and 2) model approximation errors accumulate over time steps, leading to severe deviations in long intervals.

Method: Proposes FlowConsist with two key innovations: 1) replaces conditional velocities with marginal velocities predicted by the model itself to align optimization with true trajectories, and 2) introduces trajectory rectification strategy that aligns marginal distributions of generated and real samples at every time step.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art on ImageNet 256×256 with FID of 1.52 using only 1 sampling step, demonstrating significant improvement over previous fast flow methods.

Conclusion: FlowConsist effectively addresses trajectory consistency issues in fast flow models through principled marginal velocity optimization and trajectory rectification, enabling high-quality one-step generation with minimal error accumulation.

Abstract: Fast flow models accelerate the iterative sampling process by learning to directly predict ODE path integrals, enabling one-step or few-step generation. However, we argue that current fast-flow training paradigms suffer from two fundamental issues. First, conditional velocities constructed from randomly paired noise-data samples introduce systematic trajectory drift, preventing models from following a consistent ODE path. Second, the model's approximation errors accumulate over time steps, leading to severe deviations across long time intervals. To address these issues, we propose FlowConsist, a training framework designed to enforce trajectory consistency in fast flows. We propose a principled alternative that replaces conditional velocities with the marginal velocities predicted by the model itself, aligning optimization with the true trajectory. To further address error accumulation over time steps, we introduce a trajectory rectification strategy that aligns the marginal distributions of generated and real samples at every time step along the trajectory. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art on ImageNet 256$\times$256, achieving an FID of 1.52 with only 1 sampling step.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing preference tuning methods for text-to-image diffusion models are computationally expensive and produce training pairs that lack meaningful differences, are expensive to sample/filter, or have irrelevant pixel variations that degrade training efficiency.

Method: Di3PO constructs positive and negative pairs by isolating specific regions targeted for improvement during preference tuning while maintaining stable surrounding context in the image.

Result: The method demonstrates efficacy on the challenging task of text rendering in diffusion models, showing improvements over baseline methods of SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) and DPO (Direct Preference Optimization).

Conclusion: Di3PO provides a more efficient and effective approach to preference tuning for text-to-image diffusion models by addressing limitations of existing methods through targeted region isolation while preserving contextual stability.

Abstract: Existing methods for preference tuning of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models often rely on computationally expensive generation steps to create positive and negative pairs of images. These approaches frequently yield training pairs that either lack meaningful differences, are expensive to sample and filter, or exhibit significant variance in irrelevant pixel regions, thereby degrading training efficiency. To address these limitations, we introduce "Di3PO", a novel method for constructing positive and negative pairs that isolates specific regions targeted for improvement during preference tuning, while keeping the surrounding context in the image stable. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by applying it to the challenging task of text rendering in diffusion models, showcasing improvements over baseline methods of SFT and DPO.

TL;DR: AUNet addresses cross-modal pedestrian detection with uncertain modality availability by introducing UMVR for modality validation and MAI for adaptive fusion, using a new TRNT dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CMPD methods fail with unpredictable modality combinations in real-world scenarios, causing performance degradation when RGB, NIR, or TIR modalities are missing.

Method: Propose Adaptive Uncertainty-aware Network (AUNet) with Unified Modality Validation Refinement (UMVR) for modal availability validation and semantic refinement, plus Modality-Aware Interaction (MAI) for adaptive information fusion.

Result: Created new TRNT dataset with 8,281 pixel-aligned RGB-NIR-TIR triplets; AUNet effectively handles arbitrary modality combinations and reduces missed detections.

Conclusion: AUNet provides robust pedestrian detection under uncertain modality availability by adaptively validating and fusing available information from RGB, NIR, and TIR modalities.

Abstract: Existing cross-modal pedestrian detection (CMPD) employs complementary information from RGB and thermal-infrared (TIR) modalities to detect pedestrians in 24h-surveillance systems.RGB captures rich pedestrian details under daylight, while TIR excels at night. However, TIR focuses primarily on the person's silhouette, neglecting critical texture details essential for detection. While the near-infrared (NIR) captures texture under low-light conditions, which effectively alleviates performance issues of RGB and detail loss in TIR, thereby reducing missed detections. To this end, we construct a new Triplet RGB-NIR-TIR (TRNT) dataset, comprising 8,281 pixel-aligned image triplets, establishing a comprehensive foundation for algorithmic research. However, due to the variable nature of real-world scenarios, imaging devices may not always capture all three modalities simultaneously. This results in input data with unpredictable combinations of modal types, which challenge existing CMPD methods that fail to extract robust pedestrian information under arbitrary input combinations, leading to significant performance degradation. To address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Uncertainty-aware Network (AUNet) for accurately discriminating modal availability and fully utilizing the available information under uncertain inputs. Specifically, we introduce Unified Modality Validation Refinement (UMVR), which includes an uncertainty-aware router to validate modal availability and a semantic refinement to ensure the reliability of information within the modality. Furthermore, we design a Modality-Aware Interaction (MAI) module to adaptively activate or deactivate its internal interaction mechanisms per UMVR output, enabling effective complementary information fusion from available modalities.

TL;DR: Proposes Observer-Centric Salient Object Detection (OC-SOD) to address the subjective nature of saliency by incorporating observer-specific factors like preferences/intents, creating a dataset and agentic baseline model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing salient object detection methods treat it as an objective prediction task with single groundtruth, but saliency is inherently subjective - different observers perceive different objects as salient based on their priors, preferences, and intents.

Method: 1) Proposes OC-SOD formulation considering both visual cues and observer-specific factors; 2) Uses multi-modal LLMs to create OC-SODBench dataset (33k images, 152k textual prompts); 3) Designs OC-SODAgent baseline using "Perceive-Reflect-Adjust" process.

Result: Created first OC-SOD dataset (OC-SODBench) and developed OC-SODAgent baseline. Extensive experiments on the proposed benchmark justify the effectiveness of the observer-centric approach.

Conclusion: Observer-centric perspective bridges gap between human perception and computational modeling, offering more realistic and flexible understanding of saliency that captures intrinsic ambiguity and diversity of human perception.

Abstract: Salient object detection is inherently a subjective problem, as observers with different priors may perceive different objects as salient. However, existing methods predominantly formulate it as an objective prediction task with a single groundtruth segmentation map for each image, which renders the problem under-determined and fundamentally ill-posed. To address this issue, we propose Observer-Centric Salient Object Detection (OC-SOD), where salient regions are predicted by considering not only the visual cues but also the observer-specific factors such as their preferences or intents. As a result, this formulation captures the intrinsic ambiguity and diversity of human perception, enabling personalized and context-aware saliency prediction. By leveraging multi-modal large language models, we develop an efficient data annotation pipeline and construct the first OC-SOD dataset named OC-SODBench, comprising 33k training, validation and test images with 152k textual prompts and object pairs. Built upon this new dataset, we further design OC-SODAgent, an agentic baseline which performs OC-SOD via a human-like "Perceive-Reflect-Adjust" process. Extensive experiments on our proposed OC-SODBench have justified the effectiveness of our contribution. Through this observer-centric perspective, we aim to bridge the gap between human perception and computational modeling, offering a more realistic and flexible understanding of what makes an object truly "salient."

TL;DR: EUGens are efficient dense layers that generalize standard fully-connected layers using random features and input norm dependence, reducing quadratic to linear complexity while maintaining expressive power.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fully-connected feedforward layers create computation and parameter bottlenecks in neural networks, limiting scalability for real-time applications and resource-constrained environments.

Method: Propose EUGens (Efficient, Unified and General dense layers) that use random features to approximate standard FFLs with input norm dependence, unify existing efficient FFL extensions, and enable layer-wise knowledge transfer without backpropagation.

Result: EUGens achieve up to 27% faster inference speed and 30% better memory efficiency when integrated into Transformers and MLPs across image classification, language model pre-training, and 3D scene reconstruction tasks.

Conclusion: EUGens offer a scalable solution for deploying large-scale neural networks in real-world scenarios by significantly improving efficiency while preserving model performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Efficient neural networks are essential for scaling machine learning models to real-time applications and resource-constrained environments. Fully-connected feedforward layers (FFLs) introduce computation and parameter count bottlenecks within neural network architectures. To address this challenge, in this work, we propose a new class of dense layers that generalize standard fully-connected feedforward layers, \textbf{E}fficient, \textbf{U}nified and \textbf{Gen}eral dense layers (EUGens). EUGens leverage random features to approximate standard FFLs and go beyond them by incorporating a direct dependence on the input norms in their computations. The proposed layers unify existing efficient FFL extensions and improve efficiency by reducing inference complexity from quadratic to linear time. They also lead to \textbf{the first} unbiased algorithms approximating FFLs with arbitrary polynomial activation functions. Furthermore, EuGens reduce the parameter count and computational overhead while preserving the expressive power and adaptability of FFLs. We also present a layer-wise knowledge transfer technique that bypasses backpropagation, enabling efficient adaptation of EUGens to pre-trained models. Empirically, we observe that integrating EUGens into Transformers and MLPs yields substantial improvements in inference speed (up to \textbf{27}\%) and memory efficiency (up to \textbf{30}\%) across a range of tasks, including image classification, language model pre-training, and 3D scene reconstruction. Overall, our results highlight the potential of EUGens for the scalable deployment of large-scale neural networks in real-world scenarios.

Motivation: GUI agents can automate complex digital tasks, but require precise GUI grounding as a foundational capability. Unlike prior work that fine-tunes models with existing spatial awareness, this research aims to master the full technical pipeline starting from a base model with minimal grounding ability.

Method: Three key approaches: (1) Refined data engineering with unified open-source datasets, augmentation, filtering, and difficulty grading; (2) Improved training strategies including continuous fine-tuning of vision encoder and maintaining resolution consistency; (3) Reinforcement Learning with verifiable rewards to improve precision in perception-intensive GUI grounding.

Conclusion: The model successfully masters GUI grounding from minimal base capabilities through comprehensive technical pipeline improvements, demonstrating that RL with verifiable rewards can significantly improve precision in perception-intensive tasks, with GUI grounding providing natural advantages for RL due to easily verifiable rewards.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of vision-language models has catalyzed the emergence of GUI agents, which hold immense potential for automating complex tasks, from online shopping to flight booking, thereby alleviating the burden of repetitive digital workflows. As a foundational capability, GUI grounding is typically established as a prerequisite for end-to-end task execution. It enables models to precisely locate interface elements, such as text and icons, to perform accurate operations like clicking and typing. Unlike prior works that fine-tune models already possessing strong spatial awareness (e.g., Qwen3-VL), we aim to master the full technical pipeline by starting from a base model with minimal grounding ability, such as POINTS-1.5. We introduce POINTS-GUI-G-8B, which achieves state-of-the-art performance with scores of 59.9 on ScreenSpot-Pro, 66.0 on OSWorld-G, 95.7 on ScreenSpot-v2, and 49.9 on UI-Vision. Our model's success is driven by three key factors: (1) Refined Data Engineering, involving the unification of diverse open-source datasets format alongside sophisticated strategies for augmentation, filtering, and difficulty grading; (2) Improved Training Strategies, including continuous fine-tuning of the vision encoder to enhance perceptual accuracy and maintaining resolution consistency between training and inference; and (3) Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Verifiable Rewards. While RL is traditionally used to bolster reasoning, we demonstrate that it significantly improves precision in the perception-intensive GUI grounding task. Furthermore, GUI grounding provides a natural advantage for RL, as rewards are easily verifiable and highly accurate.

Conclusion: TFusionOcc effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by using more flexible geometric primitives and robust statistical modeling, enabling better capture of fine-grained 3D details for improved autonomous vehicle perception.

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction enables autonomous vehicles (AVs) to perceive fine-grained geometric and semantic structure of their surroundings from onboard sensors, which is essential for safe decision-making and navigation. Recent models for 3D semantic occupancy prediction have successfully addressed the challenge of describing real-world objects with varied shapes and classes. However, the intermediate representations used by existing methods for 3D semantic occupancy prediction rely heavily on 3D voxel volumes or a set of 3D Gaussians, hindering the model's ability to efficiently and effectively capture fine-grained geometric details in the 3D driving environment. This paper introduces TFusionOcc, a novel object-centric multi-sensor fusion framework for predicting 3D semantic occupancy. By leveraging multi-stage multi-sensor fusion, Student's t-distribution, and the T-Mixture model (TMM), together with more geometrically flexible primitives, such as the deformable superquadric (superquadric with inverse warp), the proposed method achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the nuScenes benchmark. In addition, extensive experiments were conducted on the nuScenes-C dataset to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method in different camera and lidar corruption scenarios.

Abstract: Insect vision supports complex behaviors including associative learning, navigation, and object detection, and has long motivated computational models for understanding biological visual processing. However, many contemporary models prioritize task performance while neglecting biologically grounded processing pathways. Here, we introduce a bio-inspired vision model that captures principles of the insect visual system to transform dense visual input into sparse, discriminative codes. The model is trained using a fully self-supervised contrastive objective, enabling representation learning without labeled data and supporting reuse across tasks without reliance on domain-specific classifiers. We evaluated the resulting representations on flower recognition tasks and natural image benchmarks. The model consistently produced reliable sparse codes that distinguish visually similar inputs. To support different modelling and deployment uses, we have implemented the model as both an artificial neural network and a spiking neural network. In a simulated localization setting, our approach outperformed a simple image downsampling comparison baseline, highlighting the functional benefit of incorporating neuromorphic visual processing pathways. Collectively, these results advance insect computational modelling by providing a generalizable bio-inspired vision model capable of sparse computation across diverse tasks.

TL;DR: PointViT: Transformer-based 3D object detection that fuses raw LiDAR points with selectively sampled virtual points from depth-completed RGB images to improve far-field object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR-based 3D object detectors struggle with far-field objects due to sparse point clouds at long ranges, limiting geometric cues. Existing approaches that add all virtual points from RGB depth completion increase computational cost and create fusion challenges.

Method: PointViT uses a transformer-based framework that jointly processes raw LiDAR points and selectively sampled virtual points. It explores multiple fusion strategies (early point-level to BEV-based gated fusion), voxelizes the fused point cloud, encodes with sparse convolutions to create BEV representation, then initializes and refines object queries through transformer-based context aggregation.

Result: Achieves 91.16% 3D AP, 95.94% BEV AP, and 99.36% AP on KITTI 2D detection benchmark for Car class, demonstrating strong performance on the KITTI benchmark.

Conclusion: PointViT effectively addresses far-field object detection challenges by selectively fusing virtual points with raw LiDAR data through transformer-based processing, achieving state-of-the-art results while managing computational efficiency.

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D object detectors often struggle to detect far-field objects due to the sparsity of point clouds at long ranges, which limits the availability of reliable geometric cues. To address this, prior approaches augment LiDAR data with depth-completed virtual points derived from RGB images; however, directly incorporating all virtual points leads to increased computational cost and introduces challenges in effectively fusing real and virtual information. We present Point Virtual Transformer (PointViT), a transformer-based 3D object detection framework that jointly reasons over raw LiDAR points and selectively sampled virtual points. The framework examines multiple fusion strategies, ranging from early point-level fusion to BEV-based gated fusion, and analyses their trade-offs in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The fused point cloud is voxelized and encoded using sparse convolutions to form a BEV representation, from which a compact set of high-confidence object queries is initialised and refined through a transformer-based context aggregation module. Experiments on the KITTI benchmark report 91.16% 3D AP, 95.94% BEV AP, and 99.36% AP on the KITTI 2D detection benchmark for the Car class.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D saliency methods fail to explain why humans fixate on semantically meaningful but geometrically unremarkable regions, lacking semantic awareness in their approaches.

Method: Dual-stream architecture with asymmetric cross-modal fusion, using diffusion-based semantic priors from geometry-conditioned multi-view rendering and point cloud transformers for geometric processing, with cross-attention enabling geometric features to query semantic content.

Result: Substantial improvements on SAL3D, NUS3D and 3DVA datasets, demonstrating effective modeling of human visual attention on 3D surfaces.

Conclusion: Cognitively motivated architectures that formalize the dichotomy between bottom-up geometric processing and top-down semantic recognition effectively model human visual attention on three-dimensional surfaces.

Abstract: Human visual attention on three-dimensional objects emerges from the interplay between bottom-up geometric processing and top-down semantic recognition. Existing 3D saliency methods rely on hand-crafted geometric features or learning-based approaches that lack semantic awareness, failing to explain why humans fixate on semantically meaningful but geometrically unremarkable regions. We introduce SemGeo-AttentionNet, a dual-stream architecture that explicitly formalizes this dichotomy through asymmetric cross-modal fusion, leveraging diffusion-based semantic priors from geometry-conditioned multi-view rendering and point cloud transformers for geometric processing. Cross-attention ensures geometric features query semantic content, enabling bottom-up distinctiveness to guide top-down retrieval. We extend our framework to temporal scanpath generation through reinforcement learning, introducing the first formulation respecting 3D mesh topology with inhibition-of-return dynamics. Evaluation on SAL3D, NUS3D and 3DVA datasets demonstrates substantial improvements, validating how cognitively motivated architectures effectively model human visual attention on three-dimensional surfaces.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TP-GRPO improves GRPO for text-to-image generation by addressing step-wise reward sparsity and modeling long-term effects in denoising trajectories through incremental rewards and turning point detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GRPO approaches propagate outcome-based rewards uniformly across denoising steps without distinguishing local effects, and group-wise ranking ignores within-trajectory dependencies where early actions can have delayed impacts on later states.

Method: TP-GRPO introduces two innovations: (1) step-level incremental rewards instead of outcome-based rewards to provide dense, step-aware learning signals, and (2) identification of "turning points" - steps that flip local reward trends - which receive aggregated long-term rewards to capture delayed impact. Turning points are detected via sign changes in incremental rewards.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that TP-GRPO exploits reward signals more effectively and consistently improves generation quality. The method is efficient and hyperparameter-free due to its simple turning point detection mechanism.

Conclusion: TP-GRPO successfully addresses reward sparsity and long-term effect modeling in GRPO for text-to-image generation, providing a more effective framework that better isolates individual denoising actions' effects while capturing their delayed impacts through turning point detection.

Abstract: Deploying GRPO on Flow Matching models has proven effective for text-to-image generation. However, existing paradigms typically propagate an outcome-based reward to all preceding denoising steps without distinguishing the local effect of each step. Moreover, current group-wise ranking mainly compares trajectories at matched timesteps and ignores within-trajectory dependencies, where certain early denoising actions can affect later states via delayed, implicit interactions. We propose TurningPoint-GRPO (TP-GRPO), a GRPO framework that alleviates step-wise reward sparsity and explicitly models long-term effects within the denoising trajectory. TP-GRPO makes two key innovations: (i) it replaces outcome-based rewards with step-level incremental rewards, providing a dense, step-aware learning signal that better isolates each denoising action's "pure" effect, and (ii) it identifies turning points-steps that flip the local reward trend and make subsequent reward evolution consistent with the overall trajectory trend-and assigns these actions an aggregated long-term reward to capture their delayed impact. Turning points are detected solely via sign changes in incremental rewards, making TP-GRPO efficient and hyperparameter-free. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that TP-GRPO exploits reward signals more effectively and consistently improves generation. Demo code is available at https://github.com/YunzeTong/TurningPoint-GRPO.

TL;DR: POPL-KF is a Kalman filter-based VIO system that uses pose-only geometric representation for both point and line features to reduce linearization errors and enable immediate visual measurement updates, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in challenging scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional VIO systems using point features degrade in challenging scenarios, and MSCKF-based VIO suffers from linearization errors related to feature 3D coordinates and delayed measurement updates. There's a need to improve VIO performance in difficult environments.

Method: 1) Propose pose-only geometric representation for line features; 2) Develop POPL-KF using pose-only representation for both point and line features; 3) Design unified base-frames selection algorithm for optimal constraints; 4) Create line feature filter using image grid segmentation and bidirectional optical flow consistency.

Result: POPL-KF outperforms state-of-the-art filter-based methods (OpenVINS, PO-KF) and optimization-based methods (PL-VINS, EPLF-VINS) on public datasets and real-world experiments while maintaining real-time performance.

Conclusion: The pose-only geometric representation for both point and line features effectively mitigates linearization errors, enables immediate measurement updates, and improves VIO performance in challenging scenarios, making POPL-KF a superior solution for robust visual-inertial odometry.

Abstract: Mainstream Visual-inertial odometry 
(VIO) systems rely on point features for motion estimation and localization. However, their performance degrades in challenging scenarios. Moreover, the localization accuracy of multi-state constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF)-based VIO systems suffers from linearization errors associated with feature 3D coordinates and delayed measurement updates. To improve the performance of VIO in challenging scenes, we first propose a pose-only geometric representation for line features. Building on this, we develop POPL-KF, a Kalman filter-based VIO system that employs a pose-only geometric representation for both point and line features. POPL-KF mitigates linearization errors by explicitly eliminating both point and line feature coordinates from the measurement equations, while enabling immediate update of visual measurements. We also design a unified base-frames selection algorithm for both point and line features to ensure optimal constraints on camera poses within the pose-only measurement model. To further improve line feature quality, a line feature filter based on image grid segmentation and bidirectional optical flow consistency is proposed. Our system is evaluated on public datasets and real-world experiments, demonstrating that POPL-KF outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) filter-based methods (OpenVINS, PO-KF) and optimization-based methods (PL-VINS, EPLF-VINS), while maintaining real-time performance.

TL;DR: A new embodied navigation task called "out-to-in prior-free instruction-driven embodied navigation" that eliminates reliance on external priors like precise coordinates, requiring agents to navigate from outdoors to specific building entrances using only egocentric vision and instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current embodied navigation methods are limited to either indoor or outdoor environments and rely on strong assumptions like precise coordinate systems. While outdoor methods can get agents near targets, they fail at fine-grained entry through specific building entrances, limiting practical deployment for real-world applications like last-mile delivery that require seamless outdoor-to-indoor transitions.

Method: Proposes a vision-centric embodied navigation framework that uses image-based prompts to drive decision-making. Also introduces the first open-source dataset for this task, featuring a pipeline that integrates trajectory-conditioned video synthesis into the data generation process.

Result: The proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across key metrics including success rate and path efficiency, demonstrating superior performance in the out-to-in prior-free instruction-driven navigation task.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a novel embodied navigation task that bridges the gap between outdoor and indoor navigation without relying on external priors, enabling practical applications like last-mile delivery through a vision-centric framework and new dataset.

Abstract: Embodied navigation holds significant promise for real-world applications such as last-mile delivery. However, most existing approaches are confined to either indoor or outdoor environments and rely heavily on strong assumptions, such as access to precise coordinate systems. While current outdoor methods can guide agents to the vicinity of a target using coarse-grained localization, they fail to enable fine-grained entry through specific building entrances, critically limiting their utility in practical deployment scenarios that require seamless outdoor-to-indoor transitions. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task: out-to-in prior-free instruction-driven embodied navigation. This formulation explicitly eliminates reliance on accurate external priors, requiring agents to navigate solely based on egocentric visual observations guided by instructions. To tackle this task, we propose a vision-centric embodied navigation framework that leverages image-based prompts to drive decision-making. Additionally, we present the first open-source dataset for this task, featuring a pipeline that integrates trajectory-conditioned video synthesis into the data generation process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across key metrics including success rate and path efficiency.

TL;DR: ChatUMM is a conversational unified multimodal model that enables continuous dialogue with interleaved text-image generation, overcoming the single-turn limitations of current UMMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unified multimodal models are constrained by single-turn interaction paradigms, functioning as solvers for independent requests rather than continuous dialogue assistants. There's a need to bridge this gap and enable fluid, context-aware multimodal conversations.

Method: Two key innovations: 1) Interleaved multi-turn training strategy that models serialized text-image streams as continuous conversational flow, and 2) Systematic conversational data synthesis pipeline that transforms single-turn datasets into fluid dialogues through three stages: basic stateful dialogues, long-range dependency resolution with "distractor" turns, and naturally interleaved multimodal responses.

Result: ChatUMM achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source unified models on visual understanding and instruction-guided editing benchmarks, maintains competitive fidelity in text-to-image generation, and exhibits superior robustness in complex multi-turn scenarios with fluid, context-aware dialogues.

Conclusion: ChatUMM successfully bridges the gap between single-turn multimodal models and continuous dialogue assistants, demonstrating that unified multimodal models can effectively support complex, multi-turn conversational interactions with interleaved text and image generation.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) have achieved remarkable progress yet remain constrained by a single-turn interaction paradigm, effectively functioning as solvers for independent requests rather than assistants in continuous dialogue. To bridge this gap, we present ChatUMM. As a conversational unified model, it excels at robust context tracking to sustain interleaved multimodal generation. ChatUMM derives its capabilities from two key innovations: an interleaved multi-turn training strategy that models serialized text-image streams as a continuous conversational flow, and a systematic conversational data synthesis pipeline. This pipeline transforms a diverse set of standard single-turn datasets into fluid dialogues through three progressive stages: constructing basic stateful dialogues, enforcing long-range dependency resolution via ``distractor'' turns with history-dependent query rewriting, and synthesizing naturally interleaved multimodal responses. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ChatUMM achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source unified models on visual understanding and instruction-guided editing benchmarks, while maintaining competitive fidelity in text-to-image generation. Notably, ChatUMM exhibits superior robustness in complex multi-turn scenarios, ensuring fluid, context-aware dialogues.

Motivation: Existing E2E autonomous driving methods fail to effectively unify future scene evolution and action planning within a single architecture due to inadequate sharing of latent states, limiting the impact of visual imagination on action decisions.

Method: Proposes DriveWorld-VLA framework that tightly integrates Vision-Language-Action (VLA) and world models at representation level, conducts world modeling entirely in latent space, uses latent states as core decision-making states, and supports controllable action-conditioned imagination at feature level.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 91.3 PDMS on NAVSIMv1, 86.8 EPDMS on NAVSIMv2, and 0.16 3-second average collision rate on nuScenes through extensive open-loop and closed-loop evaluations.

Conclusion: DriveWorld-VLA effectively unifies world modeling and planning within latent space, enabling VLA planners to benefit from holistic scene-evolution modeling while reducing reliance on dense annotated supervision, with code and models to be released.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving has recently attracted increasing interest in unifying Vision-Language-Action (VLA) with World Models to enhance decision-making and forward-looking imagination. However, existing methods fail to effectively unify future scene evolution and action planning within a single architecture due to inadequate sharing of latent states, limiting the impact of visual imagination on action decisions. To address this limitation, we propose DriveWorld-VLA, a novel framework that unifies world modeling and planning within a latent space by tightly integrating VLA and world models at the representation level, which enables the VLA planner to benefit directly from holistic scene-evolution modeling and reducing reliance on dense annotated supervision. Additionally, DriveWorld-VLA incorporates the latent states of the world model as core decision-making states for the VLA planner, facilitating the planner to assess how candidate actions impact future scene evolution. By conducting world modeling entirely in the latent space, DriveWorld-VLA supports controllable, action-conditioned imagination at the feature level, avoiding expensive pixel-level rollouts. Extensive open-loop and closed-loop evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of DriveWorld-VLA, which achieves state-of-the-art performance with 91.3 PDMS on NAVSIMv1, 86.8 EPDMS on NAVSIMv2, and 0.16 3-second average collision rate on nuScenes. Code and models will be released in https://github.com/liulin815/DriveWorld-VLA.git.

*Xingsong Ye,Yongkun Du,JiaXin Zhang,Chen Li,Jing LYU,Zhineng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UnionST addresses the domain gap between synthetic and real text data by creating more realistic synthetic datasets with improved diversity in corpus, font, and layout, plus a self-evolution learning framework for efficient real data annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real text data collection is expensive and hard to scale, while existing synthetic data has insufficient diversity (corpus, font, layout) and lags behind real data performance due to domain gaps.

Method: Developed UnionST data engine synthesizing text covering challenging scenarios, created UnionST-S large-scale synthetic dataset, and introduced self-evolution learning (SEL) framework for efficient real data annotation.

Result: Models trained on UnionST-S outperform existing synthetic datasets, even surpassing real-data performance in some scenarios. With SEL, models achieve competitive performance using only 9% of real data labels.

Conclusion: UnionST effectively bridges the synthetic-real domain gap through improved synthetic data generation and efficient annotation methods, enabling high-performance STR models with minimal real data requirements.

Abstract: Large-scale and categorical-balanced text data is essential for training effective Scene Text Recognition (STR) models, which is hard to achieve when collecting real data. Synthetic data offers a cost-effective and perfectly labeled alternative. However, its performance often lags behind, revealing a significant domain gap between real and current synthetic data. In this work, we systematically analyze mainstream rendering-based synthetic datasets and identify their key limitations: insufficient diversity in corpus, font, and layout, which restricts their realism in complex scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce UnionST, a strong data engine synthesizes text covering a union of challenging samples and better aligns with the complexity observed in the wild. We then construct UnionST-S, a large-scale synthetic dataset with improved simulations in challenging scenarios. Furthermore, we develop a self-evolution learning (SEL) framework for effective real data annotation. Experiments show that models trained on UnionST-S achieve significant improvements over existing synthetic datasets. They even surpass real-data performance in certain scenarios. Moreover, when using SEL, the trained models achieve competitive performance by only seeing 9% of real data labels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA benchmarks provide limited or misleading assessments due to insufficient evaluation protocols that fail to capture real-world distribution shifts, making reliable benchmarking critical for advancing VLA models.

Result: Experiments with representative VLA models reveal significant performance drops under cumulative perturbations, exposing persistent limitations in scene comprehension and instruction grounding.

Conclusion: LIBERO-X offers a more reliable foundation for assessing and advancing VLA development by integrating hierarchical evaluation with diverse training data to address distribution gaps and enable fine-grained performance analysis.

Abstract: Reliable benchmarking is critical for advancing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, as it reveals their generalization, robustness, and alignment of perception with language-driven manipulation tasks. However, existing benchmarks often provide limited or misleading assessments due to insufficient evaluation protocols that inadequately capture real-world distribution shifts. This work systematically rethinks VLA benchmarking from both evaluation and data perspectives, introducing LIBERO-X, a benchmark featuring: 1) A hierarchical evaluation protocol with progressive difficulty levels targeting three core capabilities: spatial generalization, object recognition, and task instruction understanding. This design enables fine-grained analysis of performance degradation under increasing environmental and task complexity; 2) A high-diversity training dataset collected via human teleoperation, where each scene supports multiple fine-grained manipulation objectives to bridge the train-evaluation distribution gap. Experiments with representative VLA models reveal significant performance drops under cumulative perturbations, exposing persistent limitations in scene comprehension and instruction grounding. By integrating hierarchical evaluation with diverse training data, LIBERO-X offers a more reliable foundation for assessing and advancing VLA development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous transformer-based NVS methods like LVSM suffer from quadratic complexity with input views and rigid parameter sharing among heterogeneous tokens, making them inefficient and suboptimal.

Method: Proposes Efficient-LVSM with dual-stream architecture using decoupled co-refinement: intra-view self-attention for input views and self-then-cross attention for target views, eliminating unnecessary computation.

Result: Achieves 29.86 dB PSNR on RealEstate10K (2 input views), surpassing LVSM by 0.2 dB, with 2x faster training convergence, 4.4x faster inference speed, and state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Efficient-LVSM's decoupled design enables superior performance, faster computation, strong zero-shot generalization to unseen view counts, and incremental inference with KV-cache.

Abstract: Feedforward models for novel view synthesis (NVS) have recently advanced by transformer-based methods like LVSM, using attention among all input and target views. In this work, we argue that its full self-attention design is suboptimal, suffering from quadratic complexity with respect to the number of input views and rigid parameter sharing among heterogeneous tokens. We propose Efficient-LVSM, a dual-stream architecture that avoids these issues with a decoupled co-refinement mechanism. It applies intra-view self-attention for input views and self-then-cross attention for target views, eliminating unnecessary computation. Efficient-LVSM achieves 29.86 dB PSNR on RealEstate10K with 2 input views, surpassing LVSM by 0.2 dB, with 2x faster training convergence and 4.4x faster inference speed. Efficient-LVSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to unseen view counts, and enables incremental inference with KV-cache, thanks to its decoupled designs.

### [44] [Exploring Specular Reflection Inconsistency for Generalizable Face Forgery Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06452)
*Hongyan Fei,Zexi Jia,Chuanwei Huang,Jinchao Zhang,Jie Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel deepfake detection method that exploits the difficulty of replicating complex facial illumination patterns, specifically specular reflections, using a two-stage cross-attention network to detect inconsistencies in synthetic faces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detection methods struggle with high-quality, AI-generated forgeries from diffusion models. The authors observe that complex facial attributes governed by physical laws (like illumination) are inherently difficult to replicate accurately in synthetic faces.

Method: Proposes SRI-Net (Specular-Reflection-Inconsistency-Network) that: 1) Uses Retinex theory for fast face texture estimation and specular reflection separation, 2) Employs a two-stage cross-attention mechanism to capture correlations between specular reflection, face texture, and direct light, and 3) Integrates these features for robust forgery detection.

Result: The method achieves superior performance on both traditional deepfake datasets and generative deepfake datasets, particularly excelling on diffusion-generated forgery faces where existing methods show limited efficacy.

Conclusion: Focusing on physically complex facial attributes like specular reflection provides an effective approach for detecting high-quality AI-generated forgeries, with the proposed SRI-Net demonstrating strong performance against challenging diffusion-model-based deepfakes.

Abstract: Detecting deepfakes has become increasingly challenging as forgery faces synthesized by AI-generated methods, particularly diffusion models, achieve unprecedented quality and resolution. Existing forgery detection approaches relying on spatial and frequency features demonstrate limited efficacy against high-quality, entirely synthesized forgeries. In this paper, we propose a novel detection method grounded in the observation that facial attributes governed by complex physical laws and multiple parameters are inherently difficult to replicate. Specifically, we focus on illumination, particularly the specular reflection component in the Phong illumination model, which poses the greatest replication challenge due to its parametric complexity and nonlinear formulation. We introduce a fast and accurate face texture estimation method based on Retinex theory to enable precise specular reflection separation. Furthermore, drawing from the mathematical formulation of specular reflection, we posit that forgery evidence manifests not only in the specular reflection itself but also in its relationship with corresponding face texture and direct light. To address this issue, we design the Specular-Reflection-Inconsistency-Network (SRI-Net), incorporating a two-stage cross-attention mechanism to capture these correlations and integrate specular reflection related features with image features for robust forgery detection. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on both traditional deepfake datasets and generative deepfake datasets, particularly those containing diffusion-generated forgery faces.

*Xu Zhang,Zhe Chen,Jing Zhang,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LAB-Det enables frozen object detectors to adapt to specialized domains using only one exemplar per class without training, by projecting exemplars into descriptive text that conditions the detector.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation object detectors degrade in specialized, data-scarce domains like underwater imagery or industrial defects. Fine-tuning approaches are costly and risk overfitting, so the authors explore whether frozen detectors can adapt with just one exemplar per class without any training.

Method: LAB-Det (Language As a domain-invariant Bridge) projects each exemplar into descriptive text that conditions and guides a frozen detector, replacing gradient-based adaptation with linguistic conditioning for robust generalization.

Result: On UODD (underwater) and NEU-DET (industrial defects) benchmarks, LAB-Det achieves up to 5.4 mAP improvement over state-of-the-art fine-tuned baselines without updating any parameters.

Conclusion: Linguistic adaptation serves as an efficient and interpretable alternative to fine-tuning in specialized detection settings, enabling robust performance in data-scarce domains without parameter updates.

Abstract: Foundation object detectors such as GLIP and Grounding DINO excel on general-domain data but often degrade in specialized and data-scarce settings like underwater imagery or industrial defects. Typical cross-domain few-shot approaches rely on fine-tuning scarce target data, incurring cost and overfitting risks. We instead ask: Can a frozen detector adapt with only one exemplar per class without training? To answer this, we introduce training-free one-shot domain generalization for object detection, where detectors must adapt to specialized domains with only one annotated exemplar per class and no weight updates. To tackle this task, we propose LAB-Det, which exploits Language As a domain-invariant Bridge. Instead of adapting visual features, we project each exemplar into a descriptive text that conditions and guides a frozen detector. This linguistic conditioning replaces gradient-based adaptation, enabling robust generalization in data-scarce domains. We evaluate on UODD (underwater) and NEU-DET (industrial defects), two widely adopted benchmarks for data-scarce detection, where object boundaries are often ambiguous, and LAB-Det achieves up to 5.4 mAP improvement over state-of-the-art fine-tuned baselines without updating a single parameter. These results establish linguistic adaptation as an efficient and interpretable alternative to fine-tuning in specialized detection settings.

### [46] [SPARC: Separating Perception And Reasoning Circuits for Test-time Scaling of VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06566)
*Niccolo Avogaro,Nayanika Debnath,Li Mi,Thomas Frick,Junling Wang,Zexue He,Hang Hua,Konrad Schindler,Mattia Rigotti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPARC is a modular VLM framework that separates visual perception from reasoning, enabling independent test-time scaling, asymmetric compute allocation, and compressed contexts for more efficient and accurate visual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models have brittle test-time scaling where perception and reasoning are entangled in unstructured chains-of-thought, leading to error cascades and requiring expensive reinforcement learning with hand-crafted rewards.

Method: Two-stage pipeline inspired by brain processing: first performs explicit visual search to localize question-relevant regions, then conditions reasoning on those regions. Enables independent scaling, asymmetric compute allocation, and compressed contexts via global search at lower resolutions with high-resolution processing only for selected regions.

Result: Outperforms monolithic baselines and strong visual-grounding approaches on challenging visual reasoning benchmarks. Improves Qwen3VL-4B accuracy on V* VQA by 6.7 percentage points, surpasses "thinking with images" by 4.6 points on OOD task with 200× lower token budget.

Conclusion: SPARC's modular separation of perception and reasoning enables more robust, efficient, and accurate visual reasoning through independent optimization, asymmetric compute allocation, and context compression, addressing key limitations of current VLMs.

Abstract: Despite recent successes, test-time scaling - i.e., dynamically expanding the token budget during inference as needed - remains brittle for vision-language models (VLMs): unstructured chains-of-thought about images entangle perception and reasoning, leading to long, disorganized contexts where small perceptual mistakes may cascade into completely wrong answers. Moreover, expensive reinforcement learning with hand-crafted rewards is required to achieve good performance. Here, we introduce SPARC (Separating Perception And Reasoning Circuits), a modular framework that explicitly decouples visual perception from reasoning. Inspired by sequential sensory-to-cognitive processing in the brain, SPARC implements a two-stage pipeline where the model first performs explicit visual search to localize question-relevant regions, then conditions its reasoning on those regions to produce the final answer. This separation enables independent test-time scaling with asymmetric compute allocation (e.g., prioritizing perceptual processing under distribution shift), supports selective optimization (e.g., improving the perceptual stage alone when it is the bottleneck for end-to-end performance), and accommodates compressed contexts by running global search at lower image resolutions and allocating high-resolution processing only to selected regions, thereby reducing total visual tokens count and compute. Across challenging visual reasoning benchmarks, SPARC outperforms monolithic baselines and strong visual-grounding approaches. For instance, SPARC improves the accuracy of Qwen3VL-4B on the $V^*$ VQA benchmark by 6.7 percentage points, and it surpasses "thinking with images" by 4.6 points on a challenging OOD task despite requiring a 200$\times$ lower token budget.

*Mikołaj Janusz,Adam Wróbel,Bartosz Zieliński,Dawid Rymarczyk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProtoQuant uses vector quantization to create stable, interpretable prototypes without backbone finetuning, achieving competitive ImageNet performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prototypical parts models struggle with ImageNet-scale generalization, require expensive backbone finetuning, and suffer from prototype drift where prototypes lack grounding in training data and change under perturbations.

Method: ProtoQuant uses latent vector quantization to constrain prototypes to a discrete learned codebook within the latent space, ensuring they remain faithful representations of training data without updating the backbone, functioning as an efficient interpretable head.

Result: ProtoQuant achieves competitive classification accuracy on ImageNet and fine-grained benchmarks (CUB-200, Cars-196) while generalizing to ImageNet and achieving comparable interpretability metrics to other prototypical-parts-based methods.

Conclusion: ProtoQuant offers a scalable, stable approach to interpretable deep learning that addresses prototype drift and computational efficiency challenges in existing prototypical parts models.

Abstract: Prototypical parts-based models offer a "this looks like that" paradigm for intrinsic interpretability, yet they typically struggle with ImageNet-scale generalization and often require computationally expensive backbone finetuning. Furthermore, existing methods frequently suffer from "prototype drift," where learned prototypes lack tangible grounding in the training distribution and change their activation under small perturbations. We present ProtoQuant, a novel architecture that achieves prototype stability and grounded interpretability through latent vector quantization. By constraining prototypes to a discrete learned codebook within the latent space, we ensure they remain faithful representations of the training data without the need to update the backbone. This design allows ProtoQuant to function as an efficient, interpretable head that scales to large-scale datasets. We evaluate ProtoQuant on ImageNet and several fine-grained benchmarks (CUB-200, Cars-196). Our results demonstrate that ProtoQuant achieves competitive classification accuracy while generalizing to ImageNet and comparable interpretability metrics to other prototypical-parts-based methods.

*Hengfu Yu,Jinhong Deng,Lixin Duan,Wen Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RSCN addresses domain adaptive object detection when target domain has no object instances (only background), using background feature prototypes and relational consistency between source foreground and background features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DAOD methods assume target domain has sufficient foreground instances, but in many real-world scenarios (wildlife monitoring, lesion detection), collecting target data with objects is expensive while background-only data is abundant. This creates a technical challenge of adapting without target instances.

Method: Proposes Relational and Structural Consistency Network (RSCN) with alignment based on background feature prototypes and consistency in relationships between source foreground features and background features within each domain.

Result: RSCN significantly outperforms existing DAOD methods across three specialized benchmarks (simulative auto-driving detection, wildlife detection, lung nodule detection) in instance-free scenarios.

Conclusion: The paper introduces Instance-Free Domain Adaptive Object Detection as a novel problem, proposes RSCN as a solution, and provides benchmarks to facilitate research in this practical but challenging scenario.

Abstract: While Domain Adaptive Object Detection (DAOD) has made significant strides, most methods rely on unlabeled target data that is assumed to contain sufficient foreground instances. However, in many practical scenarios (e.g., wildlife monitoring, lesion detection), collecting target domain data with objects of interest is prohibitively costly, whereas background-only data is abundant. This common practical constraint introduces a significant technical challenge: the difficulty of achieving domain alignment when target instances are unavailable, forcing adaptation to rely solely on the target background information. We formulate this challenge as the novel problem of Instance-Free Domain Adaptive Object Detection. To tackle this, we propose the Relational and Structural Consistency Network (RSCN) which pioneers an alignment strategy based on background feature prototypes while simultaneously encouraging consistency in the relationship between the source foreground features and the background features within each domain, enabling robust adaptation even without target instances. To facilitate research, we further curate three specialized benchmarks, including simulative auto-driving detection, wildlife detection, and lung nodule detection. Extensive experiments show that RSCN significantly outperforms existing DAOD methods across all three benchmarks in the instance-free scenario. The code and benchmarks will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAVE is a new attribution method for Vision Transformers that produces stable, high-resolution attribution maps by decomposing gradients to separate stable components from architectural artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers have become dominant in computer vision, but existing attribution methods produce unstable, artifact-ridden maps due to architectural components like patch embeddings and attention routing. Many methods resort to coarse patch-level attributions instead of high-resolution pixel-level explanations.

Method: DAVE uses a structured decomposition of input gradients that exploits architectural properties of ViTs to isolate locally equivariant and stable components of the input-output mapping, separating them from architecture-induced artifacts and instability sources.

Result: The method produces stable and high-resolution attribution maps for Vision Transformers, overcoming the structured artifacts that plague existing methods.

Conclusion: DAVE provides a mathematically grounded attribution approach for ViTs that enables reliable, high-resolution explanation maps by properly handling architectural artifacts through gradient decomposition.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become a dominant architecture in computer vision, yet producing stable and high-resolution attribution maps for these models remains challenging. Architectural components such as patch embeddings and attention routing often introduce structured artifacts in pixel-level explanations, causing many existing methods to rely on coarse patch-level attributions. We introduce DAVE \textit{(\underline{D}istribution-aware \underline{A}ttribution via \underline{V}iT Gradient D\underline{E}composition)}, a mathematically grounded attribution method for ViTs based on a structured decomposition of the input gradient. By exploiting architectural properties of ViTs, DAVE isolates locally equivariant and stable components of the effective input--output mapping. It separates these from architecture-induced artifacts and other sources of instability.

*Zizhan Guo,Yi Feng,Mengtan Zhang,Haoran Zhang,Wei Ye,Rui Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new benchmark and method for unsupervised monocular 3D occupancy prediction that addresses training-evaluation inconsistency and occlusion ambiguity in autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised 3D reconstruction methods have two main issues: 1) inconsistency between training (neural radiance fields) and evaluation (occupancy probabilities) protocols, and 2) reliance on 2D ground truth that fails to handle ambiguity in occluded regions due to insufficient geometric constraints.

Method: 1) Reformulated benchmark with physically consistent occupancy probability representation derived from volume rendering variables; 2) Improved evaluation protocol aligning this representation with voxel-wise 3D occupancy ground truth; 3) Occlusion-aware polarization mechanism incorporating multi-view visual cues to better discriminate occupied vs. free spaces in occluded regions.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach significantly outperforms existing unsupervised methods and matches the performance of supervised approaches.

Conclusion: The paper presents a comprehensive solution addressing both protocol inconsistency and occlusion ambiguity in unsupervised monocular 3D occupancy prediction, with code and evaluation protocol to be made available.

Abstract: Inferring the 3D structure from a single image, particularly in occluded regions, remains a fundamental yet unsolved challenge in vision-centric autonomous driving. Existing unsupervised approaches typically train a neural radiance field and treat the network outputs as occupancy probabilities during evaluation, overlooking the inconsistency between training and evaluation protocols. Moreover, the prevalent use of 2D ground truth fails to reveal the inherent ambiguity in occluded regions caused by insufficient geometric constraints. To address these issues, this paper presents a reformulated benchmark for unsupervised monocular 3D occupancy prediction. We first interpret the variables involved in the volume rendering process and identify the most physically consistent representation of the occupancy probability. Building on these analyses, we improve existing evaluation protocols by aligning the newly identified representation with voxel-wise 3D occupancy ground truth, thereby enabling unsupervised methods to be evaluated in a manner consistent with that of supervised approaches. Additionally, to impose explicit constraints in occluded regions, we introduce an occlusion-aware polarization mechanism that incorporates multi-view visual cues to enhance discrimination between occupied and free spaces in these regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only significantly outperforms existing unsupervised approaches but also matches the performance of supervised ones. Our source code and evaluation protocol will be made available upon publication.

TL;DR: DreamHome-Pano is a controllable panoramic interior generation framework that balances architectural constraints with stylistic preferences using a Prompt-LLM for semantic translation and conflict-free control architecture to prevent condition conflicts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-condition generative frameworks struggle to harmonize rigid architectural constraints with stylistic preferences, leading to "condition conflicts" where style compromises geometric precision in interior layout generation.

Method: Introduces Prompt-LLM as semantic bridge to translate layout constraints and style references into professional prompts; develops Conflict-Free Control architecture with structural-aware geometric priors and multi-condition decoupling; establishes panoramic interior benchmark with multi-stage training pipeline (SFT + RL).

Result: Achieves superior balance between aesthetic quality and structural consistency, offering robust professional-grade solution for panoramic interior visualization.

Conclusion: DreamHome-Pano provides effective framework for high-fidelity interior synthesis that maintains architectural integrity while accommodating stylistic preferences, solving the condition conflict problem in multi-condition generative systems.

Abstract: In modern interior design, the generation of personalized spaces frequently necessitates a delicate balance between rigid architectural structural constraints and specific stylistic preferences. However, existing multi-condition generative frameworks often struggle to harmonize these inputs, leading to "condition conflicts" where stylistic attributes inadvertently compromise the geometric precision of the layout. To address this challenge, we present DreamHome-Pano, a controllable panoramic generation framework designed for high-fidelity interior synthesis. Our approach introduces a Prompt-LLM that serves as a semantic bridge, effectively translating layout constraints and style references into professional descriptive prompts to achieve precise cross-modal alignment. To safeguard architectural integrity during the generative process, we develop a Conflict-Free Control architecture that incorporates structural-aware geometric priors and a multi-condition decoupling strategy, effectively suppressing stylistic interference from eroding the spatial layout. Furthermore, we establish a comprehensive panoramic interior benchmark alongside a multi-stage training pipeline, encompassing progressive Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Experimental results demonstrate that DreamHome-Pano achieves a superior balance between aesthetic quality and structural consistency, offering a robust and professional-grade solution for panoramic interior visualization.

TL;DR: Depth2CHM uses monocular depth estimation (Depth Anything V2) trained on airborne LiDAR canopy height data to estimate continuous forest canopy height from PlanetScope RGB imagery, achieving improved accuracy over existing global products.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for large-scale, high-resolution forest canopy height mapping to understand carbon/water cycles, but current spaceborne LiDAR (ICESat-2, GEDI) is spatially sparse with uncertainties, while airborne/UAV LiDAR provides finer measurements but limited coverage.

Method: Trained Depth Anything V2 model using ~16,000 km² of airborne LiDAR-derived canopy height models (CHMs) with corresponding 3m resolution PlanetScope and airborne RGB imagery across multiple countries to create Depth2CHM for estimating CHMs directly from RGB imagery.

Result: Depth2CHM accurately estimated canopy height with biases of 0.59m (China) and 0.41m (US), RMSEs of 2.54m and 5.75m respectively, reducing mean absolute error by ~1.5m and RMSE by ~2m compared to existing global CHM products.

Conclusion: Monocular depth estimation networks trained with large-scale airborne LiDAR data provide a promising, scalable pathway for high-resolution, spatially continuous forest canopy height estimation from satellite RGB imagery.

Abstract: Large-scale, high-resolution forest canopy height mapping plays a crucial role in understanding regional and global carbon and water cycles. Spaceborne LiDAR missions, including the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) and the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), provide global observations of forest structure but are spatially sparse and subject to inherent uncertainties. In contrast, near-surface LiDAR platforms, such as airborne and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) LiDAR systems, offer much finer measurements of forest canopy structure, and a growing number of countries have made these datasets openly available. In this study, a state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation model, Depth Anything V2, was trained using approximately 16,000 km2 of canopy height models (CHMs) derived from publicly available airborne LiDAR point clouds and related products across multiple countries, together with 3 m resolution PlanetScope and airborne RGB imagery. The trained model, referred to as Depth2CHM, enables the estimation of spatially continuous CHMs directly from PlanetScope RGB imagery. Independent validation was conducted at sites in China (approximately 1 km2) and the United States (approximately 116 km2). The results showed that Depth2CHM could accurately estimate canopy height, with biases of 0.59 m and 0.41 m and root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 2.54 m and 5.75 m for these two sites, respectively. Compared with an existing global meter-resolution CHM product, the mean absolute error is reduced by approximately 1.5 m and the RMSE by approximately 2 m. These results demonstrated that monocular depth estimation networks trained with large-scale airborne LiDAR-derived canopy height data provide a promising and scalable pathway for high-resolution, spatially continuous forest canopy height estimation from satellite RGB imagery.

TL;DR: Using generative AI representations from satellite imagery to identify gold-bearing regions, improving accuracy from 0.51 to 0.68 at patch level.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Satellite imagery offers cost-effective large-scale mineral exploration compared to expensive on-site data collection, but needs better methods to extract meaningful mineralogical patterns from limited labeled data.

Method: Uses Isometric autoencoder foundation model pretrained on FalconSpace-S2 v1.0 dataset to generate spectral-spatial representations from Sentinel-2 imagery, then feeds these embeddings to lightweight XGBoost classifier for gold identification.

Result: Method improves patch-level accuracy from 0.51 to 0.68 and image-level accuracy from 0.55 to 0.73 on dataset of 63 Sentinel-2 images from known gold/non-gold locations.

Conclusion: Generative embeddings from foundation models can capture transferable mineralogical patterns even with limited labeled data, making mineral exploration more efficient, scalable, and globally applicable.

Abstract: Satellite imagery is employed for large-scale prospectivity mapping due to the high cost and typically limited availability of on-site mineral exploration data. In this work, we present a proof-of-concept framework that leverages generative representations learned from multispectral Sentinel-2 imagery to identify gold-bearing regions from space. An autoencoder foundation model, called Isometric, which is pretrained on the large-scale FalconSpace-S2 v1.0 dataset, produces information-dense spectral-spatial representations that serve as inputs to a lightweight XGBoost classifier. We compare this representation-based approach with a raw spectral input baseline using a dataset of 63 Sentinel-2 images from known gold and non-gold locations. The proposed method improves patch-level accuracy from 0.51 to 0.68 and image-level accuracy from 0.55 to 0.73, demonstrating that generative embeddings capture transferable mineralogical patterns even with limited labeled data. These results highlight the potential of foundation-model representations to make mineral exploration more efficient, scalable, and globally applicable.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FloorplanVLM converts raster floorplans to vector graphics using an image-to-sequence approach with progressive training, achieving 92.52% wall IoU on complex layouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Converting raster floorplans to engineering-grade vector graphics is challenging due to complex topology and strict geometric constraints. Existing methods (pixel-based heuristics or query-based transformers) produce fragmented results and struggle with complex geometries like slanted walls and curved arcs.

Method: FloorplanVLM reformulates floorplan vectorization as image-conditioned sequence modeling, directly outputting structured JSON sequences representing global topology. Uses a scalable data engine with Floorplan-2M dataset and Floorplan-HQ-300K subset. Employs progressive training: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for structural grounding, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for geometric alignment.

Result: Achieves 92.52% external-wall IoU on FPBench-2K benchmark, demonstrates exceptional structural validity and robust generalization across non-Manhattan architectures. Outperforms existing methods in handling complex geometries.

Conclusion: FloorplanVLM's pixels-to-sequence paradigm enables precise constraint satisfaction for complex floorplan geometries, providing a unified framework for high-quality floorplan vectorization that generalizes well to diverse architectural styles.

Abstract: Converting raster floorplans into engineering-grade vector graphics is challenging due to complex topology and strict geometric constraints. To address this, we present FloorplanVLM, a unified framework that reformulates floorplan vectorization as an image-conditioned sequence modeling task. Unlike pixel-based methods that rely on fragile heuristics or query-based transformers that generate fragmented rooms, our model directly outputs structured JSON sequences representing the global topology. This 'pixels-to-sequence' paradigm enables the precise and holistic constraint satisfaction of complex geometries, such as slanted walls and curved arcs. To support this data-hungry approach, we introduce a scalable data engine: we construct a large-scale dataset (Floorplan-2M) and a high-fidelity subset (Floorplan-HQ-300K) to balance geometric diversity and pixel-level precision. We then employ a progressive training strategy, using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for structural grounding and quality annealing, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for strict geometric alignment. To standardize evaluation on complex layouts, we establish and open-source FPBench-2K. Evaluated on this rigorous benchmark, FloorplanVLM demonstrates exceptional structural validity, achieving $\textbf{92.52%}$ external-wall IoU and robust generalization across non-Manhattan architectures.

*Chao Zhou,Tianyi Wei,Yiling Chen,Wenbo Zhou,Nenghai Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PKA framework eliminates redundancies in multi-condition control for Diffusion Transformers, achieving 10x speedup and 5x VRAM saving through position-aligned and keyword-scoped attention with conditional sensitivity-aware sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models lack fine-grained control for specific requirements like spatial layouts or subject appearances. Multi-condition control in Diffusion Transformers suffers from quadratic computational/memory overhead due to inefficient "concatenate-and-attend" strategy with redundant cross-modal interactions.

Method: Proposes Position-aligned and Keyword-scoped Attention (PKA): 1) Position-Aligned Attention (PAA) linearizes spatial control via localized patch alignment, 2) Keyword-Scoped Attention (KSA) prunes irrelevant subject-driven interactions using semantic-aware masking, and 3) Conditional Sensitivity-Aware Sampling (CSAS) reweights training toward critical denoising phases for faster convergence.

Result: Achieves 10.0× inference speedup and 5.1× VRAM saving compared to conventional approaches, providing scalable and resource-friendly high-fidelity multi-conditioned generation.

Conclusion: PKA framework effectively eliminates spatial and semantic redundancies in multi-condition control for Diffusion Transformers, offering a practical solution for efficient, high-fidelity conditional image generation with significant computational benefits.

Abstract: While modern text-to-image models excel at prompt-based generation, they often lack the fine-grained control necessary for specific user requirements like spatial layouts or subject appearances. Multi-condition control addresses this, yet its integration into Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) is bottlenecked by the conventional ``concatenate-and-attend'' strategy, which suffers from quadratic computational and memory overhead as the number of conditions scales. Our analysis reveals that much of this cross-modal interaction is spatially or semantically redundant. To this end, we propose Position-aligned and Keyword-scoped Attention (PKA), a highly efficient framework designed to eliminate these redundancies. Specifically, Position-Aligned Attention (PAA) linearizes spatial control by enforcing localized patch alignment, while Keyword-Scoped Attention (KSA) prunes irrelevant subject-driven interactions via semantic-aware masking. To facilitate efficient learning, we further introduce a Conditional Sensitivity-Aware Sampling (CSAS) strategy that reweights the training objective towards critical denoising phases, drastically accelerating convergence and enhancing conditional fidelity. Empirically, PKA delivers a 10.0$\times$ inference speedup and a 5.1$\times$ VRAM saving, providing a scalable and resource-friendly solution for high-fidelity multi-conditioned generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MicroBi-ConvLSTM: Ultra-lightweight (11.4K params) convolutional-recurrent architecture for HAR on microcontrollers, achieving 2.9x parameter reduction vs TinierHAR while maintaining competitive accuracy across 8 benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lightweight HAR models like TinierHAR (34K params) and TinyHAR (55K params) exceed memory budgets of microcontrollers when considering OS overhead, requiring even more compact solutions for resource-constrained wearables.

Method: Two-stage convolutional feature extraction with 4x temporal pooling followed by a single bidirectional LSTM layer, achieving O(N) linear complexity and 11.4K average parameters.

Result: Competitive performance: 93.41% macro F1 on UCI-HAR, 94.46% on SKODA, 88.98% on Daphnet. INT8 quantization yields only 0.21% F1 degradation and 23.0 KB deployment footprint suitable for edge devices.

Conclusion: MicroBi-ConvLSTM successfully achieves ultra-lightweight design (11.4K params) while maintaining competitive HAR performance, with bidirectionality particularly beneficial for episodic event detection tasks.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) on resource constrained wearables requires models that balance accuracy against strict memory and computational budgets. State of the art lightweight architectures such as TinierHAR (34K parameters) and TinyHAR (55K parameters) achieve strong accuracy, but exceed memory budgets of microcontrollers with limited SRAM once operating system overhead is considered. We present MicroBi-ConvLSTM, an ultra-lightweight convolutional-recurrent architecture achieving 11.4K parameters on average through two stage convolutional feature extraction with 4x temporal pooling and a single bidirectional LSTM layer. This represents 2.9x parameter reduction versus TinierHAR and 11.9x versus DeepConvLSTM while preserving linear O(N) complexity. Evaluation across eight diverse HAR benchmarks shows that MicroBi-ConvLSTM maintains competitive performance within the ultra-lightweight regime: 93.41% macro F1 on UCI-HAR, 94.46% on SKODA assembly gestures, and 88.98% on Daphnet gait freeze detection. Systematic ablation reveals task dependent component contributions where bidirectionality benefits episodic event detection, but provides marginal gains on periodic locomotion. INT8 post training quantization incurs only 0.21% average F1-score degradation, yielding a 23.0 KB average deployment footprint suitable for memory constrained edge devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing scale of state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models has created a significant gap between high-performance models and practical on-device solutions, limiting accessibility and real-time applications.

Method: Three key techniques: (1) Model compression via pruning redundant components in diffusion transformers (12B→2B), (2) ResNet-based token downsampling for reduced latency while preserving high-resolution processing, (3) Novel text encoder distillation using visual signals from early denoiser layers during sampling.

Result: NanoFLUX generates 512×512 images in approximately 2.5 seconds on mobile devices, demonstrating the feasibility of high-quality on-device text-to-image generation while maintaining generation quality.

Conclusion: The progressive compression pipeline successfully bridges the gap between state-of-the-art models and on-device solutions, enabling practical high-quality text-to-image generation on mobile devices with minimal latency.

Abstract: While large-scale text-to-image diffusion models continue to improve in visual quality, their increasing scale has widened the gap between state-of-the-art models and on-device solutions. To address this gap, we introduce NanoFLUX, a 2.4B text-to-image flow-matching model distilled from 17B FLUX.1-Schnell using a progressive compression pipeline designed to preserve generation quality. Our contributions include: (1) A model compression strategy driven by pruning redundant components in the diffusion transformer, reducing its size from 12B to 2B; (2) A ResNet-based token downsampling mechanism that reduces latency by allowing intermediate blocks to operate on lower-resolution tokens while preserving high-resolution processing elsewhere; (3) A novel text encoder distillation approach that leverages visual signals from early layers of the denoiser during sampling. Empirically, NanoFLUX generates 512 x 512 images in approximately 2.5 seconds on mobile devices, demonstrating the feasibility of high-quality on-device text-to-image generation.

*Mingyu Dou,Shi Qiu,Ming Hu,Yifan Chen,Huping Ye,Xiaohan Liao,Zhe Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaptOVCD is a training-free open-vocabulary change detection framework that uses multi-level information fusion across data, feature, and decision levels to detect arbitrary category changes without predefined categories or pixel-level annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing change detection methods rely on predefined categories and large-scale pixel-level annotations, limiting their generalization and applicability in open-world scenarios where arbitrary changes need to be detected without training.

Method: Dual-dimensional multi-level information fusion framework: vertical integration across data, feature, and decision levels with horizontal adaptive designs. Uses Adaptive Radiometric Alignment (ARA) with SAM-HQ for segmentation, Adaptive Change Thresholding (ACT) with DINOv3 for detection, and Adaptive Confidence Filtering (ACF) with DGTRS-CLIP for semantic identification.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing training-free methods, achieves 84.89% of fully-supervised performance upper bound in cross-dataset evaluations, demonstrates superior generalization across nine scenarios, and detects arbitrary category changes in zero-shot manner.

Conclusion: AdaptOVCD effectively addresses limitations of existing change detection methods by enabling open-vocabulary change detection without training, achieving strong performance through synergistic integration of heterogeneous pre-trained models and multi-level information fusion.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection plays a pivotal role in domains such as environmental monitoring, urban planning, and disaster assessment. However, existing methods typically rely on predefined categories and large-scale pixel-level annotations, which limit their generalization and applicability in open-world scenarios. To address these limitations, this paper proposes AdaptOVCD, a training-free Open-Vocabulary Change Detection (OVCD) architecture based on dual-dimensional multi-level information fusion. The framework integrates multi-level information fusion across data, feature, and decision levels vertically while incorporating targeted adaptive designs horizontally, achieving deep synergy among heterogeneous pre-trained models to effectively mitigate error propagation. Specifically, (1) at the data level, Adaptive Radiometric Alignment (ARA) fuses radiometric statistics with original texture features and synergizes with SAM-HQ to achieve radiometrically consistent segmentation; (2) at the feature level, Adaptive Change Thresholding (ACT) combines global difference distributions with edge structure priors and leverages DINOv3 to achieve robust change detection; (3) at the decision level, Adaptive Confidence Filtering (ACF) integrates semantic confidence with spatial constraints and collaborates with DGTRS-CLIP to achieve high-confidence semantic identification. Comprehensive evaluations across nine scenarios demonstrate that AdaptOVCD detects arbitrary category changes in a zero-shot manner, significantly outperforming existing training-free methods. Meanwhile, it achieves 84.89\% of the fully-supervised performance upper bound in cross-dataset evaluations and exhibits superior generalization capabilities.

*Juan Gutiérrez,Victor Gutiérrez-Garcia,José Luis Blanco-Murillo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PANC: Weakly supervised spectral segmentation using minimal annotations (5-30 tokens) to produce stable, controllable object masks by augmenting affinity graphs with anchor priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised segmentation methods are non-deterministic, sensitive to initialization, and naively seek salient objects. Need for stable, reproducible, user-controllable segmentation with minimal annotation cost.

Method: Augments TokenCut's token-token affinity graph with annotated visual token priors coupled to anchor nodes. Manipulates graph topology to bias spectral eigenspace toward annotation-consistent partitions while preserving global grouping from self-supervised features.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks (DUTS-TE, ECSSD, MS COCO) with only 5-30 annotations. Particularly excels in challenging domains: 96.8% mIoU on CrackForest (+14.43%), 78.0% on CUB-200-2011 (+0.2%), 78.8% on HAM10000 (+0.37%). Enables explicit user-controllable semantic segmentation for multi-object scenarios.

Conclusion: PANC provides training-free, weakly supervised segmentation that trades minimal annotations for significant gains in reproducibility, user control, and segmentation quality, especially valuable in domains with costly dense labels or subtle intra-class differences.

Abstract: Fully unsupervised segmentation pipelines naively seek the most salient object, should this be present. As a result, most of the methods reported in the literature deliver non-deterministic partitions that are sensitive to initialization, seed order, and threshold heuristics.
  We propose PANC, a weakly supervised spectral segmentation framework that uses a minimal set of annotated visual tokens to produce stable, controllable, and reproducible object masks. From the TokenCut approach, we augment the token-token affinity graph with a handful of priors coupled to anchor nodes. By manipulating the graph topology, we bias the spectral eigenspace toward partitions that are consistent with the annotations. Our approach preserves the global grouping enforced by dense self-supervised visual features, trading annotated tokens for significant gains in reproducibility, user control, and segmentation quality.
  Using 5 to 30 annotations per dataset, our training-free method achieves state-of-the-art performance among weakly and unsupervised approaches on standard benchmarks (e.g., DUTS-TE, ECSSD, MS COCO). Contrarily, it excels in domains where dense labels are costly or intra-class differences are subtle. We report strong and reliable results on homogeneous, fine-grained, and texture-limited domains, achieving 96.8% (+14.43% over SotA), 78.0% (+0.2%), and 78.8% (+0.37%) average mean intersection-over-union (mIoU) on CrackForest (CFD), CUB-200-2011, and HAM10000 datasets, respectively. For multi-object benchmarks, the framework showcases explicit, user-controllable semantic segmentation.

*Haipeng Li,Rongxuan Peng,Anwei Luo,Shunquan Tan,Changsheng Chen,Anastasia Antsiferova*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ForgeryEraser is an anti-forensics attack framework that exploits vulnerabilities in AIGC detectors by manipulating image embeddings in Vision-Language Model feature spaces to erase forgery traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AIGC authenticity assessment protocols overlook anti-forensics attacks, failing to ensure comprehensive robustness of detectors in real-world applications where attackers may try to evade detection.

Method: Uses multi-modal guidance loss to drive forged image embeddings within VLM feature spaces toward text-derived authentic anchors while repelling them from forgery anchors, without needing access to target detectors.

Result: Causes substantial performance degradation to advanced AIGC detectors on both global synthesis and local editing benchmarks, and induces explainable forensic models to generate authentic-looking explanations for forged images.

Conclusion: Reveals adversarial vulnerabilities in AIGC detectors due to reliance on shared VLM backbones, demonstrating the need for more robust authentication methods against anti-forensics attacks.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-Generated Content (AIGC) technologies poses significant challenges for authenticity assessment. However, existing evaluation protocols largely overlook anti-forensics attack, failing to ensure the comprehensive robustness of state-of-the-art AIGC detectors in real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we propose ForgeryEraser, a framework designed to execute universal anti-forensics attack without access to the target AIGC detectors. We reveal an adversarial vulnerability stemming from the systemic reliance on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as shared backbones (e.g., CLIP), where downstream AIGC detectors inherit the feature space of these publicly accessible models. Instead of traditional logit-based optimization, we design a multi-modal guidance loss to drive forged image embeddings within the VLM feature space toward text-derived authentic anchors to erase forgery traces, while repelling them from forgery anchors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ForgeryEraser causes substantial performance degradation to advanced AIGC detectors on both global synthesis and local editing benchmarks. Moreover, ForgeryEraser induces explainable forensic models to generate explanations consistent with authentic images for forged images. Our code will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NECromancer is a universal motion tokenizer that works with any BVH skeleton, enabling cross-species motion transfer and analysis through skeletal structure encoding and topology-agnostic compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion tokenization methods are limited to specific skeletons, restricting their applicability across different morphologies and species.

Method: Three components: (1) Ontology-aware Skeletal Graph Encoder (OwO) for structural priors, (2) Topology-Agnostic Tokenizer (TAT) for universal discrete representation, (3) Unified BVH Universe (UvU) dataset of heterogeneous skeletons.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity reconstruction under compression, disentangles motion from skeletal structure, enables cross-species motion transfer, composition, denoising, generation, and text-motion retrieval.

Conclusion: Establishes a unified framework for motion analysis and synthesis across diverse morphologies, overcoming species-specific limitations of previous approaches.

Abstract: Motion tokenization is a key component of generalizable motion models, yet most existing approaches are restricted to species-specific skeletons, limiting their applicability across diverse morphologies. We propose NECromancer (NEC), a universal motion tokenizer that operates directly on arbitrary BVH skeletons. NEC consists of three components: (1) an Ontology-aware Skeletal Graph Encoder (OwO) that encodes structural priors from BVH files, including joint semantics, rest-pose offsets, and skeletal topology, into skeletal embeddings; (2) a Topology-Agnostic Tokenizer (TAT) that compresses motion sequences into a universal, topology-invariant discrete representation; and (3) the Unified BVH Universe (UvU), a large-scale dataset aggregating BVH motions across heterogeneous skeletons. Experiments show that NEC achieves high-fidelity reconstruction under substantial compression and effectively disentangles motion from skeletal structure. The resulting token space supports cross-species motion transfer, composition, denoising, generation with token-based models, and text-motion retrieval, establishing a unified framework for motion analysis and synthesis across diverse morphologies.

*Viktoria Ehm,Paul Roetzer,Florian Bernard,Daniel Cremers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First integer linear programming approach for partial-partial 3D shape matching that handles unknown overlapping regions using geometric consistency priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Partial-partial 3D shape matching is the most realistic setting (e.g., 3D scanning) but has been under-explored due to challenges of finding correspondences while determining unknown overlapping regions.

Method: Integer linear programming approach leveraging geometric consistency as a strong prior to robustly estimate overlapping regions and compute neighborhood-preserving correspondences.

Result: Achieves high-quality matching results in terms of matching error and smoothness, and shows better scalability than previous formalisms.

Conclusion: The proposed integer linear programming approach effectively addresses the unique challenges of partial-partial 3D shape matching, providing robust and scalable solutions for realistic scenarios.

Abstract: The task of establishing correspondences between two 3D shapes is a long-standing challenge in computer vision. While numerous studies address full-full and partial-full 3D shape matching, only a limited number of works have explored the partial-partial setting, very likely due to its unique challenges: we must compute accurate correspondences while at the same time find the unknown overlapping region. Nevertheless, partial-partial 3D shape matching reflects the most realistic setting, as in many real-world cases, such as 3D scanning, shapes are only partially observable. In this work, we introduce the first integer linear programming approach specifically designed to address the distinctive challenges of partial-partial shape matching. Our method leverages geometric consistency as a strong prior, enabling both robust estimation of the overlapping region and computation of neighbourhood-preserving correspondences. We empirically demonstrate that our approach achieves high-quality matching results both in terms of matching error and smoothness. Moreover, we show that our method is more scalable than previous formalisms.

Motivation: Surgical phase recognition is crucial for intelligent operating rooms, but faces challenges due to limited annotated clinical videos and large domain gaps between synthetic and real surgical data, making robust model training difficult.

Method: Proposes CauCLIP framework that integrates: 1) frequency-based augmentation to perturb domain-specific attributes while preserving semantic structures, and 2) a causal suppression loss to mitigate non-causal biases and reinforce causal surgical features, all within a unified training framework using CLIP for domain-invariant representation learning.

Result: Experiments on the SurgVisDom hard adaptation benchmark show that CauCLIP substantially outperforms all competing approaches, demonstrating superior domain generalization for surgical video understanding.

Conclusion: Causality-guided vision-language models are effective for domain-generalizable surgical video understanding, with CauCLIP providing a robust solution for surgical phase recognition without requiring target domain data.

Abstract: Surgical phase recognition is a critical component for context-aware decision support in intelligent operating rooms, yet training robust models is hindered by limited annotated clinical videos and large domain gaps between synthetic and real surgical data. To address this, we propose CauCLIP, a causality-inspired vision-language framework that leverages CLIP to learn domain-invariant representations for surgical phase recognition without access to target domain data. Our approach integrates a frequency-based augmentation strategy to perturb domain-specific attributes while preserving semantic structures, and a causal suppression loss that mitigates non-causal biases and reinforces causal surgical features. These components are combined in a unified training framework that enables the model to focus on stable causal factors underlying surgical workflows. Experiments on the SurgVisDom hard adaptation benchmark demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms all competing approaches, highlighting the effectiveness of causality-guided vision-language models for domain-generalizable surgical video understanding.

Motivation: Current unified multimodal models (UMMs) show impressive image generation and multimodal reasoning, but their potential for computer-use planning tasks remains underexplored. These tasks require spatial reasoning and procedural understanding capabilities that haven't been systematically evaluated.

Method: Created PlanViz benchmark with three sub-tasks: route planning, work diagramming, and web&UI displaying. Used human-annotated questions and reference images with quality control. Developed PlanScore - a task-adaptive evaluation metric for correctness, visual quality, and efficiency.

Result: Through experiments, the benchmark revealed key limitations and opportunities for future research in multimodal models' capabilities for computer-use planning tasks.

Conclusion: PlanViz provides a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate UMMs' image generation and editing capabilities for practical computer-use planning tasks, highlighting current limitations and research directions.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) have shown impressive capabilities in generating natural images and supporting multimodal reasoning. However, their potential in supporting computer-use planning tasks, which are closely related to our lives, remain underexplored. Image generation and editing in computer-use tasks require capabilities like spatial reasoning and procedural understanding, and it is still unknown whether UMMs have these capabilities to finish these tasks or not. Therefore, we propose PlanViz, a new benchmark designed to evaluate image generation and editing for computer-use tasks. To achieve the goal of our evaluation, we focus on sub-tasks which frequently involve in daily life and require planning steps. Specifically, three new sub-tasks are designed: route planning, work diagramming, and web&UI displaying. We address challenges in data quality ensuring by curating human-annotated questions and reference images, and a quality control process. For challenges of comprehensive and exact evaluation, a task-adaptive score, PlanScore, is proposed. The score helps understanding the correctness, visual quality and efficiency of generated images. Through experiments, we highlight key limitations and opportunities for future research on this topic.

Method: Created CytoCrowd dataset with 446 high-resolution cytology images, each containing: (1) raw conflicting annotations from four independent pathologists, and (2) separate high-quality gold-standard ground truth established by senior expert.

Result: CytoCrowd serves as versatile benchmark for both standard computer vision tasks (object detection/classification using ground truth) and realistic testbed for annotation aggregation algorithms. Comprehensive baseline results demonstrate dataset challenges and value.

Conclusion: CytoCrowd bridges the gap between clean ground truth datasets and multiple annotation datasets, providing valuable resource for developing next-generation medical image analysis models that can handle real-world expert disagreement.

Abstract: High-quality annotated datasets are crucial for advancing machine learning in medical image analysis. However, a critical gap exists: most datasets either offer a single, clean ground truth, which hides real-world expert disagreement, or they provide multiple annotations without a separate gold standard for objective evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce CytoCrowd, a new public benchmark for cytology analysis. The dataset features 446 high-resolution images, each with two key components: (1) raw, conflicting annotations from four independent pathologists, and (2) a separate, high-quality gold-standard ground truth established by a senior expert. This dual structure makes CytoCrowd a versatile resource. It serves as a benchmark for standard computer vision tasks, such as object detection and classification, using the ground truth. Simultaneously, it provides a realistic testbed for evaluating annotation aggregation algorithms that must resolve expert disagreements. We provide comprehensive baseline results for both tasks. Our experiments demonstrate the challenges presented by CytoCrowd and establish its value as a resource for developing the next generation of models for medical image analysis.

TL;DR: SICA is the first monolithic fake image detection paradigm that uses high-level semantics as structural prior to reconstruct unified-yet-discriminative artifact feature space, outperforming 15 SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monolithic FID models theoretically outperform ensemble approaches but consistently underperform in practice due to artifact feature space collapse caused by heterogeneous artifacts across forensic subdomains.

Method: Proposes Semantic-Induced Constrained Adaptation (SICA), using high-level semantics as structural prior to reconstruct unified-yet-discriminative artifact feature space, addressing the paradoxical challenge of unified detection across heterogeneous subdomains.

Result: Extensive experiments on OpenMMSec dataset show SICA outperforms 15 state-of-the-art methods and reconstructs target feature space in near-orthogonal manner, validating the hypothesis.

Conclusion: SICA successfully addresses the core challenge of monolithic FID by leveraging semantic priors to reconstruct artifact feature space, enabling practical unified detection across heterogeneous forensic subdomains.

Abstract: Fake Image Detection (FID), aiming at unified detection across four image forensic subdomains, is critical in real-world forensic scenarios. Compared with ensemble approaches, monolithic FID models are theoretically more promising, but to date, consistently yield inferior performance in practice. In this work, by discovering the ``heterogeneous phenomenon'', which is the intrinsic distinctness of artifacts across subdomains, we diagnose the cause of this underperformance for the first time: the collapse of the artifact feature space driven by such phenomenon. The core challenge for developing a practical monolithic FID model thus boils down to the ``unified-yet-discriminative" reconstruction of the artifact feature space. To address this paradoxical challenge, we hypothesize that high-level semantics can serve as a structural prior for the reconstruction, and further propose Semantic-Induced Constrained Adaptation (SICA), the first monolithic FID paradigm. Extensive experiments on our OpenMMSec dataset demonstrate that SICA outperforms 15 state-of-the-art methods and reconstructs the target unified-yet-discriminative artifact feature space in a near-orthogonal manner, thus firmly validating our hypothesis.

Conclusion: Provides a robust, interpretable, and clinically grounded foundation for scalable, non-invasive AIS assessment, addressing key limitations of current methods.

Abstract: Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a prevalent spinal deformity whose progression can be mitigated through early detection. Conventional screening methods are often subjective, difficult to scale, and reliant on specialized clinical expertise. Video-based gait analysis offers a promising alternative, but current datasets and methods frequently suffer from data leakage, where performance is inflated by repeated clips from the same individual, or employ oversimplified models that lack clinical interpretability. To address these limitations, we introduce ScoliGait, a new benchmark dataset comprising 1,572 gait video clips for training and 300 fully independent clips for testing. Each clip is annotated with radiographic Cobb angles and descriptive text based on clinical kinematic priors. We propose a multi-modal framework that integrates a clinical-prior-guided kinematic knowledge map for interpretable feature representation, alongside a latent attention pooling mechanism to fuse video, text, and knowledge map modalities. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art, demonstrating a significant performance gap on a realistic, non-repeating subject benchmark. Our approach establishes a new state of the art, showing a significant performance gain on a realistic, subject-independent benchmark. This work provides a robust, interpretable, and clinically grounded foundation for scalable, non-invasive AIS assessment.

### [68] [Revisiting Emotions Representation for Recognition in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06778)
*Joao Baptista Cardia Neto,Claudio Ferrari,Stefano Berretti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel approach to describe complex emotional states as probability distributions over emotion classes by automatically re-labeling existing datasets using VAD space mappings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional single-label emotion classification oversimplifies complex emotional states, which are often combinations of multiple emotions at different intensities. Existing distribution learning approaches are limited by datasets annotated with single emotion classes.

Method: Automatically re-labels existing datasets by mapping both basic and compound emotions to probability distributions in the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) space. Given face images annotated with VAD values, estimates likelihood of belonging to each distribution to describe emotional states as mixtures of emotions.

Result: Preliminary experiments illustrate advantages of the solution and open new investigation directions. Annotations are publicly available on GitHub.

Conclusion: Proposes a promising approach to enrich emotion description by representing complex emotional states as probability distributions, accounting for ambiguous perception and enabling more nuanced facial emotion recognition.

Abstract: Facial emotion recognition has been typically cast as a single-label classification problem of one out of six prototypical emotions. However, that is an oversimplification that is unsuitable for representing the multifaceted spectrum of spontaneous emotional states, which are most often the result of a combination of multiple emotions contributing at different intensities. Building on this, a promising direction that was explored recently is to cast emotion recognition as a distribution learning problem. Still, such approaches are limited in that research datasets are typically annotated with a single emotion class. In this paper, we contribute a novel approach to describe complex emotional states as probability distributions over a set of emotion classes. To do so, we propose a solution to automatically re-label existing datasets by exploiting the result of a study in which a large set of both basic and compound emotions is mapped to probability distributions in the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) space. In this way, given a face image annotated with VAD values, we can estimate the likelihood of it belonging to each of the distributions, so that emotional states can be described as a mixture of emotions, enriching their description, while also accounting for the ambiguous nature of their perception. In a preliminary set of experiments, we illustrate the advantages of this solution and a new possible direction of investigation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Computer vision approach automates sweetpotato weevil damage assessment using classification models (71.43% accuracy) and YOLO12 object detection (77.7% mAP), improving phenotyping efficiency for breeding programs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional manual scoring of sweetpotato weevil damage is labor-intensive, subjective, and inconsistent, hindering breeding programs for resilient varieties in sub-Saharan Africa.

Method: Computer vision approach with classification models for field damage severity assessment and YOLO12 object detection with two-stage pipeline (root segmentation + tiling strategy) for laboratory detection of small feeding holes.

Result: Field classification achieved 71.43% test accuracy; laboratory YOLO12 detection achieved 77.7% mean average precision for identifying minute weevil feeding holes.

Conclusion: Computer vision provides efficient, objective, scalable assessment tools that enhance phenotyping efficiency in sweetpotato breeding programs and help mitigate weevil impacts on food security.

Abstract: Sweetpotato weevils (Cylas spp.) are considered among the most destructive pests impacting sweetpotato production, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Traditional methods for assessing weevil damage, predominantly relying on manual scoring, are labour-intensive, subjective, and often yield inconsistent results. These challenges significantly hinder breeding programs aimed at developing resilient sweetpotato varieties. This study introduces a computer vision-based approach for the automated evaluation of weevil damage in both field and laboratory contexts. In the field settings, we collected data to train classification models to predict root-damage severity levels, achieving a test accuracy of 71.43%. Additionally, we established a laboratory dataset and designed an object detection pipeline employing YOLO12, a leading real-time detection model. This methodology incorporated a two-stage laboratory pipeline that combined root segmentation with a tiling strategy to improve the detectability of small objects. The resulting model demonstrated a mean average precision of 77.7% in identifying minute weevil feeding holes. Our findings indicate that computer vision technologies can provide efficient, objective, and scalable assessment tools that align seamlessly with contemporary breeding workflows. These advancements represent a significant improvement in enhancing phenotyping efficiency within sweetpotato breeding programs and play a crucial role in mitigating the detrimental effects of weevils on food security.

*Silpa Vadakkeeveetil Sreelatha,Dan Wang,Serge Belongie,Muhammad Awais,Anjan Dutta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAIGen is an unsupervised framework for discovering rare or minority attributes in diffusion models that are underrepresented in training data, going beyond predefined fairness categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current bias mitigation approaches either focus on predefined fairness categories (closed-set) or identify majority attributes (open-set), but both overlook the complementary task of discovering rare/minority features that are underrepresented in the data distribution yet still encoded in model representations.

Method: RAIGen uses Matryoshka Sparse Autoencoders and a novel minority metric that combines neuron activation frequency with semantic distinctiveness to identify interpretable neurons whose top-activating images reveal underrepresented attributes.

Result: RAIGen successfully discovers attributes beyond fixed fairness categories in Stable Diffusion, scales to larger models like SDXL, supports systematic auditing across architectures, and enables targeted amplification of rare attributes during generation.

Conclusion: RAIGen provides the first framework for unsupervised rare-attribute discovery in diffusion models, addressing a gap in current bias mitigation approaches by uncovering underrepresented features that are socially, culturally, or stylistically significant.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models achieve impressive generation quality but inherit and amplify training-data biases, skewing coverage of semantic attributes. Prior work addresses this in two ways. Closed-set approaches mitigate biases in predefined fairness categories (e.g., gender, race), assuming socially salient minority attributes are known a priori. Open-set approaches frame the task as bias identification, highlighting majority attributes that dominate outputs. Both overlook a complementary task: uncovering rare or minority features underrepresented in the data distribution (social, cultural, or stylistic) yet still encoded in model representations. We introduce RAIGen, the first framework, to our knowledge, for un-supervised rare-attribute discovery in diffusion models. RAIGen leverages Matryoshka Sparse Autoencoders and a novel minority metric combining neuron activation frequency with semantic distinctiveness to identify interpretable neurons whose top-activating images reveal underrepresented attributes. Experiments show RAIGen discovers attributes beyond fixed fairness categories in Stable Diffusion, scales to larger models such as SDXL, supports systematic auditing across architectures, and enables targeted amplification of rare attributes during generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaussianPOP: A principled 3D Gaussian Splatting simplification framework using analytical error quantification for optimal trade-off between model compactness and rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian simplification methods use importance scores not driven by visual error metrics, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between compactness and rendering fidelity.

Method: Novel error criterion derived from 3DGS rendering equation to measure each Gaussian's contribution to rendered image, with efficient single-forward-pass algorithm for practical error calculation. Supports both on-training pruning and post-training simplification via iterative error re-quantification.

Result: Consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art pruning methods across both application scenarios, achieving superior trade-off between model compactness and high rendering quality.

Conclusion: GaussianPOP provides an accurate and flexible framework for 3D Gaussian simplification that maintains rendering fidelity while achieving model compactness through principled error quantification.

Abstract: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting simplification methods commonly use importance scores, such as blending weights or sensitivity, to identify redundant Gaussians. However, these scores are not driven by visual error metrics, often leading to suboptimal trade-offs between compactness and rendering fidelity. We present GaussianPOP, a principled simplification framework based on analytical Gaussian error quantification. Our key contribution is a novel error criterion, derived directly from the 3DGS rendering equation, that precisely measures each Gaussian's contribution to the rendered image. By introducing a highly efficient algorithm, our framework enables practical error calculation in a single forward pass. The framework is both accurate and flexible, supporting on-training pruning as well as post-training simplification via iterative error re-quantification for improved stability. Experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art pruning methods across both application scenarios, achieving a superior trade-off between model compactness and high rendering quality.

*Meng Lou,Stanley Yu,Yizhou Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaRoute is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method using MoE architecture with shared expert centers and dynamic parameter routing for dense vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PEFT methods for dense prediction tasks have limitations: input-agnostic modeling and redundant cross-layer representations, failing to achieve full fine-tuning performance with minimal parameters.

Method: AdaRoute uses Mixture-of-Experts architecture with shared expert centers. Each expert is a trainable parameter matrix, and AdaRoute modules dynamically generate weight matrices via parameter routing that selectively aggregates experts based on input, enabling input-dependent low-rank adaptation.

Result: Extensive experiments show AdaRoute's superiority on diverse vision tasks including semantic segmentation, object detection, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation.

Conclusion: AdaRoute effectively addresses limitations of existing PEFT methods by enabling input-dependent adaptation and cross-layer feature interaction through shared expert centers and dynamic routing, achieving strong performance on complex dense prediction tasks.

Abstract: Adapting pre-trained vision models using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) remains challenging, as it aims to achieve performance comparable to full fine-tuning using a minimal number of trainable parameters. When applied to complex dense prediction tasks, existing methods exhibit limitations, including input-agnostic modeling and redundant cross-layer representations. To this end, we propose AdaRoute, a new adapter-style method featuring a simple mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture. Specifically, we introduce shared expert centers, where each expert is a trainable parameter matrix. During a feedforward pass, each AdaRoute module in the network dynamically generates weight matrices tailored for the current module via a simple dynamic parameter routing mechanism, which selectively aggregates parameter matrices in the corresponding expert center. Dynamic weight matrices in AdaRoute modules facilitate low-rank adaptation in an input-dependent manner, thus generating more customized and powerful feature representations. Moreover, since AdaRoute modules across multiple network layers share the same expert center, they improve feature diversity by promoting implicit cross-layer feature interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of AdaRoute on diverse vision tasks, including semantic segmentation, object detection and instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation.

TL;DR: RFDM is a causal, efficient video editing model that edits variable-length videos frame-by-frame using residual flow diffusion, matching image model compute while scaling independently of video length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video editing methods require fixed-length inputs and substantial compute, while autoregressive video generation remains under-explored for editing. There's a need for efficient, variable-length video editing with natural language control.

Method: Adapts 2D image-to-image diffusion to video-to-video editing by conditioning edits at time t on predictions at t-1. Introduces Residual Flow Diffusion Model (RFDM) with a new forward process that predicts residuals between target output and previous prediction, focusing denoising on changes between frames.

Result: RFDM surpasses I2I-based methods and competes with fully spatiotemporal 3D V2V models, while matching image model compute efficiency and scaling independently of input video length.

Conclusion: RFDM enables efficient, variable-length video editing with natural language control, bridging the gap between autoregressive generation and video editing while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Instructional video editing applies edits to an input video using only text prompts, enabling intuitive natural-language control. Despite rapid progress, most methods still require fixed-length inputs and substantial compute. Meanwhile, autoregressive video generation enables efficient variable-length synthesis, yet remains under-explored for video editing. We introduce a causal, efficient video editing model that edits variable-length videos frame by frame. For efficiency, we start from a 2D image-to-image (I2I) diffusion model and adapt it to video-to-video (V2V) editing by conditioning the edit at time step t on the model's prediction at t-1. To leverage videos' temporal redundancy, we propose a new I2I diffusion forward process formulation that encourages the model to predict the residual between the target output and the previous prediction. We call this Residual Flow Diffusion Model (RFDM), which focuses the denoising process on changes between consecutive frames. Moreover, we propose a new benchmark that better ranks state-of-the-art methods for editing tasks. Trained on paired video data for global/local style transfer and object removal, RFDM surpasses I2I-based methods and competes with fully spatiotemporal (3D) V2V models, while matching the compute of image models and scaling independently of input video length.

### [75] [Prompt Reinjection: Alleviating Prompt Forgetting in Multimodal Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06886)
*Yuxuan Yao,Yuxuan Chen,Hui Li,Kaihui Cheng,Qipeng Guo,Yuwei Sun,Zilong Dong,Jingdong Wang,Siyu Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies "prompt forgetting" in multimodal diffusion transformers where text prompt semantics degrade through network layers, and proposes a training-free "prompt reinjection" method to improve text-to-image generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors observed that in multimodal diffusion transformers (MMDiTs) like SD3, SD3.5, and FLUX.1, the semantic information from text prompts gets progressively forgotten as the network depth increases, which negatively impacts text-to-image generation quality.

Method: The paper introduces a training-free "prompt reinjection" approach that reinjects prompt representations from early layers into later layers to counteract the forgetting phenomenon, without requiring additional training.

Result: Experiments on GenEval, DPG, and T2I-CompBench++ show consistent improvements in instruction-following capability, along with better performance on preference, aesthetics, and overall text-image generation quality metrics.

Conclusion: Prompt forgetting is a significant issue in MMDiTs that affects text-to-image generation, and the proposed prompt reinjection method effectively mitigates this problem, leading to improved generation quality across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiTs) for text-to-image generation maintain separate text and image branches, with bidirectional information flow between text tokens and visual latents throughout denoising. In this setting, we observe a prompt forgetting phenomenon: the semantics of the prompt representation in the text branch is progressively forgotten as depth increases. We further verify this effect on three representative MMDiTs--SD3, SD3.5, and FLUX.1 by probing linguistic attributes of the representations over the layers in the text branch. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a training-free approach, prompt reinjection, which reinjects prompt representations from early layers into later layers to alleviate this forgetting. Experiments on GenEval, DPG, and T2I-CompBench++ show consistent gains in instruction-following capability, along with improvements on metrics capturing preference, aesthetics, and overall text--image generation quality.

### [76] [Seeing Beyond Redundancy: Task Complexity's Role in Vision Token Specialization in VLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06914)
*Darryl Hannan,John Cooper,Dylan White,Yijing Watkins*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLLMs struggle with fine-grained visual tasks due to visual redundancy where specific details are discarded; this paper investigates how different visual information is processed and finds task complexity affects visual compression, suggesting high-complexity data is key for improving VLLM visual capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision capabilities in VLLMs lag behind linguistic capabilities, especially for fine-grained visual information and spatial reasoning tasks. While visual redundancy has been proposed as an explanation (where fine-grained details are discarded), the exact mechanisms of how different visual information is processed and what gets discarded remain poorly understood.

Method: 1) Introduces a synthetic benchmark dataset specifically constructed to probe various visual features, 2) Develops metrics for measuring visual redundancy, 3) Explores fine-tuning VLLMs on complex visual tasks to study how redundancy and compression change based on training data complexity.

Result: Finds a connection between task complexity and visual compression - having sufficient high-complexity visual data is crucial for altering how VLLMs distribute their visual representations, which consequently improves performance on complex visual tasks.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into visual information processing in VLLMs, showing that task complexity affects visual compression patterns. This suggests that training with appropriate ratios of high-complexity visual data can improve VLLM performance on fine-grained visual tasks, offering valuable guidance for next-generation VLLM development.

Abstract: Vision capabilities in vision large language models (VLLMs) have consistently lagged behind their linguistic capabilities. In particular, numerous benchmark studies have demonstrated that VLLMs struggle when fine-grained visual information or spatial reasoning is required. However, we do not yet understand exactly why VLLMs struggle so much with these tasks relative to others. Some works have focused on visual redundancy as an explanation, where high-level visual information is uniformly spread across numerous tokens and specific, fine-grained visual information is discarded. In this work, we investigate this premise in greater detail, seeking to better understand exactly how various types of visual information are processed by the model and what types of visual information are discarded. To do so, we introduce a simple synthetic benchmark dataset that is specifically constructed to probe various visual features, along with a set of metrics for measuring visual redundancy, allowing us to better understand the nuances of their relationship. Then, we explore fine-tuning VLLMs on a number of complex visual tasks to better understand how redundancy and compression change based upon the complexity of the data that a model is trained on. We find that there is a connection between task complexity and visual compression, implying that having a sufficient ratio of high complexity visual data is crucial for altering the way that VLLMs distribute their visual representation and consequently improving their performance on complex visual tasks. We hope that this work will provide valuable insights for training the next generation of VLLMs.

TL;DR: Framework for detecting mislabeled samples in medical imaging datasets, validated on video capsule endoscopy data with expert re-annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging datasets are difficult to obtain due to limited specialized annotators and ambiguous class boundaries, leading to labeling errors that degrade classification performance.

Method: Proposed framework for mislabel detection in medical datasets, validated on two largest publicly available video capsule endoscopy datasets, with expert review of identified mislabeled samples.

Result: Framework successfully detects incorrectly labeled data and improves anomaly detection performance after dataset cleaning compared to current baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed mislabel detection framework effectively identifies labeling errors in medical datasets, leading to improved model performance through data quality enhancement.

Abstract: The classification performance of deep neural networks relies strongly on access to large, accurately annotated datasets. In medical imaging, however, obtaining such datasets is particularly challenging since annotations must be provided by specialized physicians, which severely limits the pool of annotators. Furthermore, class boundaries can often be ambiguous or difficult to define which further complicates machine learning-based classification. In this paper, we want to address this problem and introduce a framework for mislabel detection in medical datasets. This is validated on the two largest, publicly available datasets for Video Capsule Endoscopy, an important imaging procedure for examining the gastrointestinal tract based on a video stream of lowresolution images. In addition, potentially mislabeled samples identified by our pipeline were reviewed and re-annotated by three experienced gastroenterologists. Our results show that the proposed framework successfully detects incorrectly labeled data and results in an improved anomaly detection performance after cleaning the datasets compared to current baselines.

TL;DR: CineScene generates cinematic videos with dynamic subjects in static 3D scenes using implicit scene representations and camera control, trained on synthetic UE5 data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Live-action cinematic video production is expensive due to physical set construction. The paper aims to enable cost-effective generation of cinematic videos with dynamic subjects in consistent 3D scenes using only static scene images and user-specified camera trajectories.

Method: CineScene uses implicit 3D-aware scene representations with VGGT encoding of scene images, injecting spatial priors into a pretrained text-to-video model via context concatenation. Includes random-shuffling training strategy and uses Unreal Engine 5 synthetic dataset with paired videos (with/without subjects), panoramic images, and camera trajectories.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in scene-consistent cinematic video generation, handles large camera movements, and demonstrates generalization across diverse environments.

Conclusion: CineScene successfully addresses cinematic video generation with decoupled scene context, enabling camera-controlled synthesis with consistent scenes and dynamic subjects using only static scene images, reducing production costs.

Abstract: Cinematic video production requires control over scene-subject composition and camera movement, but live-action shooting remains costly due to the need for constructing physical sets. To address this, we introduce the task of cinematic video generation with decoupled scene context: given multiple images of a static environment, the goal is to synthesize high-quality videos featuring dynamic subject while preserving the underlying scene consistency and following a user-specified camera trajectory. We present CineScene, a framework that leverages implicit 3D-aware scene representation for cinematic video generation. Our key innovation is a novel context conditioning mechanism that injects 3D-aware features in an implicit way: By encoding scene images into visual representations through VGGT, CineScene injects spatial priors into a pretrained text-to-video generation model by additional context concatenation, enabling camera-controlled video synthesis with consistent scenes and dynamic subjects. To further enhance the model's robustness, we introduce a simple yet effective random-shuffling strategy for the input scene images during training. To address the lack of training data, we construct a scene-decoupled dataset with Unreal Engine 5, containing paired videos of scenes with and without dynamic subjects, panoramic images representing the underlying static scene, along with their camera trajectories. Experiments show that CineScene achieves state-of-the-art performance in scene-consistent cinematic video generation, handling large camera movements and demonstrating generalization across diverse environments.

TL;DR: MedMO is a medical multimodal LLM trained on domain-specific data with multi-stage training (cross-modal pretraining, instruction tuning, RL) that outperforms existing medical MLLMs across VQA, text QA, report generation, and disease localization tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs have limited adoption in medicine due to gaps in domain coverage, modality alignment, and grounded reasoning capabilities.

Method: Three-stage training: (1) cross-modal pretraining to align visual encoders with medical language backbone, (2) instruction tuning on multi-task supervision (captioning, VQA, report generation, retrieval, disease localization), (3) reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards combining factuality checks and box-level GIoU reward.

Result: Outperforms open-source medical MLLMs: +13.7% average accuracy on VQA benchmarks, +6.9% on text QA, significant gains in report generation, +40.4 IoU improvement for grounding. Shows strong cross-modality generalization across radiology, ophthalmology, and pathology.

Conclusion: MedMO demonstrates superior performance across multiple medical modalities and tasks, with robust spatial reasoning and localization capabilities, advancing medical MLLMs through domain-specific training and verifiable reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have rapidly advanced, yet their adoption in medicine remains limited by gaps in domain coverage, modality alignment, and grounded reasoning. In this work, we introduce MedMO, a medical foundation model built upon a generalized MLLM architecture and trained exclusively on large-scale, domain-specific data. MedMO follows a multi-stage training recipe: (i) cross-modal pretraining to align heterogeneous visual encoders with a medical language backbone; (ii) instruction tuning on multi-task supervision that spans captioning, VQA, report generation, retrieval, and grounded disease localization with bounding boxes; and (iii) reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards that combine factuality checks with a box-level GIoU reward to strengthen spatial grounding and step-by-step reasoning in complex clinical scenarios. MedMO consistently outperforms strong open-source medical MLLMs across multiple modalities and tasks. On VQA benchmarks, MedMO achieves an average accuracy improvement of +13.7% over the baseline and performs within 1.9% of the SOTA Fleming-VL. For text-based QA, it attains +6.9% over the baseline and +14.5% over Fleming-VL. In medical report generation, MedMO delivers significant gains in both semantic and clinical accuracy. Moreover, it exhibits strong grounding capability, achieving an IoU improvement of +40.4 over the baseline and +37.0% over Fleming-VL, underscoring its robust spatial reasoning and localization performance. Evaluations across radiology, ophthalmology, and pathology-microscopy confirm MedMO's broad cross-modality generalization. We release two versions of MedMO: 4B and 8B.

*Zhuoming Chen,Hongyi Liu,Yang Zhou,Haizhong Zheng,Beidi Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Jackpot uses Optimal Budget Rejection Sampling to reduce distribution mismatch when decoupling rollout generation from policy optimization in RL for LLMs, improving training stability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL for LLMs is expensive due to costly rollouts. Decoupling rollout generation from policy optimization could improve efficiency, but causes distribution mismatch that destabilizes learning.

Method: Proposes Jackpot framework with Optimal Budget Rejection Sampling (OBRS) to reduce discrepancy between rollout model and evolving policy. Includes unified training objective, top-k probability estimation, and batch-level bias correction.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows OBRS consistently moves rollout distribution closer to target distribution. Empirically improves training stability vs importance-sampling baselines, achieving performance comparable to on-policy RL for Qwen3-8B-Base.

Conclusion: OBRS-based alignment brings us closer to practical decoupling of rollout generation from policy optimization for RL in LLMs, enabling more efficient training.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) remains expensive, particularly because the rollout is expensive. Decoupling rollout generation from policy optimization (e.g., leveraging a more efficient model to rollout) could enable substantial efficiency gains, yet doing so introduces a severe distribution mismatch that destabilizes learning. We propose Jackpot, a framework that leverages Optimal Budget Rejection Sampling (OBRS) to directly reduce the discrepancy between the rollout model and the evolving policy. Jackpot integrates a principled OBRS procedure, a unified training objective that jointly updates the policy and rollout models, and an efficient system implementation enabled by top-$k$ probability estimation and batch-level bias correction. Our theoretical analysis shows that OBRS consistently moves the rollout distribution closer to the target distribution under a controllable acceptance budget. Empirically, \sys substantially improves training stability compared to importance-sampling baselines, achieving performance comparable to on-policy RL when training Qwen3-8B-Base for up to 300 update steps of batchsize 64. Taken together, our results show that OBRS-based alignment brings us a step closer to practical and effective decoupling of rollout generation from policy optimization for RL for LLMs.

TL;DR: Comprehensive survey categorizing reasoning failures in LLMs, distinguishing embodied vs. non-embodied reasoning and classifying failures into fundamental, application-specific, and robustness issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite LLMs' impressive reasoning capabilities, significant reasoning failures persist even in simple scenarios. There's a need to systematically understand and address these shortcomings through a unified framework.

Method: Introduces a novel categorization framework: distinguishes reasoning into embodied and non-embodied types (with non-embodied further divided into informal/intuitive and formal/logical reasoning). Classifies reasoning failures into three types: fundamental failures intrinsic to LLM architectures, application-specific limitations in particular domains, and robustness issues with inconsistent performance across minor variations.

Result: Provides a structured survey that unifies fragmented research efforts on LLM reasoning failures, offering clear definitions, analysis of existing studies, exploration of root causes, and presentation of mitigation strategies for each failure type.

Conclusion: The survey provides valuable insights into systemic weaknesses in LLM reasoning and guides future research toward building stronger, more reliable, and robust reasoning capabilities. The authors also release a comprehensive GitHub repository of research works on LLM reasoning failures.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable reasoning capabilities, achieving impressive results across a wide range of tasks. Despite these advances, significant reasoning failures persist, occurring even in seemingly simple scenarios. To systematically understand and address these shortcomings, we present the first comprehensive survey dedicated to reasoning failures in LLMs. We introduce a novel categorization framework that distinguishes reasoning into embodied and non-embodied types, with the latter further subdivided into informal (intuitive) and formal (logical) reasoning. In parallel, we classify reasoning failures along a complementary axis into three types: fundamental failures intrinsic to LLM architectures that broadly affect downstream tasks; application-specific limitations that manifest in particular domains; and robustness issues characterized by inconsistent performance across minor variations. For each reasoning failure, we provide a clear definition, analyze existing studies, explore root causes, and present mitigation strategies. By unifying fragmented research efforts, our survey provides a structured perspective on systemic weaknesses in LLM reasoning, offering valuable insights and guiding future research towards building stronger, more reliable, and robust reasoning capabilities. We additionally release a comprehensive collection of research works on LLM reasoning failures, as a GitHub repository at https://github.com/Peiyang-Song/Awesome-LLM-Reasoning-Failures, to provide an easy entry point to this area.

### [82] [Do It for HER: First-Order Temporal Logic Reward Specification in Reinforcement Learning (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06227)
*Pierriccardo Olivieri,Fausto Lasca,Alessandro Gianola,Matteo Papini*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes LTLfMT framework for specifying non-Markovian rewards in MDPs with large state spaces, using first-order logic theories for complex task specification over unstructured data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for expressive logical specification of complex tasks in MDPs with large state spaces, avoiding manual predicate encoding and enabling unified framework for heterogeneous data domains.

Method: Uses Linear Temporal Logic Modulo Theories over finite traces (LTLfMT) with first-order formulas, identifies tractable fragment, implements reward machines with Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) to handle reward sparsity.

Result: Framework enables natural specification of complex tasks in continuous-control settings using Non-Linear Arithmetic Theory, with tailored HER implementation proving fundamental for solving tasks with complex goals.

Conclusion: LTLfMT provides expressive yet tractable framework for non-Markovian reward specification in large state spaces, with HER-based approach effectively addressing computational challenges and reward sparsity.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework for the logical specification of non-Markovian rewards in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with large state spaces. Our approach leverages Linear Temporal Logic Modulo Theories over finite traces (LTLfMT), a more expressive extension of classical temporal logic in which predicates are first-order formulas of arbitrary first-order theories rather than simple Boolean variables. This enhanced expressiveness enables the specification of complex tasks over unstructured and heterogeneous data domains, promoting a unified and reusable framework that eliminates the need for manual predicate encoding. However, the increased expressive power of LTLfMT introduces additional theoretical and computational challenges compared to standard LTLf specifications. We address these challenges from a theoretical standpoint, identifying a fragment of LTLfMT that is tractable but sufficiently expressive for reward specification in an infinite-state-space context. From a practical perspective, we introduce a method based on reward machines and Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) to translate first-order logic specifications and address reward sparsity. We evaluate this approach to a continuous-control setting using Non-Linear Arithmetic Theory, showing that it enables natural specification of complex tasks. Experimental results show how a tailored implementation of HER is fundamental in solving tasks with complex goals.

### [83] [Do LLMs Act Like Rational Agents? Measuring Belief Coherence in Probabilistic Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06286)
*Khurram Yamin,Jingjing Tang,Santiago Cortes-Gomez,Amit Sharma,Eric Horvitz,Bryan Wilder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs may not act as rational utility maximizers with coherent beliefs in high-stakes decision-making, raising concerns about their reliability for critical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used as agents in high-stakes domains where optimal actions depend on uncertainty and outcome utilities, but their decision logic remains difficult to interpret. There's a need to understand whether LLMs behave as rational utility maximizers with coherent beliefs and stable preferences.

Method: The researchers study LLM behaviors using diagnosis challenge problems. They develop an approach that provides falsifiable conditions to test whether reported probabilities can correspond to true beliefs of any rational agent. This methodology is applied to multiple medical diagnostic domains across several LLMs.

Result: The results provide insights about the relationship between LLM inferences and ideal Bayesian utility maximization for elicited probabilities and observed actions. The approach identifies conditions where reported probabilities cannot correspond to true beliefs of any rational agent.

Conclusion: The findings have important implications for using LLMs in guiding high-stakes decisions, suggesting that current LLMs may not reliably act as rational utility maximizers with coherent beliefs, necessitating further research and development for safe deployment in critical applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in high-stakes domains where optimal actions depend on both uncertainty about the world and consideration of utilities of different outcomes, yet their decision logic remains difficult to interpret. We study whether LLMs are rational utility maximizers with coherent beliefs and stable preferences. We consider behaviors of models for diagnosis challenge problems. The results provide insights about the relationship of LLM inferences to ideal Bayesian utility maximization for elicited probabilities and observed actions. Our approach provides falsifiable conditions under which the reported probabilities \emph{cannot} correspond to the true beliefs of any rational agent. We apply this methodology to multiple medical diagnostic domains with evaluations across several LLMs. We discuss implications of the results and directions forward for uses of LLMs in guiding high-stakes decisions.

*Qifan Zhang,Jianhao Ruan,Aochuan Chen,Kang Zeng,Nuo Chen,Jing Tang,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GrAlgoBench is a new benchmark using graph algorithm problems to evaluate Large Reasoning Models, revealing their poor performance on long-context reasoning and over-thinking issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for Large Reasoning Models are limited - they lack long-context evaluation, aren't challenging enough, and have answers that are hard to verify programmatically. Graph algorithm problems are ideal for testing reasoning abilities because they require long-context reasoning, allow difficulty control, and enable standardized evaluation.

Method: Created GrAlgoBench benchmark with nine graph algorithm tasks. These problems demand long-context reasoning and allow systematic evaluation of LRMs' capabilities. The benchmark enables programmatic verification of answers and fine-grained difficulty control.

Result: Two major weaknesses discovered: 1) Accuracy drops sharply with longer contexts (below 50% for graphs over 120 nodes) due to execution errors, weak memory, and redundant reasoning. 2) Over-thinking phenomenon where extensive self-verification inflates reasoning traces without improving correctness.

Conclusion: GrAlgoBench establishes graph algorithm problems as a rigorous, multidimensional testbed for advancing reasoning in LRMs, exposing critical limitations in long-context reasoning and inefficient verification processes.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have advanced rapidly; however, existing benchmarks in mathematics, code, and common-sense reasoning remain limited. They lack long-context evaluation, offer insufficient challenge, and provide answers that are difficult to verify programmatically. We introduce GrAlgoBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LRMs through graph algorithm problems. Such problems are particularly well suited for probing reasoning abilities: they demand long-context reasoning, allow fine-grained control of difficulty levels, and enable standardized, programmatic evaluation. Across nine tasks, our systematic experiments reveal two major weaknesses of current LRMs. First, accuracy deteriorates sharply as context length increases, falling below 50% once graphs exceed 120 nodes. This degradation is driven by frequent execution errors, weak memory, and redundant reasoning. Second, LRMs suffer from an over-thinking phenomenon, primarily caused by extensive yet largely ineffective self-verification, which inflates reasoning traces without improving correctness. By exposing these limitations, GrAlgoBench establishes graph algorithm problems as a rigorous, multidimensional, and practically relevant testbed for advancing the study of reasoning in LRMs. Code is available at https://github.com/Bklight999/GrAlgoBench.

### [85] [Trifuse: Enhancing Attention-Based GUI Grounding via Multimodal Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06351)
*Longhui Ma,Di Zhao,Siwei Wang,Zhao Lv,Miao Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Trifuse is an attention-based GUI grounding framework that integrates attention mechanisms, OCR text, and icon captions via Consensus-SinglePeak fusion, achieving strong performance without task-specific fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI grounding approaches either require expensive fine-tuning on large datasets (poor generalization) or use attention-based methods that lack explicit spatial anchors, leading to low reliability. There's a need for a method that combines the benefits of attention mechanisms with explicit spatial cues without requiring task-specific training.

Method: Trifuse integrates three complementary modalities: 1) attention mechanisms from MLLMs, 2) OCR-derived textual cues, and 3) icon-level caption semantics. These are fused using a Consensus-SinglePeak (CS) strategy that enforces cross-modal agreement while maintaining sharp localization peaks, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning.

Result: Extensive evaluations on four grounding benchmarks show Trifuse achieves strong performance without task-specific fine-tuning. Ablation studies confirm that incorporating OCR and caption cues consistently improves attention-based grounding across different backbones, substantially reducing reliance on expensive annotated data.

Conclusion: Trifuse provides an effective general framework for GUI grounding that successfully integrates complementary spatial anchors through multi-modal fusion, addressing limitations of both fine-tuning-based and pure attention-based approaches while maintaining strong performance without expensive data annotation.

Abstract: GUI grounding maps natural language instructions to the correct interface elements, serving as the perception foundation for GUI agents. Existing approaches predominantly rely on fine-tuning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) using large-scale GUI datasets to predict target element coordinates, which is data-intensive and generalizes poorly to unseen interfaces. Recent attention-based alternatives exploit localization signals in MLLMs attention mechanisms without task-specific fine-tuning, but suffer from low reliability due to the lack of explicit and complementary spatial anchors in GUI images. To address this limitation, we propose Trifuse, an attention-based grounding framework that explicitly integrates complementary spatial anchors. Trifuse integrates attention, OCR-derived textual cues, and icon-level caption semantics via a Consensus-SinglePeak (CS) fusion strategy that enforces cross-modal agreement while retaining sharp localization peaks. Extensive evaluations on four grounding benchmarks demonstrate that Trifuse achieves strong performance without task-specific fine-tuning, substantially reducing the reliance on expensive annotated data. Moreover, ablation studies reveal that incorporating OCR and caption cues consistently improves attention-based grounding performance across different backbones, highlighting its effectiveness as a general framework for GUI grounding.

*Yu Zhao,Fan Jiang,Tianle Liu,Bo Zeng,Yu Liu,Longyue Wang,Weihua Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DEPO reduces rollout costs 2x by filtering training data with difficulty estimation before rollouts, solving GRPO's gradient attenuation and computational inefficiency problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO suffers from gradient signal attenuation on trivial/overly complex problems and computational inefficiency from exhaustive rollouts on low-utility samples, creating convergence stability issues and high training costs.

Method: Difficulty-Estimated Policy Optimization (DEPO) integrates an online Difficulty Estimator that dynamically assesses and filters training data before rollout phase, prioritizing computational resources for samples with high learning potential.

Result: DEPO achieves up to 2x reduction in rollout costs without compromising model performance, significantly lowering computational barrier for training high-performance reasoning models.

Conclusion: DEPO offers a more sustainable path for reasoning scaling by optimizing efficiency and robustness of reasoning alignment through intelligent data filtering before rollouts.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), exemplified by DeepSeek-R1, have underscored the potential of scaling inference-time compute through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). However, GRPO frequently suffers from gradient signal attenuation when encountering problems that are either too trivial or overly complex. In these scenarios, the disappearance of inter-group advantages makes the gradient signal susceptible to noise, thereby jeopardizing convergence stability. While variants like DAPO attempt to rectify gradient vanishing, they do not alleviate the substantial computational overhead incurred by exhaustive rollouts on low-utility samples. In this paper, we propose Difficulty-Estimated Policy Optimization (DEPO), a novel framework designed to optimize the efficiency and robustness of reasoning alignment. DEPO integrates an online Difficulty Estimator that dynamically assesses and filters training data before the rollout phase. This mechanism ensures that computational resources are prioritized for samples with high learning potential. Empirical results demonstrate that DEPO achieves up to a 2x reduction in rollout costs without compromising model performance. Our approach significantly lowers the computational barrier for training high-performance reasoning models, offering a more sustainable path for reasoning scaling. Code and data will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: QA-Token introduces quality-aware tokenization that incorporates data reliability into vocabulary construction, improving performance on noisy real-world data across genomics and finance domains with zero inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tokenization methods process sequential data without accounting for signal quality, limiting their effectiveness on noisy real-world corpora like genomic sequences and financial time series.

Method: Three key contributions: (1) bilevel optimization for joint vocabulary construction and downstream performance, (2) reinforcement learning with quality-aware rewards and convergence guarantees, (3) adaptive parameter learning via Gumbel-Softmax relaxation for end-to-end optimization.

Result: Consistent improvements across domains: genomics (6.7 percentage point F1 gain in variant calling), finance (30% Sharpe ratio improvement). At foundation scale: tokenized 1.7 trillion base-pairs, achieved state-of-the-art pathogen detection (94.53 MCC) while reducing token count by 15%.

Conclusion: QA-Token unlocks noisy real-world corpora (petabases of genomic sequences, terabytes of financial time series) for foundation model training with zero inference overhead, addressing the limitation of traditional tokenization methods.

Abstract: Current tokenization methods process sequential data without accounting for signal quality, limiting their effectiveness on noisy real-world corpora. We present QA-Token (Quality-Aware Tokenization), which incorporates data reliability directly into vocabulary construction. We make three key contributions: (i) a bilevel optimization formulation that jointly optimizes vocabulary construction and downstream performance, (ii) a reinforcement learning approach that learns merge policies through quality-aware rewards with convergence guarantees, and (iii) an adaptive parameter learning mechanism via Gumbel-Softmax relaxation for end-to-end optimization. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates consistent improvements: genomics (6.7 percentage point F1 gain in variant calling over BPE), finance (30% Sharpe ratio improvement). At foundation scale, we tokenize a pretraining corpus comprising 1.7 trillion base-pairs and achieve state-of-the-art pathogen detection (94.53 MCC) while reducing token count by 15%. We unlock noisy real-world corpora, spanning petabases of genomic sequences and terabytes of financial time series, for foundation model training with zero inference overhead.

### [88] [Intrinsic Stability Limits of Autoregressive Reasoning: Structural Consequences for Long-Horizon Execution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06413)
*Hsien-Jyh Liao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Autoregressive LLMs have intrinsic stability limits in long-horizon reasoning due to exponential decay of decision advantage, requiring structured governance like DAGs rather than just scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show sharp performance deterioration in long-horizon tasks, which conventional explanations attribute to task complexity. This paper argues these explanations are incomplete and proposes that autoregressive execution has intrinsic stability limits even in simple linear tasks.

Method: Proposes theoretical framework showing decision advantage decays exponentially with execution length (Theorem A), establishing fundamental bound on maintainable reasoning chains. Empirical studies in synthetic environments and real TextWorld tasks validate theoretical predictions.

Result: Empirical studies reveal observable performance cliffs consistent with theoretical predictions. Shows that stable long-horizon reasoning requires discrete segmentation, naturally inducing graph-like execution structures like DAGs.

Conclusion: Long-horizon reasoning failure stems from process-level instability in autoregressive generation, not just task complexity. Short-horizon evaluation may obscure structural instability, suggesting future reasoning systems need structured governance rather than just scaling.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning capabilities, yet their performance often deteriorates sharply in long-horizon tasks, exhibiting systematic breakdown beyond certain scales. Conventional explanations primarily attribute this phenomenon to task complexity, such as combinatorial search explosion or long-term credit assignment challenges. In this work, we argue that these explanations are incomplete: even in linear, unbranched tasks without semantic ambiguity, autoregressive execution is subject to an intrinsic stability limit.
  We propose that the fundamental constraint on long-horizon reasoning arises from process-level instability in autoregressive generation rather than solely from search or task complexity, reframing long-horizon reasoning as a problem of structural governance. We derive Theorem~A, showing that decision advantage in single-path autoregressive reasoning decays exponentially with execution length, imposing a fundamental bound on maintainable reasoning chains. This result implies a structural consequence: stable long-horizon reasoning requires discrete segmentation, naturally inducing graph-like execution structures such as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).
  Empirical studies in both synthetic environments and real TextWorld tasks reveal observable performance cliffs consistent with theoretical predictions. Our findings provide a dynamical perspective on long-horizon reasoning failure and suggest new limitations on maintaining long-term coherence under purely autoregressive architectures. Furthermore, we highlight that short-horizon evaluation protocols may obscure structural instability, indicating a potential shift from scaling toward structured governance in future reasoning systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A 4B-parameter edge-scale LLM agent (AgentCPM-Explore) achieves SOTA performance by addressing catastrophic forgetting, reward noise, and reasoning degradation through parameter fusion, reward denoising, and context refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based agents rely heavily on large-scale models, leaving edge-scale models (4B parameters) underexplored despite their potential for efficient deployment and reduced computational costs.

Method: Proposes AgentCPM-Explore with holistic training framework: parameter-space model fusion to prevent catastrophic forgetting during SFT, reward signal denoising for RL stability, and contextual information refinement to handle long-context reasoning degradation.

Result: Achieves SOTA among 4B-class models, matches/surpasses 8B-class SOTA models on four benchmarks, outperforms larger models (Claude-4.5-Sonnet, DeepSeek-v3.2) on five benchmarks, and achieves 97.09% accuracy on GAIA text tasks under pass@64.

Conclusion: Edge-scale models' bottleneck is inference stability, not inherent capability ceiling. The training framework effectively unlocks significant, previously underestimated potential of compact 4B models for agentic tasks.

Abstract: While Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown remarkable potential for solving complex tasks, existing systems remain heavily reliant on large-scale models, leaving the capabilities of edge-scale models largely underexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic study on training agentic models at the 4B-parameter scale. We identify three primary bottlenecks hindering the performance of edge-scale models: catastrophic forgetting during Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), sensitivity to reward signal noise during Reinforcement Learning (RL), and reasoning degradation caused by redundant information in long-context scenarios. To address the issues, we propose AgentCPM-Explore, a compact 4B agent model with high knowledge density and strong exploration capability. We introduce a holistic training framework featuring parameter-space model fusion, reward signal denoising, and contextual information refinement. Through deep exploration, AgentCPM-Explore achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among 4B-class models, matches or surpasses 8B-class SOTA models on four benchmarks, and even outperforms larger-scale models such as Claude-4.5-Sonnet or DeepSeek-v3.2 in five benchmarks. Notably, AgentCPM-Explore achieves 97.09% accuracy on GAIA text-based tasks under pass@64. These results provide compelling evidence that the bottleneck for edge-scale models is not their inherent capability ceiling, but rather their inference stability. Based on our well-established training framework, AgentCPM-Explore effectively unlocks the significant, yet previously underestimated, potential of edge-scale models.

TL;DR: JADE is a two-layer evaluation framework for agentic AI that combines stable evaluation skills with flexible claim-level assessment to address the rigor-flexibility dilemma in professional task evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for agentic AI face a fundamental dilemma: static rubrics provide rigor but lack flexibility for diverse valid responses, while LLM-as-a-judge approaches adapt to individual responses but suffer from instability and bias. Human experts combine domain principles with dynamic assessment, inspiring a better solution.

Method: JADE uses a two-layer framework: Layer 1 encodes expert knowledge as predefined evaluation skills for stable criteria; Layer 2 performs report-specific, claim-level evaluation to flexibly assess diverse reasoning strategies, with evidence-dependency gating to invalidate conclusions built on refuted claims.

Result: On BizBench, JADE improves evaluation stability and reveals critical agent failure modes missed by holistic LLM-based evaluators. It demonstrates strong alignment with expert-authored rubrics and effective transfer to a medical-domain benchmark, validating cross-domain applicability.

Conclusion: JADE successfully addresses the rigor-flexibility dilemma in agentic AI evaluation by combining stable evaluation skills with flexible claim-level assessment, enabling more reliable and insightful evaluation across professional domains.

Abstract: Evaluating agentic AI on open-ended professional tasks faces a fundamental dilemma between rigor and flexibility. Static rubrics provide rigorous, reproducible assessment but fail to accommodate diverse valid response strategies, while LLM-as-a-judge approaches adapt to individual responses yet suffer from instability and bias. Human experts address this dilemma by combining domain-grounded principles with dynamic, claim-level assessment. Inspired by this process, we propose JADE, a two-layer evaluation framework. Layer 1 encodes expert knowledge as a predefined set of evaluation skills, providing stable evaluation criteria. Layer 2 performs report-specific, claim-level evaluation to flexibly assess diverse reasoning strategies, with evidence-dependency gating to invalidate conclusions built on refuted claims. Experiments on BizBench show that JADE improves evaluation stability and reveals critical agent failure modes missed by holistic LLM-based evaluators. We further demonstrate strong alignment with expert-authored rubrics and effective transfer to a medical-domain benchmark, validating JADE across professional domains.

*Finn Rietz,Mart Kartašev,Johannes A. Stork,Petter Ögren*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Combining Behavior Trees with Reinforcement Learning using progress constraints to prevent controllers from undoing previously achieved subgoals, improving performance and sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Behavior Trees provide structured decision-making but need optimal controllers, while RL can learn optimal controllers but struggles with sparse rewards and safe exploration. Combining them offers mutual benefits but naive integration causes controllers to counteract each other and undo subgoals.

Method: Proposed progress constraints mechanism where feasibility estimators constrain the allowed action set based on theoretical BT convergence results, preventing controllers from undoing previously achieved subgoals.

Result: Empirical evaluations in 2D proof-of-concept and high-fidelity warehouse environment demonstrate improved performance, sample efficiency, and constraint satisfaction compared to prior BT-RL integration methods.

Conclusion: Progress constraints effectively address the problem of controllers counteracting each other in BT-RL integration, leading to better overall performance while maintaining the structured benefits of Behavior Trees.

Abstract: Behavior Trees (BTs) provide a structured and reactive framework for decision-making, commonly used to switch between sub-controllers based on environmental conditions. Reinforcement Learning (RL), on the other hand, can learn near-optimal controllers but sometimes struggles with sparse rewards, safe exploration, and long-horizon credit assignment. Combining BTs with RL has the potential for mutual benefit: a BT design encodes structured domain knowledge that can simplify RL training, while RL enables automatic learning of the controllers within BTs. However, naive integration of BTs and RL can lead to some controllers counteracting other controllers, possibly undoing previously achieved subgoals, thereby degrading the overall performance. To address this, we propose progress constraints, a novel mechanism where feasibility estimators constrain the allowed action set based on theoretical BT convergence results. Empirical evaluations in a 2D proof-of-concept and a high-fidelity warehouse environment demonstrate improved performance, sample efficiency, and constraint satisfaction, compared to prior methods of BT-RL integration.

*Shengxuan Qiu,Haochen Huang,Shuzhang Zhong,Pengfei Zuo,Meng Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HyPER is a training-free online control policy for multi-path decoding in mixture-of-experts models that dynamically balances exploration-exploitation during test-time compute scaling, improving accuracy while reducing token usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to test-time compute scaling have rigid exploration-exploitation trade-offs: tree search uses brittle expansion rules that interfere with reasoning, while parallel reasoning over-explores redundant paths with weak answer selection. The optimal balance is phase-dependent, and correct/incorrect paths often diverge only at late stages.

Method: Reformulates test-time scaling as a dynamic expand-reduce control problem over hypothesis pools. HyPER includes: 1) online controller transitioning from exploration to exploitation as pool evolves, 2) token-level refinement for efficient generation-time exploitation without full-path resampling, and 3) length- and confidence-aware aggregation for reliable answer-time exploitation.

Result: Experiments on four mixture-of-experts language models across diverse reasoning benchmarks show HyPER consistently achieves superior accuracy-compute trade-off, improving accuracy by 8-10% while reducing token usage by 25-40%.

Conclusion: HyPER provides an effective training-free solution for dynamic exploration-exploitation control in multi-path decoding, enabling more efficient test-time compute scaling for reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute with multi-path chain-of-thought improves reasoning accuracy, but its effectiveness depends critically on the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Existing approaches address this trade-off in rigid ways: tree-structured search hard-codes exploration through brittle expansion rules that interfere with post-trained reasoning, while parallel reasoning over-explores redundant hypothesis paths and relies on weak answer selection. Motivated by the observation that the optimal balance is phase-dependent and that correct and incorrect reasoning paths often diverge only at late stages, we reformulate test-time scaling as a dynamic expand-reduce control problem over a pool of hypotheses. We propose HyPER, a training-free online control policy for multi-path decoding in mixture-of-experts models that reallocates computation under a fixed budget using lightweight path statistics. HyPER consists of an online controller that transitions from exploration to exploitation as the hypothesis pool evolves, a token-level refinement mechanism that enables efficient generation-time exploitation without full-path resampling, and a length- and confidence-aware aggregation strategy for reliable answer-time exploitation. Experiments on four mixture-of-experts language models across diverse reasoning benchmarks show that HyPER consistently achieves a superior accuracy-compute trade-off, improving accuracy by 8 to 10 percent while reducing token usage by 25 to 40 percent.

TL;DR: LogicSkills benchmark isolates three core logical reasoning skills in LLMs: formal symbolization, countermodel construction, and validity assessment, revealing models perform well on validity but poorly on symbolization and countermodel construction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs show strong performance on logical reasoning benchmarks, it's unclear which core logical skills they truly master. The authors aim to isolate and evaluate fundamental skills in formal reasoning beyond surface-level pattern recognition.

Method: Created LogicSkills benchmark with items from two-variable fragment of first-order logic (without identity), presented in both natural English and Carroll-style language with nonce words. All examples verified for correctness and non-triviality using SMT solver Z3.

Result: Leading models show high performance on validity assessment but substantially lower performance on formal symbolization and countermodel construction, indicating reliance on surface-level patterns rather than genuine symbolic or rule-based reasoning.

Conclusion: Current LLMs lack genuine mastery of core logical reasoning skills like formal symbolization and countermodel construction, suggesting they rely on surface-level patterns rather than true symbolic reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated notable performance across various logical reasoning benchmarks. However, it remains unclear which core logical skills they truly master. To address this, we introduce LogicSkills, a unified benchmark designed to isolate three fundamental skills in formal reasoning: (i) $\textit{formal symbolization}\unicode{x2014}$translating premises into first-order logic; (ii) $\textit{countermodel construction}\unicode{x2014}$formulating a finite structure in which all premises are true while the conclusion is false; and (iii) $\textit{validity assessment}\unicode{x2014}$deciding whether a conclusion follows from a given set of premises. Items are drawn from the two-variable fragment of first-order logic (without identity) and are presented in both natural English and a Carroll-style language with nonce words. All examples are verified for correctness and non-triviality using the SMT solver Z3. Across leading models, performance is high on validity but substantially lower on symbolization and countermodel construction, suggesting reliance on surface-level patterns rather than genuine symbolic or rule-based reasoning.

TL;DR: AgentCPM-Report is a lightweight 8B-parameter local research agent that uses a Writing As Reasoning Policy (WARP) to dynamically revise outlines during report generation, outperforming closed-source systems without privacy concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep research systems rely heavily on closed-source or online large models for outline construction, creating deployment barriers and raising safety/privacy concerns for user data. There's a need for lightweight local solutions that can perform deep research without these dependencies.

Method: Proposes AgentCPM-Report with Writing As Reasoning Policy (WARP) that enables dynamic outline revision during report generation. Uses Evidence-Based Drafting and Reasoning-Driven Deepening for information acquisition and knowledge refinement. Employs Multi-Stage Agentic Training: cold-start, atomic skill RL, and holistic pipeline RL to equip small models with these capabilities.

Result: Outperforms leading closed-source systems on DeepResearch Bench, DeepConsult, and DeepResearch Gym benchmarks, with substantial gains in Insight metrics.

Conclusion: AgentCPM-Report provides a high-performing local solution for deep research report generation that addresses privacy concerns while maintaining strong reasoning capabilities through its innovative WARP framework and training strategy.

Abstract: Generating deep research reports requires large-scale information acquisition and the synthesis of insight-driven analysis, posing a significant challenge for current language models. Most existing approaches follow a plan-then-write paradigm, whose performance heavily depends on the quality of the initial outline. However, constructing a comprehensive outline itself demands strong reasoning ability, causing current deep research systems to rely almost exclusively on closed-source or online large models. This reliance raises practical barriers to deployment and introduces safety and privacy concerns for user-authored data. In this work, we present AgentCPM-Report, a lightweight yet high-performing local solution composed of a framework that mirrors the human writing process and an 8B-parameter deep research agent. Our framework uses a Writing As Reasoning Policy (WARP), which enables models to dynamically revise outlines during report generation. Under this policy, the agent alternates between Evidence-Based Drafting and Reasoning-Driven Deepening, jointly supporting information acquisition, knowledge refinement, and iterative outline evolution. To effectively equip small models with this capability, we introduce a Multi-Stage Agentic Training strategy, consisting of cold-start, atomic skill RL, and holistic pipeline RL. Experiments on DeepResearch Bench, DeepConsult, and DeepResearch Gym demonstrate that AgentCPM-Report outperforms leading closed-source systems, with substantial gains in Insight.

*Tianyi Hu,Qingxu Fu,Yanxi Chen,Zhaoyang Liu,Bolin Ding*

TL;DR: SeeUPO is a critic-free RL algorithm with convergence guarantees for multi-turn LLM agents, achieving substantial performance gains over existing methods through sequential policy updates in reverse execution order.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL algorithms for LLM-based agents lack verified convergence guarantees in multi-turn settings, leading to training instability and failure to converge to optimal policies. Current methods cannot simultaneously achieve both critic-free operation and convergence guarantees.

Method: SeeUPO models multi-turn interactions as sequentially executed multi-agent bandit problems. It performs turn-by-turn sequential policy updates in reverse execution order, ensuring monotonic improvement and convergence to global optimal solution via backward induction.

Result: Experiments on AppWorld and BFCL v4 show SeeUPO achieves relative gains of 43.3%-54.6% on Qwen3-14B and 24.1%-41.9% on Qwen2.5-14B (averaged across benchmarks), with superior training stability compared to existing backbone algorithms.

Conclusion: SeeUPO successfully addresses the limitations of existing RL algorithms by providing a critic-free approach with convergence guarantees for multi-turn LLM agents, demonstrating substantial performance improvements and better training stability.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as the predominant paradigm for training large language model (LLM)-based AI agents. However, existing backbone RL algorithms lack verified convergence guarantees in agentic scenarios, especially in multi-turn settings, which can lead to training instability and failure to converge to optimal policies.
  In this paper, we systematically analyze how different combinations of policy update mechanisms and advantage estimation methods affect convergence properties in single/multi-turn scenarios. We find that REINFORCE with Group Relative Advantage Estimation (GRAE) can converge to the globally optimal under undiscounted conditions, but the combination of PPO & GRAE breaks PPO's original monotonic improvement property. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mainstream backbone RL algorithms cannot simultaneously achieve both critic-free and convergence guarantees in multi-turn scenarios.
  To address this, we propose SeeUPO (Sequence-level Sequential Update Policy Optimization), a critic-free approach with convergence guarantees for multi-turn interactions. SeeUPO models multi-turn interaction as sequentially executed multi-agent bandit problems. Through turn-by-turn sequential policy updates in reverse execution order, it ensures monotonic improvement and convergence to global optimal solution via backward induction.
  Experiments on AppWorld and BFCL v4 demonstrate SeeUPO's substantial improvements over existing backbone algorithms: relative gains of 43.3%-54.6% on Qwen3-14B and 24.1%-41.9% on Qwen2.5-14B (averaged across benchmarks), along with superior training stability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VLMs show output invariance but internal instability - models maintain predictions while representations drift significantly, especially with text overlays. Larger models are more accurate but equally or more sensitive. Perturbations affect tasks differently: harming reasoning but reducing hallucination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM robustness evaluation focuses on output-level invariance, assuming stable predictions indicate stable multimodal processing. This work argues this assumption is insufficient and proposes a more comprehensive evaluation framework.

Method: Introduces a representation-aware and frequency-aware evaluation framework measuring internal embedding drift, spectral sensitivity, and structural smoothness (spatial consistency of vision tokens), alongside standard label-based metrics. Applied to modern VLMs across SEEDBench, MMMU, and POPE datasets.

Result: Three distinct failure modes: 1) Models preserve predicted answers while undergoing substantial internal representation drift (approaching inter-image variability with text overlays), 2) Robustness doesn't improve with scale - larger models have higher accuracy but equal/greater sensitivity, 3) Perturbations affect tasks differently - harm reasoning when disrupting coarse/fine visual cue combination but reduce hallucination false positives.

Conclusion: Output-level invariance is insufficient for evaluating VLM robustness. Internal representation analysis reveals significant instability despite stable predictions, with scale not improving robustness and task-dependent perturbation effects.

Abstract: The robustness of Vision Language Models (VLMs) is commonly assessed through output-level invariance, implicitly assuming that stable predictions reflect stable multimodal processing. In this work, we argue that this assumption is insufficient. We introduce a representation-aware and frequency-aware evaluation framework that measures internal embedding drift, spectral sensitivity, and structural smoothness (spatial consistency of vision tokens), alongside standard label-based metrics. Applying this framework to modern VLMs across the SEEDBench, MMMU, and POPE datasets reveals three distinct failure modes. First, models frequently preserve predicted answers while undergoing substantial internal representation drift; for perturbations such as text overlays, this drift approaches the magnitude of inter-image variability, indicating that representations move to regions typically occupied by unrelated inputs despite unchanged outputs. Second, robustness does not improve with scale; larger models achieve higher accuracy but exhibit equal or greater sensitivity, consistent with sharper yet more fragile decision boundaries. Third, we find that perturbations affect tasks differently: they harm reasoning when they disrupt how models combine coarse and fine visual cues, but on the hallucination benchmarks, they can reduce false positives by making models generate more conservative answers.

*Thiviyan Thanapalasingam,Antonis Vozikis,Peter Bloem,Paul Groth*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARK is an autoregressive model family for generating semantically valid knowledge graphs by treating graphs as sequences of triples, achieving 89.2-100% validity on IntelliGraphs benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge graph generation requires capturing complex semantic dependencies and domain constraints, unlike link prediction which scores triples independently. Current approaches need to learn interdependencies across entire subgraphs to produce coherent structures.

Method: ARK treats knowledge graphs as sequences of (head, relation, tail) triples using autoregressive models. It learns implicit semantic constraints (type consistency, temporal validity, relational patterns) directly from data without explicit rule supervision. Also introduces SAIL, a variational extension for controlled generation via learned latent representations.

Result: Achieves 89.2% to 100.0% semantic validity across diverse datasets on IntelliGraphs benchmark while generating novel graphs not seen during training. Model capacity (hidden dimensionality ≥ 64) is more critical than architectural depth, with recurrent architectures achieving comparable validity to transformers with better computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Autoregressive models provide an effective framework for KG generation with practical applications in knowledge base completion and query answering. The approach demonstrates that learning implicit constraints from data is sufficient for generating semantically valid knowledge graphs.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph (KG) generation requires models to learn complex semantic dependencies between triples while maintaining domain validity constraints. Unlike link prediction, which scores triples independently, generative models must capture interdependencies across entire subgraphs to produce semantically coherent structures. We present ARK (Auto-Regressive Knowledge Graph Generation), a family of autoregressive models that generate KGs by treating graphs as sequences of (head, relation, tail) triples. ARK learns implicit semantic constraints directly from data, including type consistency, temporal validity, and relational patterns, without explicit rule supervision. On the IntelliGraphs benchmark, our models achieve 89.2% to 100.0% semantic validity across diverse datasets while generating novel graphs not seen during training. We also introduce SAIL, a variational extension of ARK that enables controlled generation through learned latent representations, supporting both unconditional sampling and conditional completion from partial graphs. Our analysis reveals that model capacity (hidden dimensionality >= 64) is more critical than architectural depth for KG generation, with recurrent architectures achieving comparable validity to transformer-based alternatives while offering substantial computational efficiency. These results demonstrate that autoregressive models provide an effective framework for KG generation, with practical applications in knowledge base completion and query answering.

TL;DR: Novel multi-task RL approach using semantic LTL-to-automata translations for task embedding, enabling efficient on-the-fly computation and scaling to complex specifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a universal policy for multi-task RL that can generalize to arbitrary tasks specified as LTL formulae, addressing limitations of existing methods that struggle with complex specifications.

Method: Leverages new semantic LTL-to-automata translations from temporal synthesis to create semantically labelled automata. These automata provide structured state information enabling efficient on-the-fly computation, expressive task embeddings for policy conditioning, and full LTL support.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across various domains and scales to complex specifications where existing methods fail.

Conclusion: The semantic LTL-to-automata approach provides an effective framework for multi-task RL with LTL specifications, offering improved performance and scalability over existing methods.

Abstract: We study multi-task reinforcement learning (RL), a setting in which an agent learns a single, universal policy capable of generalising to arbitrary, possibly unseen tasks. We consider tasks specified as linear temporal logic (LTL) formulae, which are commonly used in formal methods to specify properties of systems, and have recently been successfully adopted in RL. In this setting, we present a novel task embedding technique leveraging a new generation of semantic LTL-to-automata translations, originally developed for temporal synthesis. The resulting semantically labelled automata contain rich, structured information in each state that allow us to (i) compute the automaton efficiently on-the-fly, (ii) extract expressive task embeddings used to condition the policy, and (iii) naturally support full LTL. Experimental results in a variety of domains demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and is able to scale to complex specifications where existing methods fail.

TL;DR: SSM-based code models outperform Transformers in pretraining for capturing code syntax/semantics but forget certain relations during fine-tuning, especially for short-range dependencies; analysis reveals spectral shift and enables architectural improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While SSMs have shown promise as efficient alternatives to Transformers for code understanding tasks, their internal mechanisms remain poorly understood, creating a need for systematic analysis to reveal what SSM-based code models actually learn and how they compare to Transformers.

Method: Conducted first systematic analysis of SSM-based code models with comparative analysis against Transformers; introduced SSM-Interpret, a frequency-domain framework to diagnose learning patterns; proposed architectural modifications based on findings.

Result: SSMs outperform Transformers at capturing code syntax and semantics during pretraining but forget certain syntactic and semantic relations during fine-tuning, particularly for tasks emphasizing short-range dependencies; SSM-Interpret revealed spectral shift toward short-range dependencies during fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The analysis provides insights into SSM learning mechanisms, reveals fine-tuning limitations, and enables architectural improvements that significantly enhance SSM-based code model performance, demonstrating that systematic analysis directly enables better models.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as an efficient alternative to the transformer architecture. Recent studies show that SSMs can match or surpass Transformers on code understanding tasks, such as code retrieval, when trained under similar conditions. However, their internal mechanisms remain a black box. We present the first systematic analysis of what SSM-based code models actually learn and perform the first comparative analysis of SSM and Transformer-based code models. Our analysis reveals that SSMs outperform Transformers at capturing code syntax and semantics in pretraining but forgets certain syntactic and semantic relations during fine-tuning on task, especially when the task emphasizes short-range dependencies. To diagnose this, we introduce SSM-Interpret, a frequency-domain framework that exposes a spectral shift toward short-range dependencies during fine-tuning. Guided by these findings, we propose architectural modifications that significantly improve the performance of SSM-based code model, validating that our analysis directly enables better models.

*Anirudh Chari,Neil Pattanaik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Active concept learning balances query informativeness vs. hypothesis stability. EIG works for complex rules needing falsification but fails on simple concepts due to support mismatch with LLM proposals, while PTS (confirmation bias) maintains proposal validity and converges faster on simple rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the trade-off between query informativeness and hypothesis stability in active concept learning, particularly in neuro-symbolic Bayesian learners using LLMs for hypothesis generation.

Method: Compare Rational Active Learner (maximizing expected information gain) vs. Positive Test Strategy (querying instances predicted positive under current best hypothesis) in neuro-symbolic Bayesian learner with LLM-generated executable programs as hypotheses.

Result: EIG effective for compound/exception-laden rules requiring falsification, but underperforms on simple concepts due to support mismatch between EIG policy and LLM proposal distribution. PTS is information-suboptimal but maintains proposal validity with "safe" queries, leading to faster convergence on simple rules.

Conclusion: Confirmation bias (PTS) may not be a cognitive error but rather a rational adaptation for maintaining tractable inference in sparse, open-ended hypothesis spaces characteristic of human thought.

Abstract: Human concept learning is typically active: learners choose which instances to query or test in order to reduce uncertainty about an underlying rule or category. Active concept learning must balance informativeness of queries against the stability of the learner that generates and scores hypotheses. We study this trade-off in a neuro-symbolic Bayesian learner whose hypotheses are executable programs proposed by a large language model (LLM) and reweighted by Bayesian updating. We compare a Rational Active Learner that selects queries to maximize approximate expected information gain (EIG) and the human-like Positive Test Strategy (PTS) that queries instances predicted to be positive under the current best hypothesis. Across concept-learning tasks in the classic Number Game, EIG is effective when falsification is necessary (e.g., compound or exception-laden rules), but underperforms on simple concepts. We trace this failure to a support mismatch between the EIG policy and the LLM proposal distribution: highly diagnostic boundary queries drive the posterior toward regions where the generator produces invalid or overly specific programs, yielding a support-mismatch trap in the particle approximation. PTS is information-suboptimal but tends to maintain proposal validity by selecting "safe" queries, leading to faster convergence on simple rules. Our results suggest that "confirmation bias" may not be a cognitive error, but rather a rational adaptation for maintaining tractable inference in the sparse, open-ended hypothesis spaces characteristic of human thought.

TL;DR: ScaleEnv is a framework for constructing diverse, interactive environments from scratch to train generalist agents, showing improved performance on unseen tool-use benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a critical scarcity of interactive environments for training generalist agents, and existing synthesis methods have limitations in environmental diversity and scalability.

Method: ScaleEnv constructs fully interactive environments and verifiable tasks from scratch using procedural testing for reliability, tool dependency graph expansion for task completeness, and executable action verification for solvability.

Result: Agents trained with ScaleEnv show significant performance improvements on unseen multi-turn tool-use benchmarks (τ²-Bench and VitaBench), demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: Scaling environmental diversity is critical for robust agent learning, as evidenced by the relationship between increasing domains and model generalization performance.

Abstract: Training generalist agents capable of adapting to diverse scenarios requires interactive environments for self-exploration. However, interactive environments remain critically scarce, and existing synthesis methods suffer from significant limitations regarding environmental diversity and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce ScaleEnv, a framework that constructs fully interactive environments and verifiable tasks entirely from scratch. Specifically, ScaleEnv ensures environment reliability through procedural testing, and guarantees task completeness and solvability via tool dependency graph expansion and executable action verification. By enabling agents to learn through exploration within ScaleEnv, we demonstrate significant performance improvements on unseen, multi-turn tool-use benchmarks such as $τ^2$-Bench and VitaBench, highlighting strong generalization capabilities. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between increasing number of domains and model generalization performance, providing empirical evidence that scaling environmental diversity is critical for robust agent learning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: POP is an online structural pruning framework that dynamically prunes foundation models during inference by partitioning channels and generating context-aware masks, achieving better accuracy with lower overhead than static pruning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current structural pruning methods use fixed pruning decisions during inference, failing to adapt to the dynamic sparsity patterns that emerge during autoregressive token generation in large foundation models.

Method: POP partitions model channels into retained, candidate, and pruned regions. Prefilling defines a coarse pruning partition, while decoding generates fine-grained masks within candidate regions without full-channel re-evaluation. It's a lightweight plug-and-play method requiring no preprocessing.

Result: Extensive evaluations across diverse LFMs (LLMs, MoEs, VLMs) show POP consistently delivers higher accuracy than existing pruning approaches while incurring smaller computational overhead and minimizing inference latency.

Conclusion: POP enables efficient context-conditioned dynamic pruning for large foundation models, overcoming limitations of static pruning methods by adapting to autoregressive generation patterns with minimal computational cost.

Abstract: Large foundation models (LFMs) achieve strong performance through scaling, yet current structural pruning methods derive fixed pruning decisions during inference, overlooking sparsity patterns that emerge in the autoregressive token generation. In this paper, we propose POP (Partition-guided Online Pruning), an efficient online structural pruning framework that enables context-conditioned dynamic pruning with minimal computational overhead. POP partitions model channels into retained, candidate, and pruned regions, where prefilling defines a coarse pruning partition, and the decoding stage generates a fine-grained mask within the candidate region, avoiding full-channel re-evaluation. The coarse pruning partition preserves consistently important weights, while the fine-grained masking provides context-conditioned variation during decoding. Moreover, POP is a lightweight, plug-and-play method that requires no preprocessing, including offline calibration, retraining, or learning predictors. Extensive evaluations across diverse LFMs, including large language models (LLMs), mixture-of-experts models (MoEs), and vision-language models (VLMs), demonstrate that POP consistently delivers higher accuracy than existing pruning approaches while incurring smaller computational overhead and minimizing inference latency.

TL;DR: Game-theoretic framework for predicting and steering LLM population behavior through Nash equilibrium analysis, using human subpopulation mixtures as actions to enable tractable computation and interpretable policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of predicting and regulating behavior in populations of large language models, particularly to avoid intractable equilibrium computation in open-ended text spaces and to provide actionable guidance for steering LLM alignment toward socially desirable outcomes.

Method: Models each LLM agent's action as a mixture over human subpopulations, allowing strategic alignment choices. Derives closed-form Nash equilibrium characterizations using standard concave-utility assumptions, creating an active alignment layer on top of existing alignment pipelines like RLHF.

Result: Shows that LLM populations, especially reasoning-based models, may exhibit political exclusion pathologies where some subpopulations are ignored, but this can be avoided using the proposed method, demonstrating promise for regulating multi-agent LLM dynamics.

Conclusion: The framework provides interpretable, behaviorally substantive policy classes with explicit guidance for shifting alignment targets toward socially desirable outcomes, offering a practical approach to regulate multi-agent LLM dynamics across domains.

Abstract: We develop a game-theoretic framework for predicting and steering the behavior of populations of large language models (LLMs) through Nash equilibrium (NE) analysis. To avoid the intractability of equilibrium computation in open-ended text spaces, we model each agent's action as a mixture over human subpopulations. Agents choose actively and strategically which groups to align with, yielding an interpretable and behaviorally substantive policy class. We derive closed-form NE characterizations, adopting standard concave-utility assumptions to enable analytical system-level predictions and give explicit, actionable guidance for shifting alignment targets toward socially desirable outcomes. The method functions as an active alignment layer on top of existing alignment pipelines such as RLHF. In a social-media setting, we show that a population of LLMs, especially reasoning-based models, may exhibit political exclusion, pathologies where some subpopulations are ignored by all LLM agents, which can be avoided by our method, illustrating the promise of applying the method to regulate multi-agent LLM dynamics across domains.

*Jin Wang,Hui Ma,Fei Xing,Ming Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Adaptive differentially private federated learning framework improves model performance under device heterogeneity and Non-IID data by using local compression, adaptive clipping, and constraint-aware aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning faces challenges with device heterogeneity and Non-IID data causing unstable gradient updates. When differential privacy is added, fixed gradient clipping and noise injection further degrade performance through amplified gradient perturbations.

Method: Proposes adaptive differentially private federated learning with: 1) Client-side lightweight local compressed module to regularize representations and constrain gradient variability, 2) Server-side adaptive gradient clipping that dynamically adjusts thresholds based on historical statistics, and 3) Constraint-aware aggregation mechanism to suppress unreliable client updates.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets demonstrate improved convergence stability and classification accuracy compared to conventional approaches.

Conclusion: The adaptive framework effectively addresses the combined challenges of device heterogeneity, Non-IID data, and differential privacy constraints in federated learning, leading to more stable training and better model performance.

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, in practical deployments, device heterogeneity, non-independent, and identically distributed (Non-IID) data often lead to highly unstable and biased gradient updates. When differential privacy is enforced, conventional fixed gradient clipping and Gaussian noise injection may further amplify gradient perturbations, resulting in training oscillation and performance degradation and degraded model performance. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive differentially private federated learning framework that explicitly targets model efficiency under heterogeneous and privacy-constrained settings. On the client side, a lightweight local compressed module is introduced to regularize intermediate representations and constrain gradient variability, thereby mitigating noise amplification during local optimization. On the server side, an adaptive gradient clipping strategy dynamically adjusts clipping thresholds based on historical update statistics to avoid over-clipping and noise domination. Furthermore, a constraint-aware aggregation mechanism is designed to suppress unreliable or noise-dominated client updates and stabilize global optimization. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and SVHN demonstrate improved convergence stability and classification accuracy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Traditional explainable AI methods for static predictions don't work well for agentic AI systems with multi-step trajectories; trace-based diagnostics are needed instead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current explainable AI focuses on interpreting individual model predictions, but recent advances in LLMs enable agentic AI systems with behavior unfolding over multi-step trajectories. There's a gap in understanding how static explanation methods translate to agentic settings where success/failure depends on sequences of decisions.

Method: Compared attribution-based explanations (for static classification) with trace-based diagnostics (for agentic benchmarks like TAU-bench Airline and AssistantBench). Used empirical comparison across both settings to bridge the gap between static and agentic explainability.

Result: Attribution methods achieve stable feature rankings in static settings (Spearman ρ=0.86) but cannot reliably diagnose execution-level failures in agentic trajectories. Trace-grounded rubric evaluation consistently localizes behavior breakdowns, showing state tracking inconsistency is 2.7× more prevalent in failed runs and reduces success probability by 49%.

Conclusion: Findings motivate a shift towards trajectory-level explainability for agentic systems when evaluating and diagnosing autonomous AI behavior, moving beyond static prediction explanations to trace-based diagnostics.

Abstract: Over the last decade, explainable AI has primarily focused on interpreting individual model predictions, producing post-hoc explanations that relate inputs to outputs under a fixed decision structure. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled agentic AI systems whose behaviour unfolds over multi-step trajectories. In these settings, success and failure are determined by sequences of decisions rather than a single output. While useful, it remains unclear how explanation approaches designed for static predictions translate to agentic settings where behaviour emerges over time. In this work, we bridge the gap between static and agentic explainability by comparing attribution-based explanations with trace-based diagnostics across both settings. To make this distinction explicit, we empirically compare attribution-based explanations used in static classification tasks with trace-based diagnostics used in agentic benchmarks (TAU-bench Airline and AssistantBench). Our results show that while attribution methods achieve stable feature rankings in static settings (Spearman $ρ= 0.86$), they cannot be applied reliably to diagnose execution-level failures in agentic trajectories. In contrast, trace-grounded rubric evaluation for agentic settings consistently localizes behaviour breakdowns and reveals that state tracking inconsistency is 2.7$\times$ more prevalent in failed runs and reduces success probability by 49\%. These findings motivate a shift towards trajectory-level explainability for agentic systems when evaluating and diagnosing autonomous AI behaviour.

These tasks span diverse domains, including language modeling, mathematics, bioinformatics, and time series forecasting. AIRS-Bench tasks assess agentic capabilities over the full research lifecycle -- including idea generation, experiment analysis and iterative refinement -- without providing baseline code. The AIRS-Bench task format is versatile, enabling easy integration of new tasks and rigorous comparison across different agentic frameworks. We establish baselines using frontier models paired with both sequential and parallel scaffolds. Our results show that agents exceed human SOTA in four tasks but fail to match it in sixteen others. Even when agents surpass human benchmarks, they do not reach the theoretical performance ceiling for the underlying tasks. These findings indicate that AIRS-Bench is far from saturated and offers substantial room for improvement.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI agents are overconfident in predicting task success, with some succeeding only 22% of the time but predicting 77% success. Surprisingly, pre-execution assessment with less information sometimes yields better discrimination than post-execution review. Adversarial prompting for bug-finding achieves the best calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study whether AI agents can accurately predict their own task success, examining agentic uncertainty by comparing predictions made before, during, and after task execution.

Method: Eliciting success probability estimates from AI agents at three stages: pre-execution, during execution, and post-execution. Comparing discrimination quality across these stages. Testing adversarial prompting that reframes assessment as bug-finding to improve calibration.

Result: Agents exhibit significant overconfidence - some with only 22% actual success rate predict 77% success. Counterintuitively, pre-execution assessment with less information sometimes yields better discrimination than post-execution review. Adversarial prompting for bug-finding achieves the best calibration among tested methods.

Conclusion: AI agents are generally overconfident in predicting their own success. The timing of assessment matters, with pre-execution sometimes outperforming post-execution. Adversarial prompting that frames assessment as bug-finding can improve calibration, suggesting promising directions for better self-assessment in AI systems.

Abstract: Can AI agents predict whether they will succeed at a task? We study agentic uncertainty by eliciting success probability estimates before, during, and after task execution. All results exhibit agentic overconfidence: some agents that succeed only 22% of the time predict 77% success. Counterintuitively, pre-execution assessment with strictly less information tends to yield better discrimination than standard post-execution review, though differences are not always significant. Adversarial prompting reframing assessment as bug-finding achieves the best calibration.

Abstract: This research presents a dynamic modeling framework and parameter identification methods for describing the highly nonlinear behaviors of flexibly connected dual-AUV systems. The modeling framework is established based on the lumped mass method, integrating axial elasticity, bending stiffness, added mass and hydrodynamic forces, thereby accurately capturing the time-varying response of the forces and cable configurations. To address the difficulty of directly measuring material-related and hydrodynamic coefficients, this research proposes a parameter identification method that combines the physical model with experimental data. High-precision inversion of the equivalent Youngs modulus and hydrodynamic coefficients is performed through tension experiments under multiple configurations, effectively demonstrating that the identified model maintains predictive consistency in various operational conditions. Further numerical analysis indicates that the dynamic properties of flexible cable exhibit significant nonlinear characteristics, which are highly dependent on material property variations and AUV motion conditions. This nonlinear dynamic behavior results in two typical response states, slack and taut, which are jointly determined by boundary conditions and hydrodynamic effects, significantly affecting the cable configuration and endpoint loads. In this research, the dynamics of flexible cables under complex boundary conditions is revealed, providing a theoretical foundation for the design, optimization and further control research of similar systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of partial observability and imperfect monitoring in space operations for autonomous orbital collision avoidance, where traditional methods struggle with noisy and intermittent observations.

Method: Combines configurable encounter simulator, distance-dependent observation model, sequential state estimator, and transformer-based POMDP architecture with long-range temporal attention to interpret noisy observations.

Result: Framework provides foundation for training collision avoidance agents that operate more reliably under imperfect monitoring environments compared to traditional architectures.

Conclusion: Transformer-based RL with POMDP architecture effectively handles partial observability in orbital collision avoidance, enabling more reliable autonomous operations in space with imperfect monitoring.

Abstract: We introduce a Transformer-based Reinforcement Learning framework for autonomous orbital collision avoidance that explicitly models the effects of partial observability and imperfect monitoring in space operations. The framework combines a configurable encounter simulator, a distance-dependent observation model, and a sequential state estimator to represent uncertainty in relative motion. A central contribution of this work is the use of transformer-based Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) architecture, which leverage long-range temporal attention to interpret noisy and intermittent observations more effectively than traditional architectures. This integration provides a foundation for training collision avoidance agents that can operate more reliably under imperfect monitoring environments.

*Ege Yuceel,Daniel Liberzon,Sayan Mitra*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Active localization algorithm for unstable systems using single-bit sensing guarantees exponential contraction of initial-state uncertainty through set-based estimation and Voronoi-based control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand fundamental limitations of minimal feedback (single-bit sensing) for unstable systems and develop localization methods for robotics where sensing is limited to coarse abstractions like keyframes, segmentations, or line-based features.

Method: Develops an active localization algorithm combining set-based estimator with control strategy derived from Voronoi partitions, ensuring agent remains in informative regions while estimating initial state.

Result: Identifies sufficient conditions for initial state recovery despite instability and sparse measurements, proves exponential contraction of initial-state uncertainty, and validates with numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The approach offers theoretical insight into localization in robotics with coarse sensing, demonstrating that active control combined with set-based estimation can overcome limitations of minimal feedback in unstable systems.

Abstract: We study localization and control for unstable systems under coarse, single-bit sensing. Motivated by understanding the fundamental limitations imposed by such minimal feedback, we identify sufficient conditions under which the initial state can be recovered despite instability and extremely sparse measurements. Building on these conditions, we develop an active localization algorithm that integrates a set-based estimator with a control strategy derived from Voronoi partitions, which provably estimates the initial state while ensuring the agent remains in informative regions. Under the derived conditions, the proposed approach guarantees exponential contraction of the initial-state uncertainty, and the result is further supported by numerical experiments. These findings can offer theoretical insight into localization in robotics, where sensing is often limited to coarse abstractions such as keyframes, segmentations, or line-based features.

*Ruizhou Zhao,Yichen Chu,Shuwei Zhao,Wenchao Yue,Raymond Shing-Yan Tang,Hongliang Ren*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Kiri-Capsule: A swallowable kirigami-inspired robot that performs minimally invasive tissue biopsy during capsule endoscopy, enabling histological analysis without conventional invasive procedures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current wireless capsule endoscopy lacks biopsy capability, requiring separate invasive procedures for histological confirmation. Existing swallowable capsules can only sample fluids/microbiota, not structured tissue needed for pathology.

Method: Developed a kirigami-inspired capsule with deployable PI-film flaps actuated by dual-cam mechanism. Flats transform into sharp protrusions for controlled tissue penetration and rotary scraping, with specimens collected in internal fan-shaped cavities.

Result: PI films showed 20 MPa Young's modulus with stable 34° deployment at 15% strain. Ex vivo porcine studies achieved shallow penetration (median ~0.61 mm) with biopsy yields comparable to standard forceps (stomach: ~10.9 mg, intestine: ~18.9 mg) within safe force ranges.

Conclusion: Kiri-Capsule bridges passive imaging with functional biopsy, providing a swallowable, depth-controlled, histology-ready solution that advances capsule-based diagnostics toward safe clinical application.

Abstract: Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) has transformed gastrointestinal (GI) diagnostics by enabling noninvasive visualization of the digestive tract, yet its diagnostic yield remains constrained by the absence of biopsy capability, as histological analysis is still the gold standard for confirming disease. Conventional biopsy using forceps, needles, or rotating blades is invasive, limited in reach, and carries risks of perforation or mucosal trauma, while fluid- or microbiota-sampling capsules cannot provide structured tissue for pathology, leaving a critical gap in swallowable biopsy solutions. Here we present the Kiri-Capsule, a kirigami-inspired capsule robot that integrates deployable PI-film flaps actuated by a compact dual-cam mechanism to achieve minimally invasive and repeatable tissue collection. The kirigami surface remains flat during locomotion but transforms into sharp protrusions upon cam-driven stretching, enabling controlled penetration followed by rotary scraping, with specimens retained in internal fan-shaped cavities. Bench tests confirmed that PI films exhibit a Young's modulus of approximately 20 MPa and stable deployment angles (about 34$^\circ$ at 15% strain), while ex vivo porcine studies demonstrated shallow penetration depths (median $\sim$0.61 mm, range 0.46--0.66 mm) and biopsy yields comparable to standard forceps (mean $\sim$10.9 mg for stomach and $\sim$18.9 mg for intestine), with forces within safe ranges reported for GI biopsy. These findings demonstrate that the Kiri-Capsule bridges passive imaging and functional biopsy, providing a swallowable, depth-controlled, and histology-ready solution that advances capsule-based diagnostics toward safe and effective clinical application.

*Joseph Amigo,Rooholla Khorrambakht,Nicolas Mansard,Ludovic Righetti*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Training RL policies inside learned world models instead of physics simulators, using decoupled diffusion models for efficient gradient computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: World models can capture complex dynamics and sensory information better than standard simulators, but are computationally expensive for RL training. Need efficient method to train policies directly in learned world models without simulators.

Method: Decoupled first-order gradient (FoG) method: full-scale world model generates accurate forward trajectories, while lightweight latent-space surrogate approximates local dynamics for efficient gradient computation. Combines local and global world models.

Result: Significantly outperforms PPO in sample efficiency on Push-T manipulation task. Successfully evaluated on ego-centric object manipulation task with quadruped.

Conclusion: Learning inside data-driven world models is promising for solving hard-to-model RL tasks in image space without reliance on hand-crafted physics simulators.

Abstract: World models offer a promising avenue for more faithfully capturing complex dynamics, including contacts and non-rigidity, as well as complex sensory information, such as visual perception, in situations where standard simulators struggle. However, these models are computationally complex to evaluate, posing a challenge for popular RL approaches that have been successfully used with simulators to solve complex locomotion tasks but yet struggle with manipulation. This paper introduces a method that bypasses simulators entirely, training RL policies inside world models learned from robots' interactions with real environments. At its core, our approach enables policy training with large-scale diffusion models via a novel decoupled first-order gradient (FoG) method: a full-scale world model generates accurate forward trajectories, while a lightweight latent-space surrogate approximates its local dynamics for efficient gradient computation. This coupling of a local and global world model ensures high-fidelity unrolling alongside computationally tractable differentiation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on the Push-T manipulation task, where it significantly outperforms PPO in sample efficiency. We further evaluate our approach through an ego-centric object manipulation task with a quadruped. Together, these results demonstrate that learning inside data-driven world models is a promising pathway for solving hard-to-model RL tasks in image space without reliance on hand-crafted physics simulators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional assistive interfaces (touchscreens, voice commands) are unintuitive and struggle to capture complex user intent for wheelchair and robotic arm control.

Method: Proposed natural dialogue-based interaction protocol simulating an intelligent agent that communicates with users to understand intent and execute assistive actions. Pilot study with 5 participants completing 5 tasks (cleaning, drinking, feeding, drawer/door opening) via dialogue, with manual control baseline.

Result: Most participants enjoyed dialogue-based interaction and assistive robot autonomy based on post-study questionnaire analysis.

Conclusion: Dialogue-based HRI shows promise as a more natural and intuitive interface for assistive robotics compared to traditional control methods.

Abstract: People with lower and upper body disabilities can benefit from wheelchairs and robotic arms to improve mobility and independence. Prior assistive interfaces, such as touchscreens and voice-driven predefined commands, often remain unintuitive and struggle to capture complex user intent. We propose a natural, dialogue based human robot interaction protocol that simulates an intelligent agent capable of communicating with users to understand intent and execute assistive actions. In a pilot study, five participants completed five assistive tasks (cleaning, drinking, feeding, drawer opening, and door opening) through dialogue-based interaction with a wheelchair and robotic arm. As a baseline, participants were required to open a door using the manual control (a wheelchair joystick and a game controller for the arm) and complete a questionnaire to gather their feedback. By analyzing the post-study questionnaires, we found that most participants enjoyed the dialogue-based interaction and assistive robot autonomy.

TL;DR: MORPH wheel is a fully passive variable-radius wheel that mechanically adjusts between 80mm and 45mm based on input torque, using geometry and compliant structures without electronics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a passive variable transmission system that doesn't rely on actuators, sensors, or active control, enabling robotic mobility in unpredictable or control-limited environments through mechanical intelligence.

Method: Uses torque-response coupler and spring-loaded connecting struts to mechanically adjust wheel radius. Developed comprehensive analytical model for mechanical behavior logic and threshold conditions for mode switching between direct drive and radius transformation.

Result: Achieves bidirectional operation with unlimited rotation, high torque capacity (>10N), and precise transmission ratio control. Experimental validation showed torque-radius and force-displacement characteristics match theoretical predictions across wheel weights (1.8-2.8kg). Robot demonstrations on varying loads (0-25kg), slopes, and unstructured terrains verified passive radius adjustment for optimal transmission ratio.

Conclusion: MORPH wheel demonstrates mechanically programmed structures that embed intelligent, context-dependent behavior directly into physical design, offering a new paradigm for passive variable transmission and mechanical intelligence in robotic systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Mechacnially prOgrammed Radius-adjustable PHysical (MORPH) wheel, a fully passive variable-radius wheel that embeds mechanical behavior logic for torque-responsive transformation. Unlike conventional variable transmission systems relying on actuators, sensors, and active control, the MORPH wheel achieves passive adaptation solely through its geometry and compliant structure. The design integrates a torque-response coupler and spring-loaded connecting struts to mechanically adjust the wheel radius between 80 mm and 45 mm in response to input torque, without any electrical components. The MORPH wheel provides three unique capabilities rarely achieved simultaneously in previous passive designs: (1) bidirectional operation with unlimited rotation through a symmetric coupler; (2) high torque capacity exceeding 10 N with rigid power transmission in drive mode; and (3) precise and repeatable transmission ratio control governed by deterministic kinematics. A comprehensive analytical model was developed to describe the wheel's mechanical behavior logic, establishing threshold conditions for mode switching between direct drive and radius transformation. Experimental validation confirmed that the measured torque-radius and force-displacement characteristics closely follow theoretical predictions across wheel weights of 1.8-2.8kg. Robot-level demonstrations on varying loads (0-25kg), slopes, and unstructured terrains further verified that the MORPH wheel passively adjusts its radius to provide optimal transmission ratio. The MORPH wheel exemplifies a mechanically programmed structure, embedding intelligent, context-dependent behavior directly into its physical design. This approach offers a new paradigm for passive variable transmission and mechanical intelligence in robotic mobility systems operating in unpredictable or control-limited environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Flat-Plane Mechanisms (FPMs) use geometric inversion of a sphere into a plane to create planar motion systems that derive planarity from link lengths and connectivity, eliminating need for external metrology and attenuating fabrication errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional precision robotic motion systems rely on flat components and precise alignment, creating long error-sensitive reference chains. There's a need for planar motion systems that don't depend on external flatness references.

Method: Using geometric inversion of a sphere into a plane to create Flat-Plane Mechanisms (FPMs) where planar motion emerges from self-referencing geometric constraints based on link lengths and connectivity.

Result: Demonstrated FPMs from micron to meter scales, showing fabrication errors attenuated by an order of magnitude in resulting flatness. Built robotic 3-axis positioning system capable of metrology surface scans (±12mm) and 3D printing inside narrow containers.

Conclusion: Establishes alternative geometric foundation for planar motion that works across size scales, opening new possibilities in metrology, fabrication, and micro-positioning without external flatness references.

Abstract: Constraining motion to a flat surface is a fundamental requirement for equipment across science and engineering. Modern precision robotic motion systems, such as gantries, rely on the flatness of components, including guide rails and granite surface plates. However, translating this static flatness into motion requires precise internal alignment and tight-tolerance components that create long, error-sensitive reference chains. Here, we show that by using the geometric inversion of a sphere into a plane, we can produce robotic motion systems that derive planarity entirely from link lengths and connectivity. This allows planar motion to emerge from self-referencing geometric constraints, and without external metrology. We demonstrate these Flat-Plane Mechanisms (FPMs) from micron to meter scales and show that fabrication errors can be attenuated by an order of magnitude in the resulting flatness. Finally, we present a robotic FPM-based 3-axis positioning system that can be used for metrology surface scans ($\pm 12$-mm) and 3D printing inside narrow containers. This work establishes an alternative geometric foundation for planar motion that can be realized across size scales and opens new possibilities in metrology, fabrication, and micro-positioning.

TL;DR: Internal morphogenesis model for autonomous systems using local interactions without external spatial computation, enabling complex growth and regeneration through token exchange between adjacent modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional self-organizing models require impractical external spatial computations across entire coordinate spaces, which is inefficient for resource-constrained physical modules like swarm robotics and micro-nanomachines.

Method: Extends the "Ishida token model" using RD-inspired discrete analogue where modules exchange integer values locally. Internal potential from token accumulation and aging guides autonomous behaviors without solving differential equations.

Result: Simulations on hexagonal grid demonstrated emergence of limb-like extensions, self-division, and robust regeneration after structural amputation. Body boundary serves as natural sink for information entropy to maintain dynamic equilibrium.

Conclusion: Sophisticated morphological behaviors can emerge from minimal internal-only rules, offering computationally efficient and biologically plausible approach for self-repairing, adaptive autonomous hardware.

Abstract: This study presents an internalized morphogenesis model for autonomous systems, such as swarm robotics and micro-nanomachines, that eliminates the need for external spatial computation. Traditional self-organizing models often require calculations across the entire coordinate space, including empty areas, which is impractical for resource-constrained physical modules. Our proposed model achieves complex morphogenesis through strictly local interactions between adjacent modules within the "body." By extending the "Ishida token model," modules exchange integer values using an RD-inspired discrete analogue without solving differential equations. The internal potential, derived from token accumulation and aging, guides autonomous growth, shrinkage, and replication. Simulations on a hexagonal grid demonstrated the emergence of limb-like extensions, self-division, and robust regeneration capabilities following structural amputation. A key feature is the use of the body boundary as a natural sink for information entropy (tokens) to maintain a dynamic equilibrium. These results indicate that sophisticated morphological behaviors can emerge from minimal, internal-only rules. This framework offers a computationally efficient and biologically plausible approach to developing self-repairing, adaptive, and autonomous hardware.

TL;DR: Generative robot policies face fundamental structural barriers causing action hallucinations that violate physical constraints, requiring architectural improvements rather than abandoning expressive power.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While robot foundation models show impressive generalization, it's unclear if they truly solve long-standing robotics challenges, particularly regarding action hallucinations that violate physical constraints and extend to plan-level failures.

Method: Analyze latent-variable generative policies to identify structural mismatches between feasible robot behavior and common model architectures, focusing on three barriers: topological, precision, and horizon.

Result: Hallucinations arise from fundamental architectural mismatches that impose unavoidable tradeoffs, providing mechanistic explanations for empirical failures of generative robot policies.

Conclusion: The analysis suggests principled directions for improving reliability and trustworthiness in generative robot policies without abandoning their expressive power, addressing structural barriers rather than just empirical failures.

Abstract: Robot Foundation Models such as Vision-Language-Action models are rapidly reshaping how robot policies are trained and deployed, replacing hand-designed planners with end-to-end generative action models. While these systems demonstrate impressive generalization, it remains unclear whether they fundamentally resolve the long-standing challenges of robotics. We address this question by analyzing action hallucinations that violate physical constraints and their extension to plan-level failures. Focusing on latent-variable generative policies, we show that hallucinations often arise from structural mismatches between feasible robot behavior and common model architectures. We study three such barriers -- topological, precision, and horizon -- and show how they impose unavoidable tradeoffs. Our analysis provides mechanistic explanations for reported empirical failures of generative robot policies and suggests principled directions for improving reliability and trustworthiness, without abandoning their expressive power.

TL;DR: HiWET: Hierarchical RL framework for humanoid loco-manipulation that decouples global world-frame reasoning from dynamic execution, achieving precise end-effector tracking and stable locomotion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for humanoid loco-manipulation use body-centric frames that fail to correct cumulative world-frame drift from legged locomotion, limiting precise manipulation during movement.

Method: HiWET uses hierarchical RL with high-level policy generating world-frame subgoals for end-effector accuracy and base positioning, low-level policy executing under stability constraints, plus Kinematic Manifold Prior embedding manipulation manifold via residual learning.

Result: Achieves precise and stable end-effector tracking in long-horizon world-frame tasks in simulation, with zero-shot sim-to-real transfer demonstrating stable locomotion under diverse manipulation commands on physical humanoid.

Conclusion: Explicit world-frame reasoning combined with hierarchical control provides effective and scalable solution for long-horizon humanoid loco-manipulation, addressing drift issues of body-centric approaches.

Abstract: Humanoid loco-manipulation requires executing precise manipulation tasks while maintaining dynamic stability amid base motion and impacts. Existing approaches typically formulate commands in body-centric frames, fail to inherently correct cumulative world-frame drift induced by legged locomotion. We reformulate the problem as world-frame end-effector tracking and propose HiWET, a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that decouples global reasoning from dynamic execution. The high-level policy generates subgoals that jointly optimize end-effector accuracy and base positioning in the world frame, while the low-level policy executes these commands under stability constraints. We introduce a Kinematic Manifold Prior (KMP) that embeds the manipulation manifold into the action space via residual learning, reducing exploration dimensionality and mitigating kinematically invalid behaviors. Extensive simulation and ablation studies demonstrate that HiWET achieves precise and stable end-effector tracking in long-horizon world-frame tasks. We validate zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of the low-level policy on a physical humanoid, demonstrating stable locomotion under diverse manipulation commands. These results indicate that explicit world-frame reasoning combined with hierarchical control provides an effective and scalable solution for long-horizon humanoid loco-manipulation.

TL;DR: BudVLN addresses exposure bias in Vision-Language Navigation by correcting instruction-state misalignment through retrospective rectification and decision-conditioned supervision synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper identifies a critical limitation in existing VLN approaches: Instruction-State Misalignment, where forcing agents to learn recovery actions from off-track states creates supervision signals that semantically conflict with the original instructions, compounding errors during inference.

Method: BudVLN is an online framework that learns from on-policy rollouts by constructing supervision to match the current state distribution. It performs retrospective rectification via counterfactual re-anchoring and decision-conditioned supervision synthesis, using a geodesic oracle to synthesize corrective trajectories from valid historical states to ensure semantic consistency.

Result: Experiments on R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks show that BudVLN consistently mitigates distribution shift and achieves state-of-the-art performance in both Success Rate and SPL metrics.

Conclusion: BudVLN effectively addresses the instruction-state misalignment problem in VLN through its novel online learning framework with retrospective rectification, leading to improved navigation performance by ensuring semantic consistency between instructions and corrective supervision.

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) requires embodied agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate through complex continuous 3D environments. However, the dominant imitation learning paradigm suffers from exposure bias, where minor deviations during inference lead to compounding errors. While DAgger-style approaches attempt to mitigate this by correcting error states, we identify a critical limitation: Instruction-State Misalignment. Forcing an agent to learn recovery actions from off-track states often creates supervision signals that semantically conflict with the original instruction. In response to these challenges, we introduce BudVLN, an online framework that learns from on-policy rollouts by constructing supervision to match the current state distribution. BudVLN performs retrospective rectification via counterfactual re-anchoring and decision-conditioned supervision synthesis, using a geodesic oracle to synthesize corrective trajectories that originate from valid historical states, ensuring semantic consistency. Experiments on the standard R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks demonstrate that BudVLN consistently mitigates distribution shift and achieves state-of-the-art performance in both Success Rate and SPL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current open-loop environment generation creates diverse but inefficient training scenes without considering agent performance, leading to trivial challenges and limited learning signal.

Method: Uses controllable environment representation, extracts fine-grained performance feedback beyond binary success/failure, and implements closed-loop adaptation mechanism that translates feedback into environment modifications.

Result: Feedback-driven approach generates training environments that are more challenging in ways the agent needs to improve.

Conclusion: Closed-loop environment generation enables more efficient learning and better generalization to novel settings compared to open-loop approaches.

Abstract: Embodied agents struggle to generalize to new environments, even when those environments share similar underlying structures to their training settings. Most current approaches to generating these training environments follow an open-loop paradigm, without considering the agent's current performance. While procedural generation methods can produce diverse scenes, diversity without feedback from the agent is inefficient. The generated environments may be trivially easy, providing limited learning signal. To address this, we present a proof-of-concept for closed-loop environment generation that adapts difficulty to the agent's current capabilities. Our system employs a controllable environment representation, extracts fine-grained performance feedback beyond binary success or failure, and implements a closed-loop adaptation mechanism that translates this feedback into environment modifications. This feedback-driven approach generates training environments that more challenging in the ways the agent needs to improve, enabling more efficient learning and better generalization to novel settings.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves estimator consistency in LiDAR-inertial SLAM systems through tailored parameterization and FEJ-based bundle adjustment, with application to LiDAR-inertial odometry.

Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using 3D LiDAR has emerged as a cornerstone for autonomous navigation in robotics. While feature-based SLAM systems have achieved impressive results by leveraging edge and planar structures, they often suffer from the inconsistent estimator associated with feature parameterization and estimated covariance. In this work, we present a consistency-improved LiDAR-inertial bundle adjustment (BA) with tailored parameterization and estimator. First, we propose a stereographic-projection representation parameterizing the planar and edge features, and conduct a comprehensive observability analysis to support its integrability with consistent estimator. Second, we implement a LiDAR-inertial BA with Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) formulation and First-Estimate Jacobians (FEJ) to preserve the accurate estimated covariance and observability properties of the system. Last, we apply our proposed BA method to a LiDAR-inertial odometry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Two key challenges in vision-based humanoid locomotion: 1) sim-to-real gap introduces perception noise degrading fine-grained tasks, and 2) training unified policies across diverse terrains is hindered by conflicting learning objectives.

Method: 1) High-fidelity depth sensor simulation capturing stereo matching artifacts and calibration uncertainties; 2) Vision-aware behavior distillation combining latent space alignment with noise-invariant auxiliary tasks; 3) Terrain-specific reward shaping with multi-critic and multi-discriminator learning for distinct terrain dynamics.

Result: Validated on two humanoid platforms with different stereo depth cameras. Policy demonstrates robust performance across diverse environments, handling extreme challenges (high platforms, wide gaps) and fine-grained tasks (bidirectional long-term staircase traversal).

Conclusion: End-to-end framework successfully addresses sim-to-real transfer and terrain adaptation challenges for vision-driven humanoid locomotion, enabling robust performance across diverse real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Achieving robust vision-based humanoid locomotion remains challenging due to two fundamental issues: the sim-to-real gap introduces significant perception noise that degrades performance on fine-grained tasks, and training a unified policy across diverse terrains is hindered by conflicting learning objectives. To address these challenges, we present an end-to-end framework for vision-driven humanoid locomotion. For robust sim-to-real transfer, we develop a high-fidelity depth sensor simulation that captures stereo matching artifacts and calibration uncertainties inherent in real-world sensing. We further propose a vision-aware behavior distillation approach that combines latent space alignment with noise-invariant auxiliary tasks, enabling effective knowledge transfer from privileged height maps to noisy depth observations. For versatile terrain adaptation, we introduce terrain-specific reward shaping integrated with multi-critic and multi-discriminator learning, where dedicated networks capture the distinct dynamics and motion priors of each terrain type. We validate our approach on two humanoid platforms equipped with different stereo depth cameras. The resulting policy demonstrates robust performance across diverse environments, seamlessly handling extreme challenges such as high platforms and wide gaps, as well as fine-grained tasks including bidirectional long-term staircase traversal.

TL;DR: ECO is a constrained RL framework that treats energy consumption as explicit constraints rather than reward components, enabling more efficient and interpretable energy-efficient humanoid locomotion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MPC and RL approaches for humanoid locomotion embed energy metrics within multi-objective optimization, requiring extensive hyperparameter tuning and often yielding suboptimal policies. There's a need for clearer separation of energy concerns from rewards for more efficient and interpretable energy management.

Method: ECO (Energy-Constrained Optimization) reformulates energy-related metrics as explicit inequality constraints rather than reward components. It introduces dedicated constraints for energy consumption and reference motion, enforced via the Lagrangian method, to achieve stable, symmetric, and energy-efficient walking.

Result: ECO significantly reduces energy consumption compared to MPC, standard RL with reward shaping, and four state-of-the-art constrained RL methods. Experiments on the kid-sized humanoid robot BRUCE demonstrate robust walking performance with improved energy efficiency in both sim-to-sim and sim-to-real transfers.

Conclusion: ECO represents a substantial advancement in energy-efficient humanoid locomotion by providing a clear, interpretable framework that separates energy constraints from rewards, enabling more efficient hyperparameter tuning and better energy management while maintaining stable walking performance.

Abstract: Achieving stable and energy-efficient locomotion is essential for humanoid robots to operate continuously in real-world applications. Existing MPC and RL approaches often rely on energy-related metrics embedded within a multi-objective optimization framework, which require extensive hyperparameter tuning and often result in suboptimal policies. To address these challenges, we propose ECO (Energy-Constrained Optimization), a constrained RL framework that separates energy-related metrics from rewards, reformulating them as explicit inequality constraints. This method provides a clear and interpretable physical representation of energy costs, enabling more efficient and intuitive hyperparameter tuning for improved energy efficiency. ECO introduces dedicated constraints for energy consumption and reference motion, enforced by the Lagrangian method, to achieve stable, symmetric, and energy-efficient walking for humanoid robots. We evaluated ECO against MPC, standard RL with reward shaping, and four state-of-the-art constrained RL methods. Experiments, including sim-to-sim and sim-to-real transfers on the kid-sized humanoid robot BRUCE, demonstrate that ECO significantly reduces energy consumption compared to baselines while maintaining robust walking performance. These results highlight a substantial advancement in energy-efficient humanoid locomotion.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: UcON introduces a new benchmark for object navigation that incorporates user-specific placement habits, requiring agents to leverage personalized patterns for better navigation decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing object navigation benchmarks use general scene priors without accounting for individual user placement habits, limiting agent adaptability in personalized household environments.

Method: Proposes User-centric Object Navigation (UcON) benchmark with 22,600 user habits across 489 object categories, plus a habit retrieval module to extract and utilize target object habits for location inference.

Result: Current SOTA methods show significant performance degradation under habit-driven placement, while integrating user habits consistently improves success rates in object navigation.

Conclusion: UcON is the first large-scale benchmark for habit-conditioned object navigation, demonstrating the importance of incorporating user-specific habits for more effective and personalized navigation agents.

Abstract: In the evolving field of robotics, the challenge of Object Navigation (ON) in household environments has attracted significant interest. Existing ON benchmarks typically place objects in locations guided by general scene priors, without accounting for the specific placement habits of individual users. This omission limits the adaptability of navigation agents in personalized household environments. To address this, we introduce User-centric Object Navigation (UcON), a new benchmark that incorporates user-specific object placement habits, referred to as user habits. This benchmark requires agents to leverage these user habits for more informed decision-making during navigation. UcON encompasses approximately 22,600 user habits across 489 object categories. UcON is, to our knowledge, the first benchmark that explicitly formalizes and evaluates habit-conditioned object navigation at scale and covers the widest range of target object categories. Additionally, we propose a habit retrieval module to extract and utilize habits related to target objects, enabling agents to infer their likely locations more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that current SOTA methods exhibit substantial performance degradation under habit-driven object placement, while integrating user habits consistently improves success rates.

TL;DR: MultiGraspNet is a unified 3D deep learning framework that simultaneously predicts feasible grasp poses for both parallel and vacuum grippers, enabling a single robot to handle multiple end effectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robotic grasping approaches are limited: they either target single grippers requiring costly dual-arm setups, or rely on custom hybrid grippers with ad-hoc learning procedures that can't transfer across tasks, restricting general applicability.

Method: A multitask 3D deep learning method trained on aligned GraspNet-1Billion and SuctionNet-1Billion datasets. The model shares early-stage features while maintaining gripper-specific refiners, generating graspability masks that quantify suitability of each scene point for successful grasps.

Result: The model demonstrates competitiveness with single-task models on benchmarks. Real-world experiments on a single-arm multi-gripper setup show it outperforms vacuum baselines by 16% on seen objects and 32% on novel objects, while obtaining competitive results for parallel grasping.

Conclusion: MultiGraspNet provides a unified framework that effectively leverages complementary information across grasping modalities, enhancing robustness and adaptability in cluttered scenes while enabling single robots to handle multiple end effectors.

Abstract: Vision-based models for robotic grasping automate critical, repetitive, and draining industrial tasks. Existing approaches are typically limited in two ways: they either target a single gripper and are potentially applied on costly dual-arm setups, or rely on custom hybrid grippers that require ad-hoc learning procedures with logic that cannot be transferred across tasks, restricting their general applicability. In this work, we present MultiGraspNet, a novel multitask 3D deep learning method that predicts feasible poses simultaneously for parallel and vacuum grippers within a unified framework, enabling a single robot to handle multiple end effectors. The model is trained on the richly annotated GraspNet-1Billion and SuctionNet-1Billion datasets, which have been aligned for the purpose, and generates graspability masks quantifying the suitability of each scene point for successful grasps. By sharing early-stage features while maintaining gripper-specific refiners, MultiGraspNet effectively leverages complementary information across grasping modalities, enhancing robustness and adaptability in cluttered scenes. We characterize MultiGraspNet's performance with an extensive experimental analysis, demonstrating its competitiveness with single-task models on relevant benchmarks. We run real-world experiments on a single-arm multi-gripper robotic setup showing that our approach outperforms the vacuum baseline, grasping 16% percent more seen objects and 32% more of the novel ones, while obtaining competitive results for the parallel task.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: World-VLA-Loop is a closed-loop framework that jointly refines video world models and Vision-Language-Action policies through iterative co-evolution, enabling RL post-training entirely in virtual environments with minimal physical interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video diffusion transformer world models for robotics can simulate realistic visual outcomes but suffer from poor action-following precision, limiting their utility for downstream robotic learning applications.

Method: Introduces World-VLA-Loop with a state-aware video world model that jointly predicts future observations and rewards, uses the SANS dataset with near-success trajectories for better alignment, and creates a closed-loop where VLA policy failures refine the world model, which then improves subsequent RL optimization.

Result: The framework significantly boosts VLA performance across simulation and real-world tasks with minimal physical interaction, establishing a mutually beneficial relationship between world modeling and policy learning for general-purpose robotics.

Conclusion: World-VLA-Loop demonstrates an effective co-evolving cycle between world models and policies that enhances robotic learning while reducing reliance on physical interaction, advancing the field of general-purpose robotics through improved virtual training environments.

Abstract: Recent progress in robotic world models has leveraged video diffusion transformers to predict future observations conditioned on historical states and actions. While these models can simulate realistic visual outcomes, they often exhibit poor action-following precision, hindering their utility for downstream robotic learning. In this work, we introduce World-VLA-Loop, a closed-loop framework for the joint refinement of world models and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies. We propose a state-aware video world model that functions as a high-fidelity interactive simulator by jointly predicting future observations and reward signals. To enhance reliability, we introduce the SANS dataset, which incorporates near-success trajectories to improve action-outcome alignment within the world model. This framework enables a closed-loop for reinforcement learning (RL) post-training of VLA policies entirely within a virtual environment. Crucially, our approach facilitates a co-evolving cycle: failure rollouts generated by the VLA policy are iteratively fed back to refine the world model precision, which in turn enhances subsequent RL optimization. Evaluations across simulation and real-world tasks demonstrate that our framework significantly boosts VLA performance with minimal physical interaction, establishing a mutually beneficial relationship between world modeling and policy learning for general-purpose robotics.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: APA (Approaching-Phase Augmentation) addresses long-tail distribution in robot policy learning by transferring knowledge from data-rich head tasks to data-scarce tail tasks, improving spatial reasoning without external demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalist robot policies trained on long-tail demonstration distributions perform poorly on data-scarce tail tasks due to skewed training data favoring head tasks, limiting real-world generalization.

Method: Introduces Approaching-Phase Augmentation (APA) that transfers knowledge from head tasks to tail tasks by augmenting the approaching phase of manipulation, addressing spatial reasoning deficiencies without requiring additional demonstrations.

Result: APA significantly improves policy performance on tail tasks in both simulation and real-world manipulation experiments, outperforming conventional long-tail learning strategies like re-sampling.

Conclusion: The long-tail challenge in policy learning stems from impaired spatial reasoning on tail tasks, and APA provides an effective solution by transferring knowledge from head tasks without external data.

Abstract: While generalist robot policies hold significant promise for learning diverse manipulation skills through imitation, their performance is often hindered by the long-tail distribution of training demonstrations. Policies learned on such data, which is heavily skewed towards a few data-rich head tasks, frequently exhibit poor generalization when confronted with the vast number of data-scarce tail tasks. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the pervasive long-tail challenge inherent in policy learning. Our analysis begins by demonstrating the inefficacy of conventional long-tail learning strategies (e.g., re-sampling) for improving the policy's performance on tail tasks. We then uncover the underlying mechanism for this failure, revealing that data scarcity on tail tasks directly impairs the policy's spatial reasoning capability. To overcome this, we introduce Approaching-Phase Augmentation (APA), a simple yet effective scheme that transfers knowledge from data-rich head tasks to data-scarce tail tasks without requiring external demonstrations. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world manipulation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of APA.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Axiomatic correctness specification for robot body motions that decomposes task achievement into semantic, causal, and embodiment verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous agents need to ensure their body motions are semantically correct, causally effective, and feasible for their embodiment when performing everyday manipulation tasks.

Method: Introduce Law of Task-Achieving Body Motion using scoped Task-Environment-Embodiment (TEE) classes with Semantic Digital Twins (SDTs) and physics models, decomposing into three predicates: SatisfiesRequest (semantic), Causes (causal), and CanPerform (embodiment feasibility).

Result: Creates reusable, implementation-independent interface supporting motion synthesis, verification, typed failure diagnosis, cross-robot feasibility, and counterfactual reasoning about body motions.

Conclusion: Demonstrated practical usability by instantiating the law for articulated container manipulation in kitchen environments across three different mobile manipulation platforms.

Abstract: Autonomous agents that perform everyday manipulation actions need to ensure that their body motions are semantically correct with respect to a task request, causally effective within their environment, and feasible for their embodiment. In order to enable robots to verify these properties, we introduce the Law of Task-Achieving Body Motion as an axiomatic correctness specification for body motions. To that end we introduce scoped Task-Environment-Embodiment (TEE) classes that represent world states as Semantic Digital Twins (SDTs) and define applicable physics models to decompose task achievement into three predicates: SatisfiesRequest for semantic request satisfaction over SDT state evolution; Causes for causal sufficiency under the scoped physics model; and CanPerform for safety and feasibility verification at the embodiment level. This decomposition yields a reusable, implementation-independent interface that supports motion synthesis and the verification of given body motions. It also supports typed failure diagnosis (semantic, causal, embodiment and out-of-scope), feasibility across robots and environments, and counterfactual reasoning about robot body motions. We demonstrate the usability of the law in practice by instantiating it for articulated container manipulation in kitchen environments on three contrasting mobile manipulation platforms

*Fangyuan Wang,Peng Zhou,Jiaming Qi,Shipeng Lyu,David Navarro-Alarcon,Guodong Guo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ThinkProprio improves VLA models by converting proprioception to text tokens and fusing them early with task instructions, enabling robot state to influence visual reasoning and token selection, reducing inference latency by over 50% while maintaining or improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models only inject proprioception as a late conditioning signal, preventing robot state from shaping instruction understanding and influencing visual attention throughout the policy.

Method: Convert proprioception into text tokens in VLM embedding space and fuse them with task instructions at input (early fusion). This allows embodied state to participate in visual reasoning and token selection, enabling selective attention to action-critical evidence while suppressing redundant visual tokens.

Result: Text tokenization outperforms learned projectors; retaining only ~15% of visual tokens matches full token set performance. Across CALVIN, LIBERO, and real-world manipulation, ThinkProprio matches or improves over strong baselines while reducing end-to-end inference latency over 50%.

Conclusion: Early fusion of proprioception as text tokens enables more effective state-conditioned visual reasoning and efficient token selection, achieving better performance with significantly reduced computational overhead.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models typically inject proprioception only as a late conditioning signal, which prevents robot state from shaping instruction understanding and from influencing which visual tokens are attended throughout the policy. We introduce ThinkProprio, which converts proprioception into a sequence of text tokens in the VLM embedding space and fuses them with the task instruction at the input. This early fusion lets embodied state participate in subsequent visual reasoning and token selection, biasing computation toward action-critical evidence while suppressing redundant visual tokens. In a systematic ablation over proprioception encoding, state entry point, and action-head conditioning, we find that text tokenization is more effective than learned projectors, and that retaining roughly 15% of visual tokens can match the performance of using the full token set. Across CALVIN, LIBERO, and real-world manipulation, ThinkProprio matches or improves over strong baselines while reducing end-to-end inference latency over 50%.

*Hiroshi Sato,Sho Sakaino,Toshiaki Tsuji*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A force generative model that estimates force commands from position trajectories, enhanced with feedback control for handling unseen trajectories, enabling better generalization in robot writing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Force control in contact-rich tasks is hardware-dependent and challenging for foundation models like VLA, while position trajectories are easier to obtain but appropriate force commands remain unknown.

Method: Propose a force generative model that estimates force commands from position trajectories, then add feedback control mechanism. Found memory in model causes instability, so adopt memoryless model for stable feedback control.

Result: Feedback control enables effective force command generation for unseen position trajectories, improving generalization in real-world robot writing tasks when using memoryless model.

Conclusion: Memoryless force generative model with feedback control successfully bridges the gap between position trajectories and hardware-specific force commands, enabling better generalization for contact-rich robotic tasks.

Abstract: In contact-rich tasks, while position trajectories are often easy to obtain, appropriate force commands are typically unknown. Although it is conceivable to generate force commands using a pretrained foundation model such as Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, force control is highly dependent on the specific hardware of the robot, which makes the application of such models challenging. To bridge this gap, we propose a force generative model that estimates force commands from given position trajectories. However, when dealing with unseen position trajectories, the model struggles to generate accurate force commands. To address this, we introduce a feedback control mechanism. Our experiments reveal that feedback control does not converge when the force generative model has memory. We therefore adopt a model without memory, enabling stable feedback control. This approach allows the system to generate force commands effectively, even for unseen position trajectories, improving generalization for real-world robot writing tasks.

Conclusion: HuMI provides an efficient portable framework for learning diverse whole-body manipulation skills that generalizes well to unseen environments, overcoming limitations of current teleoperation and sim-to-real approaches.

Abstract: Current approaches for humanoid whole-body manipulation, primarily relying on teleoperation or visual sim-to-real reinforcement learning, are hindered by hardware logistics and complex reward engineering. Consequently, demonstrated autonomous skills remain limited and are typically restricted to controlled environments. In this paper, we present the Humanoid Manipulation Interface (HuMI), a portable and efficient framework for learning diverse whole-body manipulation tasks across various environments. HuMI enables robot-free data collection by capturing rich whole-body motion using portable hardware. This data drives a hierarchical learning pipeline that translates human motions into dexterous and feasible humanoid skills. Extensive experiments across five whole-body tasks--including kneeling, squatting, tossing, walking, and bimanual manipulation--demonstrate that HuMI achieves a 3x increase in data collection efficiency compared to teleoperation and attains a 70% success rate in unseen environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic manipulation research is iterative but slowed by mechanical refitting and system re-integration for minor end-effector changes, creating friction in testing different tactile sensing, gripper geometries, and sensor placements.

Method: RAPID uses a tool-free modular hardware architecture for handheld data collection and robot deployment, combined with a software stack featuring a driver-level Physical Mask derived from USB events that maintains real-time hardware configuration awareness.

Result: RAPID reduces multi-modal configuration setup time by two orders of magnitude compared to traditional workflows and enables policy execution to continue during runtime sensor hot-unplug events.

Conclusion: RAPID's modular hardware and software stack makes systematic ablation studies practical, accelerates robotic manipulation research iteration, and is open-sourced for community use.

Abstract: Developing robotic manipulation policies is iterative and hypothesis-driven: researchers test tactile sensing, gripper geometries, and sensor placements through real-world data collection and training. Yet even minor end-effector changes often require mechanical refitting and system re-integration, slowing iteration. We present RAPID, a full-stack reconfigurable platform designed to reduce this friction. RAPID is built around a tool-free, modular hardware architecture that unifies handheld data collection and robot deployment, and a matching software stack that maintains real-time awareness of the underlying hardware configuration through a driver-level Physical Mask derived from USB events. This modular hardware architecture reduces reconfiguration to seconds and makes systematic multi-modal ablation studies practical, allowing researchers to sweep diverse gripper and sensing configurations without repeated system bring-up. The Physical Mask exposes modality presence as an explicit runtime signal, enabling auto-configuration and graceful degradation under sensor hot-plug events, so policies can continue executing when sensors are physically added or removed. System-centric experiments show that RAPID reduces the setup time for multi-modal configurations by two orders of magnitude compared to traditional workflows and preserves policy execution under runtime sensor hot-unplug events. The hardware designs, drivers, and software stack are open-sourced at https://rapid-kit.github.io/ .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safe and computationally efficient local planning for mobile robots in dense human crowds is challenging. Ensuring human-like robot trajectories increases acceptance in human environments.

Method: Two components: 1) Train Conditional Flow-Matching policy on optimally controlled trajectories to learn collision-free primitives; 2) Learn score function from human demonstrations to evaluate human-likeness of trajectories.

Result: CFM policy alone achieves higher success rate than existing learning-based baselines. With inference-time refinement, outperforms expensive optimization-based approaches. Scoring network selects trajectories closer to expert data than manual cost functions.

Conclusion: Crowd-FM addresses both safety and human-likeness challenges in robot navigation through crowd, improving over state-of-the-art methods with better collision avoidance and more natural motion.

Abstract: Safe and computationally efficient local planning for mobile robots in dense, unstructured human crowds remains a fundamental challenge. Moreover, ensuring that robot trajectories are similar to how a human moves will increase the acceptance of the robot in human environments. In this paper, we present Crowd-FM, a learning-based approach to address both safety and human-likeness challenges. Our approach has two novel components. First, we train a Conditional Flow-Matching (CFM) policy over a dataset of optimally controlled trajectories to learn a set of collision-free primitives that a robot can choose at any given scenario. The chosen optimal control solver can generate multi-modal collision-free trajectories, allowing the CFM policy to learn a diverse set of maneuvers. Secondly, we learn a score function over a dataset of human demonstration trajectories that provides a human-likeness score for the flow primitives. At inference time, computing the optimal trajectory requires selecting the one with the highest score. Our approach improves the state-of-the-art by showing that our CFM policy alone can produce collision-free navigation with a higher success rate than existing learning-based baselines. Furthermore, when augmented with inference-time refinement, our approach can outperform even expensive optimisation-based planning approaches. Finally, we validate that our scoring network can select trajectories closer to the expert data than a manually designed cost function.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial robots need to cover workpiece surfaces fully while keeping tools perpendicular, but existing methods lack sufficient feasibility analysis for full surface coverage.

Method: Proposes sampling-based approach using extended ambient configuration space to represent tool position/orientation constraints, with continuation-based exploration using two sampling strategies.

Result: Thorough evaluation across different kinematics and environments validates ability to accurately and efficiently calculate surface coverage for complex surfaces in complicated environments.

Conclusion: The approach enables accurate and efficient feasibility analysis of full surface coverage for industrial robot applications with complex surfaces and environments.

Abstract: Many automated manufacturing processes rely on industrial robot arms to move process-specific tools along workpiece surfaces. In applications like grinding, sanding, spray painting, or inspection, they need to cover a workpiece fully while keeping their tools perpendicular to its surface. While there are approaches to generate trajectories for these applications, there are no sufficient methods for analyzing the feasibility of full surface coverage. This work proposes a sampling-based approach for continuous coverage estimation that explores reachable surface regions in the configuration space. We define an extended ambient configuration space that allows for the representation of tool position and orientation constraints. A continuation-based approach is used to explore it using two different sampling strategies. A thorough evaluation across different kinematics and environments analyzes their runtime and efficiency. This validates our ability to accurately and efficiently calculate surface coverage for complex surfaces in complicated environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional planning methods use pre-defined area costs limiting generalization, and struggle to identify passable regions without overestimation in spatially continuous navigation spaces.

Method: Three-component framework: 1) superpixel graph map generation with regional constraints, 2) regional-constraint relaxation using GNN trained on human demonstrations, 3) interleaving relaxation, planning, and execution.

Result: Achieves highest human-likeness score on 2D semantic maps and 3D OpenStreetMap data while maintaining balanced efficiency-safety trade-off. Successfully demonstrated on Spot quadruped robot in real-world urban navigation.

Conclusion: SuReNav provides scalable, generalizable human-like navigation that overcomes limitations of conventional constraint-based planning methods through learned constraint relaxation.

Abstract: We address the over-constrained planning problem in semi-static environments. The planning objective is to find a best-effort solution that avoids all hard constraint regions while minimally traversing the least risky areas. Conventional methods often rely on pre-defined area costs, limiting generalizations. Further, the spatial continuity of navigation spaces makes it difficult to identify regions that are passable without overestimation. To overcome these challenges, we propose SuReNav, a superpixel graph-based constraint relaxation and navigation method that imitates human-like safe and efficient navigation. Our framework consists of three components: 1) superpixel graph map generation with regional constraints, 2) regional-constraint relaxation using graph neural network trained on human demonstrations for safe and efficient navigation, and 3) interleaving relaxation, planning, and execution for complete navigation. We evaluate our method against state-of-the-art baselines on 2D semantic maps and 3D maps from OpenStreetMap, achieving the highest human-likeness score of complete navigation while maintaining a balanced trade-off between efficiency and safety. We finally demonstrate its scalability and generalization performance in real-world urban navigation with a quadruped robot, Spot.

Conclusion: Establishes foundational platform for lightweight, collision-proof FWMAVs bridging biological inspiration with practical robotics, suitable for confined-space inspection and ecological monitoring while providing physical model to decode butterfly flight principles.

Abstract: Flapping-wing micro air vehicles (FWMAVs) have demonstrated remarkable bio-inspired agility, yet tailless two-winged configurations remain largely unexplored due to their complex fluid-structure and wing-body coupling. Here we present \textit{AirPulse}, a 26-gram butterfly-inspired FWMAV that achieves fully onboard, closed-loop, untethered flight without auxiliary control surfaces. The AirPulse robot replicates key biomechanical traits of butterfly flight, including low wing aspect ratio, compliant carbon-fiber-reinforced wings, and low-frequency, high-amplitude flapping that induces cyclic variations in the center of gravity and moment of inertia, producing characteristic body undulation. We establish a quantitative mapping between flapping modulation parameters and force-torque generation, and introduce the Stroke Timing Asymmetry Rhythm (STAR) generator, enabling smooth, stable, and linearly parameterized wingstroke asymmetry for flapping control. Integrating these with an attitude controller, the AirPulse robot maintains pitch and yaw stability despite strong oscillatory dynamics. Free-flight experiments demonstrate stable climbing and turning maneuvers via either angle offset or stroke timing modulation, marking the first onboard controlled flight of the lightest two-winged, tailless butterfly-inspired FWMAV reported in peer-reviewed literature. This work corroborates a foundational platform for lightweight, collision-proof FWMAVs, bridging biological inspiration with practical aerial robotics. Their non-invasive maneuverability is ideally suited for real-world applications, such as confined-space inspection and ecological monitoring, inaccessible to traditional drones, while their biomechanical fidelity provides a physical model to decode the principles underlying the erratic yet efficient flight of real butterflies.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce DynaRetarget, a complete pipeline for retargeting human motions to humanoid control policies. The core component of DynaRetarget is a novel Sampling-Based Trajectory Optimization (SBTO) framework that refines imperfect kinematic trajectories into dynamically feasible motions. SBTO incrementally advances the optimization horizon, enabling optimization over the entire trajectory for long-horizon tasks. We validate DynaRetarget by successfully retargeting hundreds of humanoid-object demonstrations and achieving higher success rates than the state of the art. The framework also generalizes across varying object properties, such as mass, size, and geometry, using the same tracking objective. This ability to robustly retarget diverse demonstrations opens the door to generating large-scale synthetic datasets of humanoid loco-manipulation trajectories, addressing a major bottleneck in real-world data collection.

*Allen Tao,Jun Yang,Stanko Oparnica,Wenjie Xue*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes a closed-loop visual servoing method for textureless objects using learning-based keypoint detection with EKF pose estimation and probabilistic control for robustness under adverse conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual servoing struggles with textureless objects due to lack of reliable visual features, and adverse conditions like occlusions corrupt visual feedback, reducing accuracy and stability.

Method: Uses learning-based keypoint detection for textureless objects, integrates perception and control via Extended Kalman Filter for 6D pose estimation, and implements probabilistic control law that computes both camera velocity and uncertainty for uncertainty-aware operation.

Result: Method outperforms traditional visual servoing techniques in accuracy and practical application, validated on real-world robotic platforms with quantitative metrics and grasping experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed closed-loop integration of perception and control with uncertainty-aware probabilistic control enables robust visual servoing for textureless objects under adverse conditions.

Abstract: Visual servoing is fundamental to robotic applications, enabling precise positioning and control. However, applying it to textureless objects remains a challenge due to the absence of reliable visual features. Moreover, adverse visual conditions, such as occlusions, often corrupt visual feedback, leading to reduced accuracy and instability in visual servoing. In this work, we build upon learning-based keypoint detection for textureless objects and propose a method that enhances robustness by tightly integrating perception and control in a closed loop. Specifically, we employ an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) that integrates per-frame keypoint measurements to estimate 6D object pose, which drives pose-based visual servoing (PBVS) for control. The resulting camera motion, in turn, enhances the tracking of subsequent keypoints, effectively closing the perception-control loop. Additionally, unlike standard PBVS, we propose a probabilistic control law that computes both camera velocity and its associated uncertainty, enabling uncertainty-aware control for safe and reliable operation. We validate our approach on real-world robotic platforms using quantitative metrics and grasping experiments, demonstrating that our method outperforms traditional visual servoing techniques in both accuracy and practical application.

TL;DR: SURE is a robust trajectory optimization framework that handles contact timing uncertainty by allowing multiple trajectories to branch from possible pre-impact states and later rejoin, improving robustness in contact-rich robotic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic tasks with contact interactions face challenges due to discontinuous dynamics. Conventional trajectory optimization assumes deterministic contact events, limiting robustness and adaptability in real-world settings with uncertain contact timing.

Method: SURE framework explicitly accounts for contact timing uncertainty by allowing multiple trajectories to branch from possible pre-impact states and later rejoin a shared trajectory, achieving both robustness and computational efficiency within unified optimization.

Result: In cart-pole balancing with uncertain wall location: 21.6% average improvement in success rate when branch switching enabled. In robotic manipulator egg-catching: 40% improvement in success rate.

Conclusion: SURE substantially enhances robustness compared to conventional nominal formulations for trajectory optimization in contact-rich robotic tasks with uncertain impact times.

Abstract: Robotic tasks involving contact interactions pose significant challenges for trajectory optimization due to discontinuous dynamics. Conventional formulations typically assume deterministic contact events, which limit robustness and adaptability in real-world settings. In this work, we propose SURE, a robust trajectory optimization framework that explicitly accounts for contact timing uncertainty. By allowing multiple trajectories to branch from possible pre-impact states and later rejoin a shared trajectory, SURE achieves both robustness and computational efficiency within a unified optimization framework. We evaluate SURE on two representative tasks with unknown impact times. In a cart-pole balancing task involving uncertain wall location, SURE achieves an average improvement of 21.6% in success rate when branch switching is enabled during control. In an egg-catching experiment using a robotic manipulator, SURE improves the success rate by 40%. These results demonstrate that SURE substantially enhances robustness compared to conventional nominal formulations.

*Xudong Sun,Armand Jordana,Massimo Fornasier,Jalal Etesami,Majid Khadiv*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CBO (consensus-based optimization) applied to robotics trajectory optimization, showing global convergence guarantees and outperforming existing local methods like MPPI, CEM, and CMA-ES on challenging problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing zero-order optimization methods for robotics (MPPI, CEM, CMA-ES) are local in nature and rely on gradient estimation, lacking global convergence guarantees. There's a need for methods that can provably converge to global optima for challenging robotics trajectory optimization problems.

Method: Introduces consensus-based optimization (CBO) to robotics, which is a global optimization method with theoretical convergence guarantees. The method is applied to three challenging trajectory optimization scenarios: long-horizon problems for simple systems, dynamic balance for highly underactuated systems, and high-dimensional problems with only terminal cost.

Result: CBO achieves lower costs compared to existing methods (MPPI, CEM, CMA-ES) on all three challenging settings: long-horizon problems, dynamic balance for underactuated systems, and high-dimensional terminal cost problems.

Conclusion: CBO provides a new framework for studying global trajectory optimization in robotics, offering theoretical global convergence guarantees and practical performance advantages over existing local optimization methods on challenging problems.

Abstract: Zero-order optimization has recently received significant attention for designing optimal trajectories and policies for robotic systems. However, most existing methods (e.g., MPPI, CEM, and CMA-ES) are local in nature, as they rely on gradient estimation. In this paper, we introduce consensus-based optimization (CBO) to robotics, which is guaranteed to converge to a global optimum under mild assumptions. We provide theoretical analysis and illustrative examples that give intuition into the fundamental differences between CBO and existing methods. To demonstrate the scalability of CBO for robotics problems, we consider three challenging trajectory optimization scenarios: (1) a long-horizon problem for a simple system, (2) a dynamic balance problem for a highly underactuated system, and (3) a high-dimensional problem with only a terminal cost. Our results show that CBO is able to achieve lower costs with respect to existing methods on all three challenging settings. This opens a new framework to study global trajectory optimization in robotics.

*Andrei-Carlo Papuc,Lasse Peters,Sihao Sun,Laura Ferranti,Javier Alonso-Mora*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LMPG (Learned Model Predictive Game) outperforms both MPG and MPC in drone racing by amortizing gameplay to reduce latency while maintaining interaction awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous drone racing requires both high-speed navigation and strategic decision-making against competitors. The paper investigates the trade-off between deep strategic planning (MPG) with high latency versus fast but interaction-unaware planning (MPC).

Method: Proposes Learned Model Predictive Game (LMPG) that amortizes model predictive gameplay to reduce latency while maintaining interaction awareness. Compares MPG (interaction-aware but slow) and MPC (fast but interaction-unaware) paradigms.

Result: MPG outperforms MPC at moderate velocities but loses advantage at higher speeds due to latency. LMPG outperforms both MPG and MPC in head-to-head races in both simulation and hardware experiments.

Conclusion: LMPG effectively addresses the latency limitation of MPG while maintaining strategic interaction awareness, making it superior for high-speed autonomous drone racing against competitors.

Abstract: Autonomous drone racing pushes the boundaries of high-speed motion planning and multi-agent strategic decision-making. Success in this domain requires drones not only to navigate at their limits but also to anticipate and counteract competitors' actions. In this paper, we study a fundamental question that arises in this domain: how deeply should an agent strategize before taking an action? To this end, we compare two planning paradigms: the Model Predictive Game (MPG), which finds interaction-aware strategies at the expense of longer computation times, and contouring Model Predictive Control (MPC), which computes strategies rapidly but does not reason about interactions. We perform extensive experiments to study this trade-off, revealing that MPG outperforms MPC at moderate velocities but loses its advantage at higher speeds due to latency. To address this shortcoming, we propose a Learned Model Predictive Game (LMPG) approach that amortizes model predictive gameplay to reduce latency. In both simulation and hardware experiments, we benchmark our approach against MPG and MPC in head-to-head races, finding that LMPG outperforms both baselines.

Abstract: Being able to simulate the outcomes of actions in varied environments will revolutionize the development of generalist agents at scale. However, modeling these world dynamics, especially for dexterous robotics tasks, poses significant challenges due to limited data coverage and scarce action labels. As an endeavor towards this end, we introduce DreamDojo, a foundation world model that learns diverse interactions and dexterous controls from 44k hours of egocentric human videos. Our data mixture represents the largest video dataset to date for world model pretraining, spanning a wide range of daily scenarios with diverse objects and skills. To address the scarcity of action labels, we introduce continuous latent actions as unified proxy actions, enhancing interaction knowledge transfer from unlabeled videos. After post-training on small-scale target robot data, DreamDojo demonstrates a strong understanding of physics and precise action controllability. We also devise a distillation pipeline that accelerates DreamDojo to a real-time speed of 10.81 FPS and further improves context consistency. Our work enables several important applications based on generative world models, including live teleoperation, policy evaluation, and model-based planning. Systematic evaluation on multiple challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks verifies the significance of our method for simulating open-world, contact-rich tasks, paving the way for general-purpose robot world models.
