### [1] [Diagnosing Bottlenecks in Data Visualization Understanding by Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21740)
*Alexa R. Tartaglini,Satchel Grant,Daniel Wurgaft,Christopher Potts,Judith E. Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FUGU is a diagnostic suite that reveals vision-language models struggle with data visualization understanding primarily due to vision-language handoff failures, not visual encoding limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs perform poorly on data visualization tasks, but the specific causes of failure (visual encoding, vision-language transfer, or language processing) remain unclear and need systematic investigation.

Method: Developed FUGU diagnostic tasks to test specific visualization skills, used activation patching and linear probes to trace information flow, and tested three VLMs with various prompting strategies including coordinate provision.

Result: VLMs fail to generate correct data point coordinates, but correct coordinates exist in vision encoder representations. Providing coordinates improves single-point tasks but worsens statistical relationship tasks. Fine-tuning doesn't achieve ceiling performance.

Conclusion: Current VLM architectures have fundamental constraints in vision-language handoff that limit reliable data visualization understanding, suggesting architectural improvements are needed beyond fine-tuning.

Abstract: Data visualizations are vital components of many scientific articles and news
stories. Current vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle on basic data
visualization understanding tasks, but the causes of failure remain unclear.
Are VLM failures attributable to limitations in how visual information in the
data visualization is encoded, how information is transferred between the
vision and language modules, or how information is processed within the
language module? We developed FUGU, a suite of data visualization understanding
tasks, to precisely characterize potential sources of difficulty (e.g.,
extracting the position of data points, distances between them, and other
summary statistics). We used FUGU to investigate three widely used VLMs. To
diagnose the sources of errors produced by these models, we used activation
patching and linear probes to trace information flow through models across a
variety of prompting strategies. We found that some models fail to generate the
coordinates of individual data points correctly, and these initial errors often
lead to erroneous final responses. When these models are provided with the
correct coordinates, performance improves substantially. Moreover, even when
the model generates an incorrect response, the correct coordinates can be
successfully read out from the latent representations in the vision encoder,
suggesting that the source of these errors lies in the vision-language handoff.
We further found that while providing correct coordinates helps with tasks
involving one or a small number of data points, it generally worsens
performance for tasks that require extracting statistical relationships across
many data points. Fine-tuning models on FUGU also fails to yield ceiling
performance. These findings point to architectural constraints in current VLMs
that might pose significant challenges for reliable data visualization
understanding.

### [2] [Agro-Consensus: Semantic Self-Consistency in Vision-Language Models for Crop Disease Management in Developing Countries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21757)
*Mihir Gupta,Pratik Desai,Ross Greer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A cost-effective self-consistency framework improves vision-language model reliability for agricultural disease diagnosis by using semantic clustering and consensus selection from multiple candidate responses, achieving up to 94% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agricultural disease management in developing countries faces challenges including limited expert access, unreliable internet, and cost constraints that hinder large-scale AI deployment.

Method: Uses semantic clustering with a lightweight embedding model to group candidate responses, then selects the most coherent caption through cosine similarity-based consensus. Incorporates human-in-the-loop crop type confirmation to filter errors.

Result: Achieved 83.1% accuracy with 10 candidate generations (vs 77.5% baseline) and 94.0% accuracy when correct response is in top four clusters (vs 88.5% baseline), tested on PlantVillage dataset with fine-tuned PaliGemma model.

Conclusion: The framework provides a cost-effective solution for improving VLM reliability in agricultural applications, particularly suitable for resource-constrained environments in developing countries.

Abstract: Agricultural disease management in developing countries such as India, Kenya,
and Nigeria faces significant challenges due to limited access to expert plant
pathologists, unreliable internet connectivity, and cost constraints that
hinder the deployment of large-scale AI systems. This work introduces a
cost-effective self-consistency framework to improve vision-language model
(VLM) reliability for agricultural image captioning. The proposed method
employs semantic clustering, using a lightweight (80MB) pre-trained embedding
model to group multiple candidate responses. It then selects the most coherent
caption -- containing a diagnosis, symptoms, analysis, treatment, and
prevention recommendations -- through a cosine similarity-based consensus. A
practical human-in-the-loop (HITL) component is incorporated, wherein user
confirmation of the crop type filters erroneous generations, ensuring
higher-quality input for the consensus mechanism. Applied to the publicly
available PlantVillage dataset using a fine-tuned 3B-parameter PaliGemma model,
our framework demonstrates improvements over standard decoding methods.
Evaluated on 800 crop disease images with up to 21 generations per image, our
single-cluster consensus method achieves a peak accuracy of 83.1% with 10
candidate generations, compared to the 77.5% baseline accuracy of greedy
decoding. The framework's effectiveness is further demonstrated when
considering multiple clusters; accuracy rises to 94.0% when a correct response
is found within any of the top four candidate clusters, outperforming the 88.5%
achieved by a top-4 selection from the baseline.

### [3] [Proportion and Perspective Control for Flow-Based Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21763)
*Julien Boudier,Hugo Caselles-Dupré*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces two specialized ControlNets for artistic control in text-to-image generation: a proportion ControlNet using bounding boxes for object positioning/scaling, and a perspective ControlNet using vanishing lines for 3D scene geometry control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern text-to-image diffusion models generate high-fidelity images but offer limited control over spatial and geometric structure, which is crucial for artistic applications.

Method: Developed two ControlNets: (1) proportion ControlNet using bounding boxes for object position and scale control, (2) perspective ControlNet using vanishing lines for 3D geometry control. Supported training with data pipelines using vision-language models for annotation and specialized algorithms for conditioning image synthesis.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that both modules provide effective control over spatial and geometric structure, though they exhibit limitations when dealing with complex constraints.

Conclusion: The two specialized ControlNets successfully address the spatial and geometric control limitations in text-to-image generation, providing artists with enhanced creative control, and both models are publicly released on HuggingFace.

Abstract: While modern text-to-image diffusion models generate high-fidelity images,
they offer limited control over the spatial and geometric structure of the
output. To address this, we introduce and evaluate two ControlNets specialized
for artistic control: (1) a proportion ControlNet that uses bounding boxes to
dictate the position and scale of objects, and (2) a perspective ControlNet
that employs vanishing lines to control the 3D geometry of the scene. We
support the training of these modules with data pipelines that leverage
vision-language models for annotation and specialized algorithms for
conditioning image synthesis. Our experiments demonstrate that both modules
provide effective control but exhibit limitations with complex constraints.
Both models are released on HuggingFace:

### [4] [H2OFlow: Grounding Human-Object Affordances with 3D Generative Models and Dense Diffused Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21769)
*Harry Zhang,Luca Carlone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: H2OFlow is a novel framework that learns comprehensive 3D human-object interaction affordances (contact, orientation, spatial occupancy) using only synthetic data from 3D generative models, eliminating the need for labor-intensive human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for 3D affordance understanding rely on expensive hand-labeled datasets and are limited to contact-based analysis, ignoring important aspects like orientation preferences and spatial occupancy patterns in human-object interactions.

Method: H2OFlow uses a dense 3D-flow-based representation learned through a dense diffusion process on point clouds, trained exclusively on synthetic data generated from 3D generative models.

Result: The framework effectively generalizes to real-world objects and outperforms prior methods that depend on manual annotations or mesh-based representations in modeling 3D affordance.

Conclusion: H2OFlow demonstrates that comprehensive 3D human-object interaction affordances can be learned using synthetic data alone, providing a scalable alternative to annotation-intensive approaches while capturing richer interaction aspects beyond just contact.

Abstract: Understanding how humans interact with the surrounding environment, and
specifically reasoning about object interactions and affordances, is a critical
challenge in computer vision, robotics, and AI. Current approaches often depend
on labor-intensive, hand-labeled datasets capturing real-world or simulated
human-object interaction (HOI) tasks, which are costly and time-consuming to
produce. Furthermore, most existing methods for 3D affordance understanding are
limited to contact-based analysis, neglecting other essential aspects of
human-object interactions, such as orientation (\eg, humans might have a
preferential orientation with respect certain objects, such as a TV) and
spatial occupancy (\eg, humans are more likely to occupy certain regions around
an object, like the front of a microwave rather than its back). To address
these limitations, we introduce \emph{H2OFlow}, a novel framework that
comprehensively learns 3D HOI affordances -- encompassing contact, orientation,
and spatial occupancy -- using only synthetic data generated from 3D generative
models. H2OFlow employs a dense 3D-flow-based representation, learned through a
dense diffusion process operating on point clouds. This learned flow enables
the discovery of rich 3D affordances without the need for human annotations.
Through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that
H2OFlow generalizes effectively to real-world objects and surpasses prior
methods that rely on manual annotations or mesh-based representations in
modeling 3D affordance.

### [6] [Face-MakeUpV2: Facial Consistency Learning for Controllable Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21775)
*Dawei Dai,Yinxiu Zhou,Chenghang Li,Guolai Jiang,Chengfang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Face-MakeUpV2 is a facial image generation model that addresses facial attribute leakage and physical consistency issues in text-to-image models by using a large dataset with spatial supervision, dual facial information injection channels, and optimization objectives for semantic alignment and ID preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models suffer from facial attribute leakage and insufficient physical consistency when responding to local semantic instructions, which limits their reliability for facial editing applications.

Method: 1) Constructed FaceCaptionMask-1M dataset with 1M image-text-mask pairs for spatial supervision; 2) Used pretrained text-to-image model as backbone with two facial injection channels (3D facial rendering for physical characteristics and global facial features); 3) Implemented optimization objectives including semantic alignment and perceptual loss.

Result: Extensive experiments showed Face-MakeUpV2 achieves best overall performance in preserving face ID and maintaining physical consistency of reference images.

Conclusion: Face-MakeUpV2 demonstrates practical potential for reliable and controllable facial editing in diverse applications by effectively addressing attribute leakage and physical consistency issues.

Abstract: In facial image generation, current text-to-image models often suffer from
facial attribute leakage and insufficient physical consistency when responding
to local semantic instructions. In this study, we propose Face-MakeUpV2, a
facial image generation model that aims to maintain the consistency of face ID
and physical characteristics with the reference image. First, we constructed a
large-scale dataset FaceCaptionMask-1M comprising approximately one million
image-text-masks pairs that provide precise spatial supervision for the local
semantic instructions. Second, we employed a general text-to-image pretrained
model as the backbone and introduced two complementary facial information
injection channels: a 3D facial rendering channel to incorporate the physical
characteristics of the image and a global facial feature channel. Third, we
formulated two optimization objectives for the supervised learning of our
model: semantic alignment in the model's embedding space to mitigate the
attribute leakage problem and perceptual loss on facial images to preserve ID
consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our Face-MakeUpV2 achieves
best overall performance in terms of preserving face ID and maintaining
physical consistency of the reference images. These results highlight the
practical potential of Face-MakeUpV2 for reliable and controllable facial
editing in diverse applications.

### [7] [Ageing Drift in Binary Face Templates: A Bits-per-Decade Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21778)
*Abdelilah Ganmati,Karim Afdel,Lahcen Koutti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper studies the longitudinal stability of compact binary face templates, quantifying aging drift in bits per decade. Using PCA-ITQ compression on CNN embeddings, they find systematic increases in intra-class Hamming distance over time, with shorter codes being more age-stable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify how face recognition templates age over time, particularly for applications like smart-card and match-on-card deployments where template stability is crucial for long-term performance.

Method: Float embeddings from a modern face CNN are compressed with PCA-ITQ into 64- and 128-bit codes. For each identity in AgeDB with at least three distinct ages, genuine pairs are formed and per-identity linear models of Hamming distance versus absolute age gap are fitted.

Result: Across 566 identities, median slopes are 1.357 bits per decade for 64-bit templates and 2.571 bits per decade for 128-bit templates. The distributions are predominantly positive, indicating systematic increase in intra-class distance over time. Shorter codes are more age-stable at fixed decision thresholds.

Conclusion: Face templates experience measurable aging drift that scales with code length. The findings have implications for practical deployments, suggesting mitigations like periodic re-enrollment and targeted parity on unstable bit positions.

Abstract: We study the longitudinal stability of compact binary face templates and
quantify ageing drift directly in bits per decade. Float embeddings from a
modern face CNN are compressed with PCA-ITQ into 64- and 128-bit codes. For
each identity in AgeDB with at least three distinct ages, we form all genuine
pairs and fit a per-identity linear model of Hamming distance versus absolute
age gap. Across 566 identities, the median slope is 1.357 bits per decade for
64-bit templates and 2.571 bits per decade for 128-bit templates, with tight
non-parametric 95 percent bootstrap confidence intervals. The distributions are
predominantly positive, indicating a small but systematic increase in
intra-class distance over time. Because drift scales with code length, shorter
codes are inherently more age-stable at a fixed decision threshold. We connect
these slopes to operating characteristics by reporting EER and TPR at FAR = 1
percent in three age bins. We discuss implications for smart-card and
match-on-card deployments, including simple mitigations such as periodic
re-enrolment and targeted parity on empirically unstable bit positions. Code
and CSV artifacts are provided to support reproducibility.

### [8] [Bridging Accuracy and Interpretability: Deep Learning with XAI for Breast Cancer Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21780)
*Bishal Chhetri,B. V. Rathish Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An interpretable deep learning framework achieves state-of-the-art breast cancer detection from FNA images with 99.2% accuracy, enhanced by SHAP and LIME explanations to identify concave points as the most influential feature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an interpretable deep learning system for early breast cancer detection that combines high predictive accuracy with explainability for clinical adoption, addressing the black-box nature of traditional deep learning models.

Method: Deep neural network with ReLU activations, Adam optimizer, and binary cross-entropy loss, trained on quantitative features from digitized FNA images. Model-agnostic Explainable AI techniques (SHAP and LIME) were incorporated for feature-level attributions and visualizations.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance: accuracy 0.992, precision 1.000, recall 0.977, F1 score 0.988. Outperformed established algorithms (logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, SGD, KNN, XGBoost). Identified concave points as the most influential feature.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges performance and interpretability for clinical use, with concave points feature providing key insights for improving breast cancer diagnosis and treatment.

Abstract: In this study, we present an interpretable deep learning framework for the
early detection of breast cancer using quantitative features extracted from
digitized fine needle aspirate (FNA) images of breast masses. Our deep neural
network, using ReLU activations, the Adam optimizer, and a binary cross-entropy
loss, delivers state-of-the-art classification performance, achieving an
accuracy of 0.992, precision of 1.000, recall of 0.977, and an F1 score of
0.988. These results substantially exceed the benchmarks reported in the
literature. We evaluated the model under identical protocols against a suite of
well-established algorithms (logistic regression, decision trees, random
forests, stochastic gradient descent, K-nearest neighbors, and XGBoost) and
found the deep model consistently superior on the same metrics. Recognizing
that high predictive accuracy alone is insufficient for clinical adoption due
to the black-box nature of deep learning models, we incorporated model-agnostic
Explainable AI techniques such as SHAP and LIME to produce feature-level
attributions and human-readable visualizations. These explanations quantify the
contribution of each feature to individual predictions, support error analysis,
and increase clinician trust, thus bridging the gap between performance and
interpretability for real-world clinical use. The concave points feature of the
cell nuclei is found to be the most influential feature positively impacting
the classification task. This insight can be very helpful in improving the
diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer by highlighting the key
characteristics of breast tumor.

### [9] [EdgeSync: Accelerating Edge-Model Updates for Data Drift through Adaptive Continuous Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21781)
*Runchu Donga,Peng Zhao,Guiqin Wang,Nan Qi,Jie Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EdgeSync is an efficient edge-model updating approach that improves real-time video analytics by enhancing sample filtering with timeliness and inference results, and optimizing update timing to address compute-intensive retraining and data distribution misalignment issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time video analytics systems face accuracy degradation due to changing data distributions over time (e.g., lighting, weather conditions). Existing cloud-assisted retraining methods suffer from compute-intensive delays and poor alignment with evolving video stream distributions.

Method: EdgeSync introduces enhanced sample filtering incorporating timeliness and inference results to ensure training relevance, plus a dynamic training management module that optimizes update timing and sequencing.

Result: Evaluations on diverse real-world datasets show EdgeSync improves accuracy by approximately 3.4% compared to existing methods and about 10% compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: EdgeSync effectively addresses key challenges in edge-model updating by ensuring timely, relevant updates that maintain accuracy in dynamic video analytics environments.

Abstract: Real-time video analytics systems typically deploy lightweight models on edge
devices to reduce latency. However, the distribution of data features may
change over time due to various factors such as changing lighting and weather
conditions, leading to decreased model accuracy. Recent frameworks try to
address this issue by leveraging remote servers to continuously train and adapt
lightweight edge models using more complex models in the cloud. Despite these
advancements, existing methods face two key challenges: first, the retraining
process is compute-intensive, causing significant delays in model updates;
second, the new model may not align well with the evolving data distribution of
the current video stream. To address these challenges, we introduce EdgeSync,
an efficient edge-model updating approach that enhances sample filtering by
incorporating timeliness and inference results, thus ensuring training samples
are more relevant to the current video content while reducing update delays.
Additionally, EdgeSync features a dynamic training management module that
optimizes the timing and sequencing of model updates to improve their
timeliness. Evaluations on diverse and complex real-world datasets demonstrate
that EdgeSync improves accuracy by approximately 3.4% compared to existing
methods and by about 10% compared to traditional approaches.

### [10] [Promptable Fire Segmentation: Unleashing SAM2's Potential for Real-Time Mobile Deployment with Strategic Bounding Box Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21782)
*Emmanuel U. Ugwu,Zhang Xinming*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of SAM2 variants for fire segmentation, showing that bounding box prompts (especially Box+MP) achieve the best performance while lightweight variants like TinySAM and MobileSAM are suitable for edge deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fire segmentation is challenging due to flames' irregular boundaries and variable intensities. While SAM models have shown cross-domain generalization, their effectiveness for fire segmentation under mobile constraints remains unexplored.

Method: Systematically evaluated four SAM2.1 variants and mobile-oriented variants across three fire datasets using multiple prompting strategies: automatic, single/multiple points, bounding boxes, and hybrid approaches.

Result: Bounding box prompts consistently outperformed other methods, with Box+MP achieving highest mean IoU (0.64) and Dice coefficient (0.75). Lightweight variants significantly reduced memory and computational costs for edge deployment.

Conclusion: This work provides critical insights for deploying promptable segmentation models in fire monitoring systems and establishes benchmarks for domain-specific SAM applications, with lightweight variants being suitable for latency-tolerant edge scenarios.

Abstract: Fire segmentation remains a critical challenge in computer vision due to
flames' irregular boundaries, translucent edges, and highly variable
intensities. While the Segment Anything Models (SAM and SAM2) have demonstrated
impressive cross-domain generalization capabilities, their effectiveness in
fire segmentation -- particularly under mobile deployment constraints --
remains largely unexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive
evaluation of SAM2 variants for fire segmentation, focusing on bounding box
prompting strategies to enhance deployment feasibility. We systematically
evaluate four SAM2.1 variants (tiny, small, base_plus, large) alongside
mobile-oriented variants (TinySAM, MobileSAM) across three fire datasets using
multiple prompting strategies: automatic, single positive point (SP), single
positive point + single negative point (SP+SN), multiple positive points (MP),
bounding box (Box), and hybrid variants (Box+SP and Box+MP). Our experimental
results demonstrate that bounding box prompts consistently outperform automatic
and single point-based approaches, with Box+MP achieving the highest mean IoU
(0.64) and Dice coefficient (0.75) on the Khan dataset. Lightweight variants
such as TinySAM and MobileSAM further reduce memory and computational costs,
making them more suitable for latency-tolerant edge scenarios. Overall, this
work provides critical insights for deploying promptable segmentation models in
fire monitoring systems and establishes benchmarks for future research in
domain-specific SAM applications. Code is available at:

### [11] [Noise Aggregation Analysis Driven by Small-Noise Injection: Efficient Membership Inference for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21783)
*Guo Li,Yuyang Yu,Xuemiao Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an efficient membership inference attack method against diffusion models by injecting slight noise and analyzing the aggregation degree of predicted noise distribution to distinguish between training and non-training samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models like Stable Diffusion pose privacy risks, particularly membership inference attacks that determine if specific data was used in training. Existing methods require many model visits, so an efficient approach is needed.

Method: Inject slight noise into test images and analyze the aggregation degree of noise distribution predicted by the model. Member images show higher noise aggregation around certain time steps, while non-member images exhibit more discrete noise patterns.

Result: Achieves superior performance across multiple datasets with fewer model visits. Shows better attack effects in ASR and AUC when attacking large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating scalability.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively performs membership inference attacks on diffusion models with high efficiency and scalability, requiring fewer model interactions while maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated powerful performance in generating
high-quality images. A typical example is text-to-image generator like Stable
Diffusion. However, their widespread use also poses potential privacy risks. A
key concern is membership inference attacks, which attempt to determine whether
a particular data sample was used in the model training process. We propose an
efficient membership inference attack method against diffusion models. This
method is based on the injection of slight noise and the evaluation of the
aggregation degree of the noise distribution. The intuition is that the noise
prediction patterns of diffusion models for training set samples and
non-training set samples exhibit distinguishable differences.Specifically, we
suppose that member images exhibit higher aggregation of predicted noise around
a certain time step of the diffusion process. In contrast, the predicted noises
of non-member images exhibit a more discrete characteristic around the certain
time step. Compared with other existing methods, our proposed method requires
fewer visits to the target diffusion model. We inject slight noise into the
image under test and then determine its membership by analyzing the aggregation
degree of the noise distribution predicted by the model. Empirical findings
indicate that our method achieves superior performance across multiple
datasets. At the same time, our method can also show better attack effects in
ASR and AUC when facing large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, proving the
scalability of our method.

### [12] [Multi-Agent Pose Uncertainty: A Differentiable Rendering Cramér-Rao Bound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21785)
*Arun Muthukkumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Derives a closed-form lower bound on camera pose covariance by treating differentiable renderers as measurement functions, extending classical bundle adjustment uncertainty to learned models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pose estimation is essential but lacks rigorous uncertainty quantification under dense or learned models, limiting applications in computer vision and robotics.

Method: Linearizes image formation with respect to small pose perturbations on the manifold, treating differentiable renderers as measurement functions to derive a render-aware Cramér-Rao bound.

Result: Provides a statistical formulation that reduces to classical bundle-adjustment uncertainty and naturally extends to multi-agent settings by fusing Fisher information across cameras.

Conclusion: Enables downstream applications like cooperative perception and novel view synthesis without requiring explicit keypoint correspondences, bridging classical vision theory with modern differentiable rendering approaches.

Abstract: Pose estimation is essential for many applications within computer vision and
robotics. Despite its uses, few works provide rigorous uncertainty
quantification for poses under dense or learned models. We derive a closed-form
lower bound on the covariance of camera pose estimates by treating a
differentiable renderer as a measurement function. Linearizing image formation
with respect to a small pose perturbation on the manifold yields a render-aware
Cram\'er-Rao bound. Our approach reduces to classical bundle-adjustment
uncertainty, ensuring continuity with vision theory. It also naturally extends
to multi-agent settings by fusing Fisher information across cameras. Our
statistical formulation has downstream applications for tasks such as
cooperative perception and novel view synthesis without requiring explicit
keypoint correspondences.

### [13] [EventFormer: A Node-graph Hierarchical Attention Transformer for Action-centric Video Event Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21786)
*Qile Su,Shoutai Zhu,Shuai Zhang,Baoyu Liang,Chao Tong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AVEP (Action-centric Video Event Prediction), a new task for predicting subsequent events in videos using complex logic and semantic information, along with a large annotated dataset and EventFormer model that outperforms existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human events are mostly recorded in videos rather than scripts, but there's a lack of related research in vision. Existing video prediction tasks don't incorporate complex logic and rich semantic information needed for event prediction.

Method: Created AVEP dataset with 35K annotated videos and 178K video clips with fine-grained multimodal event argument nodes. Proposed EventFormer, a node-graph hierarchical attention model that captures relationships between events and arguments and coreference relationships.

Result: Experiments showed AVEP's complexity and dataset value. EventFormer outperformed SOTA video prediction models and LVLMs on the AVEP task.

Conclusion: AVEP addresses the gap in video event prediction with complex logic and semantics. The dataset and EventFormer model provide effective solutions, demonstrating superiority over existing approaches.

Abstract: Script event induction, which aims to predict the subsequent event based on
the context, is a challenging task in NLP, achieving remarkable success in
practical applications. However, human events are mostly recorded and presented
in the form of videos rather than scripts, yet there is a lack of related
research in the realm of vision. To address this problem, we introduce AVEP
(Action-centric Video Event Prediction), a task that distinguishes itself from
existing video prediction tasks through its incorporation of more complex logic
and richer semantic information. We present a large structured dataset, which
consists of about $35K$ annotated videos and more than $178K$ video clips of
event, built upon existing video event datasets to support this task. The
dataset offers more fine-grained annotations, where the atomic unit is
represented as a multimodal event argument node, providing better structured
representations of video events. Due to the complexity of event structures,
traditional visual models that take patches or frames as input are not
well-suited for AVEP. We propose EventFormer, a node-graph hierarchical
attention based video event prediction model, which can capture both the
relationships between events and their arguments and the coreferencial
relationships between arguments. We conducted experiments using several SOTA
video prediction models as well as LVLMs on AVEP, demonstrating both the
complexity of the task and the value of the dataset. Our approach outperforms
all these video prediction models. We will release the dataset and code for
replicating the experiments and annotations.

### [14] [Mismatch reconstruction theory for unknown measurement matrix in imaging through multimode fiber bending](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21787)
*Le Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel mismatch reconstruction theory for multimode fiber imaging when measurement matrix is unknown, with algorithms to construct new measurement matrices and proven robustness under low noise conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reconstruction algorithms fail when measurement matrix is unknown due to system configuration issues or fiber bending, preventing practical multimode fiber imaging applications.

Method: Proposed mismatch equation with matched and calibration solution algorithms to construct new measurement matrices, with detailed mathematical proofs provided.

Result: Under low noise levels, constructed matrices enable successful image reconstruction using traditional algorithms, with demonstrated robustness against noise, computational precision, and orthogonality issues.

Conclusion: The theory provides a practical solution for unknown measurement matrix scenarios in multimode fiber imaging, with limitations discussed and code made publicly available.

Abstract: Multimode fiber imaging requires strict matching between measurement value
and measurement matrix to achieve image reconstruction. However, in practical
applications, the measurement matrix often cannot be obtained due to unknown
system configuration or difficulty in real-time alignment after arbitrary fiber
bending, resulting in the failure of traditional reconstruction algorithms.
This paper presents a novel mismatch reconstruction theory for solving the
problem of image reconstruction when measurement matrix is unknown. We first
propose mismatch equation and design matched and calibration solution
algorithms to construct a new measurement matrix. In addition, we also provide
a detailed proof of these equations and algorithms in the appendix. The
experimental results show that under low noise levels, constructed matrix can
be used for matched pair in traditional reconstruction algorithms, and
reconstruct the original image successfully. Then, we analyze the impact of
noise, computational precision and orthogonality on reconstruction performance.
The results show that proposed algorithms have a certain degree of robustness.
Finally, we discuss the limitations and potential applications of this theory.

Abstract: Data fusion is an essential task in various domains, enabling the integration
of multi-source information to enhance data quality and insights. One key
application is in satellite remote sensing, where fusing multi-sensor
observations can improve spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, we
explore the design space of diffusion and flow models for data fusion, focusing
on the integration of Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational
Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite
(VIIRS) nighttime lights data. Our approach leverages a diverse set of 2D
image-to-image generative models, including UNET, diffusion, and flow modeling
architectures. We evaluate the effectiveness of these architectures in
satellite remote sensing data fusion, identifying diffusion models based on
UNet as particularly adept at preserving fine-grained spatial details and
generating high-fidelity fused images. We also provide guidance on the
selection of noise schedulers in diffusion-based models, highlighting the
trade-offs between iterative solvers for faster inference and discrete
schedulers for higher-quality reconstructions. Additionally, we explore
quantization techniques to optimize memory efficiency and computational cost
without compromising performance. Our findings offer practical insights into
selecting the most effective diffusion and flow model architectures for data
fusion tasks, particularly in remote sensing applications, and provide
recommendations for leveraging noise scheduling strategies to enhance fusion
quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAFR is an unsupervised framework that fuses RGB images and point clouds using attention-driven fusion to detect industrial anomalies through reconstruction errors, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial anomaly detection benefits from 2D and 3D data integration, but robust cross-modal fusion remains challenging, motivating the development of a principled fusion approach.

Method: Uses shared fusion encoder to create unified latent space from RGB and point clouds, followed by attention-guided modality-specific decoders. Anomalies are detected by measuring reconstruction errors between input and restored features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results with mean I-AUROC of 0.972 on MVTec 3D-AD and 0.901 on Eyecandies benchmarks, with strong few-shot learning performance.

Conclusion: MAFR provides a principled approach for fusing visual and geometric information, advancing the robustness and accuracy of industrial anomaly detection.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) increasingly benefits from integrating 2D
and 3D data, but robust cross-modal fusion remains challenging. We propose a
novel unsupervised framework, Multi-Modal Attention-Driven Fusion Restoration
(MAFR), which synthesises a unified latent space from RGB images and point
clouds using a shared fusion encoder, followed by attention-guided,
modality-specific decoders. Anomalies are localised by measuring reconstruction
errors between input features and their restored counterparts. Evaluations on
the MVTec 3D-AD and Eyecandies benchmarks demonstrate that MAFR achieves
state-of-the-art results, with a mean I-AUROC of 0.972 and 0.901, respectively.
The framework also exhibits strong performance in few-shot learning settings,
and ablation studies confirm the critical roles of the fusion architecture and
composite loss. MAFR offers a principled approach for fusing visual and
geometric information, advancing the robustness and accuracy of industrial
anomaly detection. Code is available at https://github.com/adabrh/MAFR

*Kejia Chen,Jiawen Zhang,Jiacong Hu,Kewei Gao,Jian Lou,Zunlei Feng,Mingli Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TITA is a lightweight framework that reduces hallucinations in Vision-Language Models by providing token-level corrective signals during inference without retraining the base model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing alignment approaches for VLMs rely on expensive fine-tuning or provide only coarse feedback, limiting their effectiveness in reducing hallucinations.

Method: TITA freezes the base VLM and trains a reward model to approximate its distribution, then extracts implicit preference signals as log-probability ratios during inference to provide dense autoregressive feedback.

Result: Extensive evaluations show consistent gains across 12 benchmarks, with 8.6% improvement on MMVet and 6.7% on POPE, indicating stronger general understanding and reduced hallucinations across multiple model sizes.

Conclusion: TITA effectively reduces hallucinations in VLMs with negligible inference overhead, providing token-level alignment without retraining the backbone model.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become essential backbones of modern
multimodal intelligence, yet their outputs remain prone to
hallucination-plausible text misaligned with visual inputs. Existing alignment
approaches often rely on expensive fine-tuning with annotated preference data
or sequence-level inference strategies that provide only coarse, delayed
feedback. To overcome these limitations, we present TITA (Token-level
Inference-Time Alignment), a lightweight framework that freezes the base VLM
and instead trains a reward model to approximate its distribution. During
inference, implicit preference signals are extracted as log-probability ratios
between the reward model and the target VLM, yielding dense autoregressive
feedback. This formulation can be viewed as an inference-time variant of Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), providing token-level corrective signals without
retraining the backbone. Extensive evaluations on LLaVA-1.5-7B and 13B show
consistent gains across 12 benchmarks, with improvements of 8.6% on MMVet and
6.7% on POPE, indicating stronger general understanding and reduced
hallucinations. Additional experiments on Qwen2.5-VL-7B and DeepSeek-VL2-27.5B
show comparable gains, especially in hallucination reduction and VQA accuracy,
while incurring negligible inference overhead.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes HIBA (Hierarchical Interleaved Block Attention) architecture for time series foundation models, introducing the Xihe model family that achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across parameter scales from 9.5M to 1.5B.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series foundation models directly adopt cross-domain architectures from language models, which limits their ability to effectively capture multiscale temporal dependencies in time series data, especially during zero-shot transfer across datasets with different patterns and sampling strategies.

Method: Proposed Hierarchical Interleaved Block Attention (HIBA) with hierarchical inter- and intra-block sparse attention to capture multi-scale dependencies. Intra-block attention handles local information exchange, while inter-block attention captures global temporal pattern interaction and dynamic evolution.

Result: Xihe-tiny (9.5M parameters) surpasses most contemporary TSFMs, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency. Xihe-max (1.5B) establishes new state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on GIFT-Eval benchmark, significantly outperforming previous best results.

Conclusion: The consistent performance excellence across the entire parameter spectrum provides compelling evidence for the exceptional generalization capabilities and architectural superiority of the HIBA approach for time series foundation models.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of time series foundation models (TSFMs) has been
propelled by migrating architectures from language models. While existing TSFMs
demonstrate impressive performance, their direct adoption of cross-domain
architectures constrains effective capture of multiscale temporal dependencies
inherent to time series data. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced
during zero-shot transfer across datasets with divergent underlying patterns
and sampling strategies. To address these challenges, we propose Hierarchical
Interleaved Block Attention (HIBA) which employs hierarchical inter- and
intra-block sparse attention to effectively capture multi-scale dependencies.
Intra-block attention facilitates local information exchange, and inter-block
attention operates across blocks to capture global temporal pattern interaction
and dynamic evolution. Leveraging the HIBA architecture, we introduce Xihe, a
scalable TSFM family spanning from an ultra-efficient 9.5M parameter
configuration to high-capacity 1.5B variant. Evaluated on the comprehensive
GIFT-Eval benchmark, our most compact Xihe-tiny model (9.5M) surpasses the
majority of contemporary TSFMs, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency.
More impressively, Xihe-max (1.5B) establishes new state-of-the-art zero-shot
performance, surpassing previous best results by a substantial margin. This
consistent performance excellence across the entire parameter spectrum provides
compelling evidence for the exceptional generalization capabilities and
architectural superiority of HIBA.

integrating automatic capabilities to ease the task for annotators and assess
their performance. The research delves into the practical implications of the
annotation processes, the integration of AI components, and the evaluation of
its outcomes. We analyze their impact on efficiency, accuracy, and overall
annotation quality. Focusing on the Human-in-the-Loop for video annotation
tasks, we implemented a single-iteration scheme using Label Studio and
AI-powered zero-shot pre-annotations. Using this framework, we designed a test
based on the annotation of the UCF-Crime dataset to discriminate between normal
and abnormal activities in video footage. Our results evidence how automatic
AI-based pre-annotation can streamline the video annotation workflow,
empowering human annotators and optimizing the overall pipeline. Using the
pre-annotated data, we observed a 35% reduction in the annotation time for 70%
of the annotators with similar quality annotations, compared to the traditional
manual annotation task. Results are consistent with asset duration and
complexity. We also observed that while annotators rapidly learned to use the
tool, the produced annotations are more coherent among annotators and better
match the natural clustering of the video frames.

TL;DR: A novel multimodal framework combining anatomical structure graphs from SAM segmentations with radiographic features improves knee osteoarthritis classification accuracy by up to 10% over single-modality baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knee osteoarthritis diagnosis from radiographs is challenging because standard deep learning models struggle to capture subtle morphological details that are crucial for clinical assessment.

Method: Propose a multimodal framework that integrates morphological graph representations derived from Segment Anything Model (SAM) segmentations with a vision encoder, enforcing alignment between geometry-informed graph embeddings and radiographic features through mutual information maximization.

Result: Experiments on Osteoarthritis Initiative dataset show 10% accuracy improvement over single-modality baselines (reaching nearly 80% accuracy), and outperform state-of-the-art methods by 8% in accuracy and 11% in F1 score.

Conclusion: Incorporating anatomical structure into radiographic analysis is critical for accurate knee osteoarthritis severity grading, as demonstrated by the significant performance improvements achieved through the proposed multimodal approach.

Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) diagnosis from radiographs remains challenging due
to the subtle morphological details that standard deep learning models struggle
to capture effectively. We propose a novel multimodal framework that combines
anatomical structure with radiographic features by integrating a morphological
graph representation - derived from Segment Anything Model (SAM) segmentations
- with a vision encoder. Our approach enforces alignment between
geometry-informed graph embeddings and radiographic features through mutual
information maximization, significantly improving KOA classification accuracy.
By constructing graphs from anatomical features, we introduce explicit
morphological priors that mirror clinical assessment criteria, enriching the
feature space and enhancing the model's inductive bias. Experiments on the
Osteoarthritis Initiative dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses
single-modality baselines by up to 10\% in accuracy (reaching nearly 80\%),
while outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods by 8\% in accuracy and
11\% in F1 score. These results underscore the critical importance of
incorporating anatomical structure into radiographic analysis for accurate KOA
severity grading.

### [21] [It Takes Two to Tango: Two Parallel Samplers Improve Quality in Diffusion Models for Limited Steps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21802)
*Pedro Cisneros-Velarde*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using two parallel samplers with limited denoising steps improves diffusion model image quality through proper information integration, without requiring additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve sample quality from diffusion models when constrained by a limited number of denoising steps, since standard single-sampler approaches may be suboptimal under such constraints.

Method: Employ two parallel processors that perform denoising steps at successive times and appropriately integrate their information in the latent image representation.

Result: The method improves sample quality in both automated and human evaluations across different diffusion models, while naive integration approaches degrade quality and adding more samplers doesn't necessarily help.

Conclusion: A simple, plug-and-play dual-sampler approach effectively enhances diffusion model performance under step constraints, demonstrating that proper information integration from parallel processors is key.

Abstract: We consider the situation where we have a limited number of denoising steps,
i.e., of evaluations of a diffusion model. We show that two parallel processors
or samplers under such limitation can improve the quality of the sampled image.
Particularly, the two samplers make denoising steps at successive times, and
their information is appropriately integrated in the latent image. Remarkably,
our method is simple both conceptually and to implement: it is plug-&-play,
model agnostic, and does not require any additional fine-tuning or external
models. We test our method with both automated and human evaluations for
different diffusion models. We also show that a naive integration of the
information from the two samplers lowers sample quality. Finally, we find that
adding more parallel samplers does not necessarily improve sample quality.

*Jiaao Yu,Mingjie Han,Tao Gong,Jian Zhang,Man Lan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FDA-CLIP is a CLIP-based framework that uses frame differences to create dynamic region masks, guiding the model to focus on critical dynamic video regions while suppressing static background redundancy for improved text-video retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in text-video retrieval: high data annotation costs and modal gap between video-text features. Existing CLIP adaptation methods lack dynamic feature enhancement and fail to suppress static redundant features.

Method: Proposes FDA-CLIP framework that generates dynamic region masks using frame differences, then inputs these masks as Alpha channels into Alpha-CLIP to guide attention toward semantically important dynamic regions.

Result: Experiments show that frame difference-guided video semantic encoding effectively balances retrieval efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: FDA-CLIP successfully enhances dynamic video feature representation and suppresses static redundancy, improving text-video alignment performance.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of video data, text-video retrieval technology has
become increasingly important in numerous application scenarios such as
recommendation and search. Early text-video retrieval methods suffer from two
critical drawbacks: first, they heavily rely on large-scale annotated
video-text pairs, leading to high data acquisition costs; second, there is a
significant modal gap between video and text features, which limits cross-modal
alignment accuracy. With the development of vision-language model, adapting
CLIP to video tasks has attracted great attention. However, existing adaptation
methods generally lack enhancement for dynamic video features and fail to
effectively suppress static redundant features. To address this issue, this
paper proposes FDA-CLIP (Frame Difference Alpha-CLIP), which is a concise
CLIP-based training framework for text-video alignment. Specifically, the
method uses frame differences to generate dynamic region masks, which are input
into Alpha-CLIP as an additional Alpha channel. This proactively guides the
model to focus on semantically critical dynamic regions while suppressing
static background redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that frame
difference-guided video semantic encoding can effectively balance retrieval
efficiency and accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel fine-tuning task called Masked Prediction via Context and Commonsense (MPCC) to enhance multimodal reasoning in vision-language models by forcing integration of visual context and commonsense reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning models have limited adaptation to real-world multimodal scenarios due to heavy focus on single-modal language settings, failing to fully exploit visual context and commonsense knowledge.

Method: Proposed MPCC task that reconstructs semantically meaningful content from occluded images, developed MPCC Eval benchmark, and introduced Reinforcement Fine-tuning with Prior Sampling training method.

Result: The approach enhances model performance and improves generalized reasoning capabilities in out-of-distribution (OOD) and cross-task scenarios.

Conclusion: The MPCC framework successfully bridges the gap in multimodal reasoning by integrating visual context and commonsense knowledge, enabling better generalization across diverse multimodal environments.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in reasoning models have markedly advanced the reasoning
capabilities of large language models, particularly via training on tasks with
verifiable rewards. Yet, a significant gap persists in their adaptation to real
world multimodal scenarios, most notably, vision language tasks, due to a heavy
focus on single modal language settings. While efforts to transplant
reinforcement learning techniques from NLP to VLMs have emerged, these
approaches often remain confined to perception centric tasks or reduce images
to textual summaries, failing to fully exploit visual context and commonsense
knowledge, ultimately constraining the generalization of reasoning capabilities
across diverse multimodal environments. To address this limitation, we
introduce a novel fine tuning task, Masked Prediction via Context and
Commonsense, which forces models to integrate visual context and commonsense
reasoning by reconstructing semantically meaningful content from occluded
images, thereby laying the foundation for generalized reasoning. To
systematically evaluate the model performance in generalized reasoning, we
developed a specialized evaluation benchmark, MPCC Eval, and employed various
fine tuning strategies to guide reasoning. Among these, we introduced an
innovative training method, Reinforcement Fine tuning with Prior Sampling,
which not only enhances model performance but also improves its generalized
reasoning capabilities in OOD and cross task scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SRE-CLIP is a novel framework that enhances CLIP for Domain-Adaptive Zero-Shot Learning by addressing inefficient cross-category knowledge transfer and degraded cross-modal alignment through semantic relation guidance and alignment preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High data annotation costs drive the need for data-efficient learning, but existing methods fail to balance cross-domain transfer and cross-category generalization in Domain-Adaptive Zero-Shot Learning (DAZSL). Current CLIP-based approaches don't fully leverage vision-language models' potential for this task.

Method: Proposes Semantic Relation-Enhanced CLIP (SRE-CLIP) Adapter with Semantic Relation Structure Loss for better cross-category knowledge transfer and Cross-Modal Alignment Retention Strategy to maintain alignment during target domain fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on I2AwA and I2WebV benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing DAZSL methods as the first CLIP-based approach in this domain.

Conclusion: SRE-CLIP successfully addresses key challenges in DAZSL by enhancing CLIP's capabilities through semantic relation guidance and cross-modal alignment preservation, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: The high cost of data annotation has spurred research on training deep
learning models in data-limited scenarios. Existing paradigms, however, fail to
balance cross-domain transfer and cross-category generalization, giving rise to
the demand for Domain-Adaptive Zero-Shot Learning (DAZSL). Although
vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have inherent advantages in the DAZSL
field, current studies do not fully exploit their potential. Applying CLIP to
DAZSL faces two core challenges: inefficient cross-category knowledge transfer
due to the lack of semantic relation guidance, and degraded cross-modal
alignment during target domain fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose
a Semantic Relation-Enhanced CLIP (SRE-CLIP) Adapter framework, integrating a
Semantic Relation Structure Loss and a Cross-Modal Alignment Retention
Strategy. As the first CLIP-based DAZSL method, SRE-CLIP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the I2AwA and I2WebV benchmarks, significantly
outperforming existing approaches.

TL;DR: Proposes incorporating action description as an auxiliary task in reinforcement learning for robot navigation, using knowledge distillation from pre-trained vision-language models to enable explainable AI without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between explainability and performance in robot navigation systems, where explainable systems typically underperform non-explainable ones, and overcome the challenge of lacking ground-truth data for action description in reinforcement learning.

Method: Uses knowledge distillation from pre-trained vision-language models to incorporate action description as an auxiliary task in reinforcement learning for navigation, eliminating the need for ground-truth description data.

Result: Achieves high navigation performance while providing action descriptions, and attains state-of-the-art performance in semantic audio-visual navigation tasks.

Conclusion: The approach successfully enables explainable robot navigation systems that maintain high performance by leveraging knowledge distillation from pre-trained models, bridging the gap between explainability and performance in multimodal navigation.

Abstract: The field of multimodal robot navigation in indoor environments has garnered
significant attention in recent years. However, as tasks and methods become
more advanced, the action decision systems tend to become more complex and
operate as black-boxes. For a reliable system, the ability to explain or
describe its decisions is crucial; however, there tends to be a trade-off in
that explainable systems can not outperform non-explainable systems in terms of
performance. In this paper, we propose incorporating the task of describing
actions in language into the reinforcement learning of navigation as an
auxiliary task. Existing studies have found it difficult to incorporate
describing actions into reinforcement learning due to the absence of
ground-truth data. We address this issue by leveraging knowledge distillation
from pre-trained description generation models, such as vision-language models.
We comprehensively evaluate our approach across various navigation tasks,
demonstrating that it can describe actions while attaining high navigation
performance. Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art performance in the
particularly challenging multimodal navigation task of semantic audio-visual
navigation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid AI framework combining traditional feature extraction with deep learning for enhanced diabetic retinopathy detection, improving early diagnosis accuracy and reducing false negatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diabetic Retinopathy is a major vision-threatening complication affecting India's large diabetic population, requiring early screening since it's asymptomatic initially. Current methods need improvement for better detection accuracy.

Method: Hybrid diagnostic framework that synergizes traditional handcrafted feature extraction (capturing clinical markers) with deep learning (automating hierarchical pattern recognition) for multimodal analysis of fundus images.

Result: The hybrid model surpasses standalone deep learning approaches, demonstrating superior classification performance and significant reduction in false negatives for DR detection.

Conclusion: This multimodal AI-driven approach enables scalable and accurate DR screening, which is crucial for diabetes-burdened regions like India, providing a more effective solution for early detection and prevention of vision loss.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a vision-threatening complication of Dia-betes
Mellitus (DM), is a major global concern, particularly in India, which has one
of the highest diabetic populations. Prolonged hyperglycemia damages reti-nal
microvasculature, leading to DR symptoms like microaneurysms, hemor-rhages, and
fluid leakage, which, if undetected, cause irreversible vision loss. Therefore,
early screening is crucial as DR is asymptomatic in its initial stages. Fundus
imaging aids precise diagnosis by detecting subtle retinal lesions. This paper
introduces a hybrid diagnostic framework combining traditional feature
extraction and deep learning (DL) to enhance DR detection. While handcrafted
features capture key clinical markers, DL automates hierarchical pattern
recog-nition, improving early diagnosis. The model synergizes interpretable
clinical data with learned features, surpassing standalone DL approaches that
demon-strate superior classification and reduce false negatives. This
multimodal AI-driven approach enables scalable, accurate DR screening, crucial
for diabetes-burdened regions.

TL;DR: SITS-DECO is a decoder-only generative model for Earth Observation data that uses unified token sequences to perform multiple tasks without task-specific adaptation, outperforming larger models on crop classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current EO foundation models require adaptation for specific tasks and are rigidly structured around particular data sources. The authors aim to create a more flexible, unified approach inspired by large language models.

Method: Uses a simple GPT-style decoder-only architecture with symbolic prompting to perform pixel-wise, multi-temporal, multi-modal crop-type classification in a purely generative framework without task-specific adaptation.

Result: Despite its simplicity and lack of spatial context, SITS-DECO outperforms much larger EO foundation models on crop-type classification (PASTIS-R), demonstrating that dense temporal sequence modeling is critical.

Conclusion: The work shows that capability arises from data diversity and structure rather than architectural complexity, providing a lightweight route to multi-modal, multi-task EO modeling and bridging toward future generative EO foundation models.

Abstract: Earth Observation (EO) Foundation Modelling (FM) holds great promise for
simplifying and improving the use of EO data for diverse real-world tasks.
However, most existing models require additional adaptation before they can be
used and are structured rigidly around particular data sources or training
approaches. To address this, we take inspiration from large language models,
where diverse tasks, both pre-training and downstream, are implicitly captured
through next-token prediction over unified token sequences, leveraging the
structure and diversity of the training data.
  We introduce SITS-DECO (Satellite Image Time Series-DECoder Only), a
proof-of-concept generative model that applies this unified-sequence framing to
EO data. Using a simple GPT-style decoder-only architecture, and demonstrate
its ability to perform useful EO tasks (pixel-wise, multi-temporal, multi-modal
crop-type classification) in a purely generative framework. Through symbolic
prompting, we show that the model can perform multiple supervised and
self-supervised tasks within a single unified architecture, without task- or
modality-specific adaptation. Despite its simplicity and lack of spatial
context, SITS-DECO outperforms much larger EO foundation models on crop-type
classification (PASTIS-R) demonstrating that dense temporal sequence modelling
is a critical missing ingredient in the current paradigm.
  This work exemplifies a data-centric modelling paradigm in which capability
arises from the diversity and structure of the training data rather than from
architectural complexity. SITS-DECO provides a lightweight, practical route to
multi-modal, multi-task EO modelling, and a conceptual bridge toward future
generative EO foundation models.

### [29] [Gestura: A LVLM-Powered System Bridging Motion and Semantics for Real-Time Free-Form Gesture Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21814)
*Zhuoming Li,Aitong Liu,Mengxi Jia,Tengxiang Zhang,Dell Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gestura is an end-to-end system that improves free-form gesture understanding using a Large Vision-Language Model with anatomical hand priors and Chain-of-Thought reasoning, achieving better accuracy and response times than existing solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing solutions like GestureGPT have limited recognition accuracy and slow response times for free-form gesture understanding, which is important for liberating users from predefined gesture categories in human-computer interaction.

Method: Uses pre-trained LVLM aligned with gesture semantics, adds Landmark Processing Module with anatomical hand priors to capture subtle movements, and employs Chain-of-Thought reasoning for step-by-step semantic inference to handle ambiguous gestures.

Result: Gestura achieves robust and adaptable free-form gesture comprehension, and the authors created the first open-source dataset for free-form gesture intention reasoning with over 300,000 annotated QA pairs.

Conclusion: The combination of LVLM with anatomical hand priors and CoT reasoning enables effective free-form gesture understanding, overcoming limitations of previous approaches and providing a foundation for future research with the new dataset.

Abstract: Free-form gesture understanding is highly appealing for human-computer
interaction, as it liberates users from the constraints of predefined gesture
categories. However, the sole existing solution GestureGPT suffers from limited
recognition accuracy and slow response times. In this paper, we propose
Gestura, an end-to-end system for free-form gesture understanding. Gestura
harnesses a pre-trained Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to align the highly
dynamic and diverse patterns of free-form gestures with high-level semantic
concepts. To better capture subtle hand movements across different styles, we
introduce a Landmark Processing Module that compensate for LVLMs' lack of
fine-grained domain knowledge by embedding anatomical hand priors. Further, a
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning strategy enables step-by-step semantic
inference, transforming shallow knowledge into deep semantic understanding and
significantly enhancing the model's ability to interpret ambiguous or
unconventional gestures. Together, these components allow Gestura to achieve
robust and adaptable free-form gesture comprehension. Additionally, we have
developed the first open-source dataset for free-form gesture intention
reasoning and understanding with over 300,000 annotated QA pairs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether attributes explicitly specified in AI-generated prompts are correctly rendered in the resulting images, with implications for bias detection and model evaluation.

Method: Used two public-domain datasets with 430 total visualizations (200 of women in cultural/creative industries, 230 of museum curators) and assessed accuracy across personal attributes, appearance, and paraphernalia.

Result: DALL-E3 deviated from prompt specifications in 15.6% of all attributes. Errors were lowest for paraphernalia, moderate for personal appearance, and highest for depictions of age.

Conclusion: There are measurable prompt-to-image fidelity gaps in AI image generation models, with implications for bias detection and model evaluation practices.

Abstract: This study examines the prompt fidelity of ChatGPT4o / DALL-E3 text-to-image
visualisations by analysing whether attributes explicitly specified in
autogenously generated prompts are correctly rendered in the resulting images.
Using two public-domain datasets comprising 200 visualisations of women working
in the cultural and creative industries and 230 visualisations of museum
curators, the study assessed accuracy across personal attributes (age, hair),
appearance (attire, glasses), and paraphernalia (name tags, clipboards). While
correctly rendered in most cases, DALL-E3 deviated from prompt specifications
in 15.6% of all attributes (n=710). Errors were lowest for paraphernalia,
moderate for personal appearance, and highest for depictions of the person
themselves, particularly age. These findings demonstrate measurable
prompt-to-image fidelity gaps with implications for bias detection and model
evaluation.

*Sai Teja Erukude,Suhasnadh Reddy Veluru,Viswa Chaitanya Marella*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A wavelet-based method using DWT preprocessing and ResNet50 classification achieves high accuracy (95.1%) in detecting StyleGAN-generated images by leveraging unique wavelet-domain artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying GAN-generated images has become a significant challenge in digital image forensics, requiring effective detection methods.

Method: Uses discrete wavelet transform (DWT) with Haar and Daubechies filters to create multi-resolution representations, then feeds them to ResNet50 for classification, comparing against spatial domain models.

Result: Haar and Daubechies models achieved 93.8% and 95.1% accuracy respectively, significantly outperforming spatial domain model (81.5% accuracy), with Daubechies performing best.

Conclusion: GAN-generated images have unique wavelet-domain artifacts, and wavelet-domain analysis is highly effective for GAN image detection, showing potential for improving deepfake detection systems.

Abstract: Identifying images generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has
become a significant challenge in digital image forensics. This research
presents a wavelet-based detection method that uses discrete wavelet transform
(DWT) preprocessing and a ResNet50 classification layer to differentiate the
StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Haar and Daubechies wavelet filters
are applied to convert the input images into multi-resolution representations,
which will then be fed to a ResNet50 network for classification, capitalizing
on subtle artifacts left by the generative process. Moreover, the wavelet-based
models are compared to an identical ResNet50 model trained on spatial data. The
Haar and Daubechies preprocessed models achieved a greater accuracy of 93.8
percent and 95.1 percent, much higher than the model developed in the spatial
domain (accuracy rate of 81.5 percent). The Daubechies-based model outperforms
Haar, showing that adding layers of descriptive frequency patterns can lead to
even greater distinguishing power. These results indicate that the
GAN-generated images have unique wavelet-domain artifacts or "fingerprints."
The method proposed illustrates the effectiveness of wavelet-domain analysis to
detect GAN images and emphasizes the potential of further developing the
capabilities of future deepfake detection systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents an explainable deep learning framework using ResNet50 and DenseNet121 for detecting brain tumors in MRI and pneumonia in chest X-rays, achieving high accuracy with DenseNet121 performing better, and uses Grad-CAM for model interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of interpretability in deep learning models for medical imaging, which hampers clinical trust and adoption, by developing an explainable AI framework.

Method: Used ResNet50 and DenseNet121 CNNs trained on Kaggle datasets (7,023 brain MRI and 5,863 chest X-ray images) and integrated Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) for heatmap visualizations to explain model decisions.

Result: DenseNet121 outperformed ResNet50 with 94.3% vs 92.5% accuracy for brain tumors and 89.1% vs 84.4% for pneumonia. Grad-CAM showed DenseNet121 focused on core pathological regions while ResNet50 sometimes scattered attention to non-pathological areas.

Conclusion: Combining deep learning with explainable AI offers a promising path toward reliable, interpretable, and clinically useful diagnostic tools in medical imaging.

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) holds enormous potential for improving medical imaging
diagnostics, yet the lack of interpretability in most models hampers clinical
trust and adoption. This paper presents an explainable deep learning framework
for detecting brain tumors in MRI scans and pneumonia in chest X-ray images
using two leading Convolutional Neural Networks, ResNet50 and DenseNet121.
These models were trained on publicly available Kaggle datasets comprising
7,023 brain MRI images and 5,863 chest X-ray images, achieving high
classification performance. DenseNet121 consistently outperformed ResNet50 with
94.3 percent vs. 92.5 percent accuracy for brain tumors and 89.1 percent vs.
84.4 percent accuracy for pneumonia. For better explainability,
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was integrated to create
heatmap visualizations superimposed on the test images, indicating the most
influential image regions in the decision-making process. Interestingly, while
both models produced accurate results, Grad-CAM showed that DenseNet121
consistently focused on core pathological regions, whereas ResNet50 sometimes
scattered attention to peripheral or non-pathological areas. Combining deep
learning and explainable AI offers a promising path toward reliable,
interpretable, and clinically useful diagnostic tools.

*Mojtaba Moattari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes reliability thresholding metrics and engineered features to improve chromosome classification precision in low-quality image settings, achieving over 90% accuracy for chromosomes with common defects and translocations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current karyotyping systems require large amounts of high-quality training data, which is not available in some pathological laboratories with limited resources and low-cost systems. The goal is to prevent false positive detections in such settings.

Method: The method uses reliability thresholding metrics and deliberately engineered features, evaluated with variations of deep Alex-Net neural network, SVM, K Nearest-Neighbors, and their cascade pipelines for automated filtering of semi-straight chromosomes.

Result: Classification results improved significantly, achieving over 90% accuracy for chromosomes with common defects and translocations. A comparative analysis identified the best thresholding metric with its salient characteristics.

Conclusion: The high precision results on a very low-quality G-banding database demonstrate the suitability of the proposed metrics and pruning method for karyotyping facilities in poor countries and low-budget pathological laboratories.

Abstract: In the last decade, due to high resolution cameras and accurate meta-phase
analyzes, the accuracy of chromosome classification has improved substantially.
However, current Karyotyping systems demand large number of high quality train
data to have an adequately plausible Precision per each chromosome. Such
provision of high quality train data with accurate devices are not yet
accomplished in some out-reached pathological laboratories. To prevent false
positive detections in low-cost systems and low-quality images settings, this
paper improves the classification Precision of chromosomes using proposed
reliability thresholding metrics and deliberately engineered features. The
proposed method has been evaluated using a variation of deep Alex-Net neural
network, SVM, K Nearest-Neighbors, and their cascade pipelines to an automated
filtering of semi-straight chromosome. The classification results have highly
improved over 90% for the chromosomes with more common defections and
translocations. Furthermore, a comparative analysis over the proposed
thresholding metrics has been conducted and the best metric is bolded with its
salient characteristics. The high Precision results provided for a very
low-quality G-banding database verifies suitability of the proposed metrics and
pruning method for Karyotyping facilities in poor countries and lowbudget
pathological laboratories.

*Yichi Zhang,Zhuo Chen,Lingbing Guo,Lei Liang,Wen Zhang,Huajun Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces STAR-64K, a 64K multi-modal instruction dataset for Structured and Abstractive Reasoning (STAR) with Multi-Modal Relational Knowledge, and a two-stage training framework that enables smaller 3B/7B models to outperform GPT-4o on STAR tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal large language models struggle with understanding and reasoning about abstractive visual information, particularly Multi-Modal Relational Knowledge (MMRK) representing relational structures between multi-modal entities, which remains largely unexplored.

Method: Developed an automatic STAR data engine to synthesize images with MMRK and build multi-modal instruction data with chain-of-thought reasoning, plus a comprehensive two-stage capability enhancement training framework with tailored evaluation protocols.

Result: Experimental results across 5 open-source MLLMs show that the two-stage enhancement framework enables smaller 3B/7B models to significantly outperform GPT-4o in STAR tasks, with additional analysis on design effectiveness, data transferability, and scalability.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully bridges gaps in data and methodology for structured abstractive reasoning, demonstrating that properly designed training frameworks can enable smaller models to achieve superior performance on complex multi-modal reasoning tasks compared to larger foundation models.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning with abstractive information from the visual
modality presents significant challenges for current multi-modal large language
models (MLLMs). Among the various forms of abstractive information, Multi-Modal
Relational Knowledge (MMRK), which represents abstract relational structures
between multi-modal entities using node-edge formats, remains largely
under-explored. In particular, STructured and Abstractive Reasoning (STAR) on
such data has received little attention from the research community. To bridge
the dual gaps in large-scale high-quality data and capability enhancement
methodologies, this paper makes the following key contributions: (i). An
automatic STAR data engine capable of synthesizing images with MMRK to build
multi-modal instruction data with reliable chain-of-thought thinking for
various STAR tasks and (ii). A comprehsive two-stage capability enhancement
training framework, accompanied by a suite of evaluation protocols tailored to
different STAR tasks. Based upon these contributions, we introduce STAR-64K, a
dataset comprising 64K high-quality multi-modal instruction samples, and
conduct experiments across 5 open-source MLLMs. Experimental results show that
our two-stage enhancement framework enables smaller 3B/7B models to
significantly outperform GPT-4o in STAR. Additionally, we provide in-depth
analysis regarding the effectiveness of various designs, data transferability,
and scalability.

### [35] [A Flow Model with Low-Rank Transformers for Incomplete Multimodal Survival Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21829)
*Yi Yin,Yuntao Shou,Zao Dai,Yun Peng,Tao Meng,Wei Ai,Keqin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework combining low-rank Transformer with flow-based generative model for robust multimodal survival prediction that handles incomplete medical data modalities through cross-modal distribution alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world multimodal medical datasets often have incomplete modalities due to acquisition limitations, and existing methods ignore distributional discrepancies across modalities, leading to unreliable reconstruction.

Method: Uses class-specific flow for cross-modal distribution alignment with normalizing flow models to create distribution-consistent latent spaces, combined with a lightweight low-rank Transformer to model intra-modal dependencies and prevent overfitting.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance under complete modality settings and maintains robust accuracy under incomplete modality scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses incomplete multimodal survival analysis by ensuring distribution consistency in reconstructed modalities and provides superior performance across both complete and incomplete data scenarios.

Abstract: In recent years, multimodal medical data-based survival analysis has
attracted much attention. However, real-world datasets often suffer from the
problem of incomplete modality, where some patient modality information is
missing due to acquisition limitations or system failures. Existing methods
typically infer missing modalities directly from observed ones using deep
neural networks, but they often ignore the distributional discrepancy across
modalities, resulting in inconsistent and unreliable modality reconstruction.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that combines a
low-rank Transformer with a flow-based generative model for robust and flexible
multimodal survival prediction. Specifically, we first formulate the concerned
problem as incomplete multimodal survival analysis using the multi-instance
representation of whole slide images (WSIs) and genomic profiles. To realize
incomplete multimodal survival analysis, we propose a class-specific flow for
cross-modal distribution alignment. Under the condition of class labels, we
model and transform the cross-modal distribution. By virtue of the reversible
structure and accurate density modeling capabilities of the normalizing flow
model, the model can effectively construct a distribution-consistent latent
space of the missing modality, thereby improving the consistency between the
reconstructed data and the true distribution. Finally, we design a lightweight
Transformer architecture to model intra-modal dependencies while alleviating
the overfitting problem in high-dimensional modality fusion by virtue of the
low-rank Transformer. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method
not only achieves state-of-the-art performance under complete modality
settings, but also maintains robust and superior accuracy under the incomplete
modalities scenario.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated image-based garbage classification is critical for global waste management, but systematic benchmarks integrating ML, DL, and hybrid solutions remain underdeveloped.

Method: Comprehensive comparison of three paradigms: (1) ML with handcrafted features, (2) DL architectures (ResNet variants, EfficientNetV2S), and (3) hybrid approach using deep models for feature extraction combined with classical classifiers (SVM, Logistic Regression).

Result: Hybrid method consistently outperforms others, achieving up to 100% accuracy on TrashNet and refined Household dataset, and 99.87% on Garbage Classification dataset, surpassing state-of-the-art benchmarks. Feature selection reduces dimensionality by over 95% without accuracy loss.

Conclusion: This work establishes reliable benchmarks for waste classification and introduces an efficient hybrid framework that achieves high accuracy while reducing inference cost, making it suitable for scalable deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Automated image-based garbage classification is a critical component of
global waste management; however, systematic benchmarks that integrate Machine
Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and efficient hybrid solutions remain
underdeveloped. This study provides a comprehensive comparison of three
paradigms: (1) machine learning algorithms using handcrafted features, (2) deep
learning architectures, including ResNet variants and EfficientNetV2S, and (3)
a hybrid approach that utilizes deep models for feature extraction combined
with classical classifiers such as Support Vector Machine and Logistic
Regression to identify the most effective strategy. Experiments on three public
datasets - TrashNet, Garbage Classification, and a refined Household Garbage
Dataset (with 43 corrected mislabels)- demonstrate that the hybrid method
consistently outperforms the others, achieving up to 100% accuracy on TrashNet
and the refined Household set, and 99.87% on Garbage Classification, thereby
surpassing state-of-the-art benchmarks. Furthermore, feature selection reduces
feature dimensionality by over 95% without compromising accuracy, resulting in
faster training and inference. This work establishes more reliable benchmarks
for waste classification and introduces an efficient hybrid framework that
achieves high accuracy while reducing inference cost, making it suitable for

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPT-4o achieves 74% accuracy in zero-shot chest X-ray classification (normal vs pneumonia) using feature-focused prompts, but reasoning-based prompts perform worse, showing limited diagnostic reliability for clinical use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate GPT-4o's zero-shot capability for medical image interpretation without fine-tuning, specifically for chest X-ray classification between normal and pneumonia cases.

Method: Used balanced test set of 400 images (200 normal, 200 pneumonia) with four different prompt designs ranging from minimal instructions to detailed reasoning-based prompts in a zero-shot setting.

Result: Concise, feature-focused prompts achieved highest accuracy of 74%, while reasoning-oriented prompts resulted in lower performance. Model shows emerging potential but limited diagnostic reliability.

Conclusion: While ChatGPT demonstrates emerging capabilities for medical image interpretation, significant advances in visual reasoning and domain-specific adaptation are needed before safe clinical application.

Abstract: In this study, we evaluate the ability of OpenAI's gpt-4o model to classify
chest X-ray images as either NORMAL or PNEUMONIA in a zero-shot setting,
without any prior fine-tuning. A balanced test set of 400 images (200 from each
class) was used to assess performance across four distinct prompt designs,
ranging from minimal instructions to detailed, reasoning-based prompts. The
results indicate that concise, feature-focused prompts achieved the highest
classification accuracy of 74\%, whereas reasoning-oriented prompts resulted in
lower performance. These findings highlight that while ChatGPT exhibits
emerging potential for medical image interpretation, its diagnostic reliability
remains limited. Continued advances in visual reasoning and domain-specific
adaptation are required before such models can be safely applied in clinical
practice.

Motivation: Current video generative models lack physical understanding despite visual realism, and SSL pretraining on natural videos has shown emergent intuitive physics understanding.

Method: Built on MAGI-1 video generative model and coupled it with VJEPA-2 (Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture 2) to guide generation process using VJEPA-2 as reward signal.

Result: Improved physics plausibility of state-of-the-art video generative models by approximately 6%.

Conclusion: SSL-based video world models can effectively improve physics plausibility in video generation when used as guidance signals.

Abstract: This is a short technical report describing the winning entry of the
PhysicsIQ Challenge, presented at the Perception Test Workshop at ICCV 2025.
State-of-the-art video generative models exhibit severely limited physical
understanding, and often produce implausible videos. The Physics IQ benchmark
has shown that visual realism does not imply physics understanding. Yet,
intuitive physics understanding has shown to emerge from SSL pretraining on
natural videos. In this report, we investigate whether we can leverage
SSL-based video world models to improve the physics plausibility of video
generative models. In particular, we build ontop of the state-of-the-art video
generative model MAGI-1 and couple it with the recently introduced Video Joint
Embedding Predictive Architecture 2 (VJEPA-2) to guide the generation process.
We show that by leveraging VJEPA-2 as reward signal, we can improve the physics
plausibility of state-of-the-art video generative models by ~6%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RatioWaveNet enhances EEG-based motor imagery BCIs by adding a trainable wavelet front end to a CNN-Transformer backbone, improving robustness for challenging subjects while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable decoding from non-invasive EEG remains challenging due to nonstationarity, low SNR, and subject variability, particularly for the hardest subjects where BCIs typically fail.

Method: Augments TCFormer (temporal CNN-Transformer backbone) with Rationally-Dilated Wavelet Transform front end that performs undecimated multi-resolution subband decomposition, followed by grouped 1-D convolutions, multi-kernel CNN, grouped-query attention encoder, and compact TCN head.

Result: On BCI-IV-2a and BCI-IV-2b datasets, improves worst-subject accuracy by +0.17/+0.42 pp (2a) and +1.07/+2.54 pp (2b) across intra- and inter-subject protocols, with consistent average gains and modest computational overhead.

Conclusion: A simple, trainable wavelet front end effectively strengthens Transformer-based BCIs, improving worst-case reliability without sacrificing efficiency.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on motor imagery (MI) translate covert
movement intentions into actionable commands, yet reliable decoding from
non-invasive EEG remains challenging due to nonstationarity, low SNR, and
subject variability. We present RatioWaveNet, which augments a strong temporal
CNN-Transformer backbone (TCFormer) with a trainable, Rationally-Dilated
Wavelet Transform (RDWT) front end. The RDWT performs an undecimated,
multi-resolution subband decomposition that preserves temporal length and
shift-invariance, enhancing sensorimotor rhythms while mitigating jitter and
mild artifacts; subbands are fused via lightweight grouped 1-D convolutions and
passed to a multi-kernel CNN for local temporal-spatial feature extraction, a
grouped-query attention encoder for long-range context, and a compact TCN head
for causal temporal integration.
  Our goal is to test whether this principled wavelet front end improves
robustness precisely where BCIs typically fail - on the hardest subjects - and
whether such gains persist on average across seeds under both intra- and
inter-subject protocols. On BCI-IV-2a and BCI-IV-2b, across five seeds,
RatioWaveNet improves worst-subject accuracy over the Transformer backbone by
+0.17 / +0.42 percentage points (Sub-Dependent / LOSO) on 2a and by +1.07 /
+2.54 percentage points on 2b, with consistent average-case gains and modest
computational overhead. These results indicate that a simple, trainable wavelet
front end is an effective plug-in to strengthen Transformer-based BCIs,
improving worst-case reliability without sacrificing efficiency.

*Michael Aerni,Joshua Swanson,Kristina Nikolić,Florian Tramèr*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Modal aphasia is a systematic dissociation where multimodal models can memorize concepts visually but fail to articulate them in text, creating safety vulnerabilities when safeguards only apply to one modality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and understand a fundamental property of current unified multimodal models where they exhibit systematic failures in cross-modal concept articulation despite simultaneous training on images and text.

Method: Conducted controlled experiments on synthetic datasets using multiple architectures, testing leading frontier models' ability to reproduce iconic movie artwork visually versus describing them textually.

Result: Models generated near-perfect visual reproductions of iconic movie artwork but confused crucial details in textual descriptions, confirming modal aphasia as a fundamental property rather than training artifact.

Conclusion: Modal aphasia introduces AI safety vulnerabilities as safeguards applied to one modality may leave harmful concepts accessible in other modalities, demonstrated by models aligned solely on text remaining capable of generating unsafe images.

Abstract: We present modal aphasia, a systematic dissociation in which current unified
multimodal models accurately memorize concepts visually but fail to articulate
them in writing, despite being trained on images and text simultaneously. For
one, we show that leading frontier models can generate near-perfect
reproductions of iconic movie artwork, but confuse crucial details when asked
for textual descriptions. We corroborate those findings through controlled
experiments on synthetic datasets in multiple architectures. Our experiments
confirm that modal aphasia reliably emerges as a fundamental property of
current unified multimodal models, not just as a training artifact. In
practice, modal aphasia can introduce vulnerabilities in AI safety frameworks,
as safeguards applied to one modality may leave harmful concepts accessible in
other modalities. We demonstrate this risk by showing how a model aligned
solely on text remains capable of generating unsafe images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCoPE VLM is a vision-language model that uses Chain of Scroll mechanism for efficient long-context document navigation, reducing memory usage while modeling human-like reading behaviors for GUI control and web navigation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs neglect decision-oriented document understanding and are memory-intensive for long-context visual information processing, making them impractical for locally deployable solutions in agentic tasks like GUI control and web navigation.

Method: Proposes Chain of Scroll mechanism for selective and recursive document navigation, dedicated data generation pipeline for Chain of Scroll trajectories, and Episodic Group Relative Policy Optimization reinforcement learning method to bridge training-inference gap.

Result: Substantially reduces memory usage and effectively models human-like reading behaviors, making it the first framework to explicitly model agentic reading patterns in multi-page document question answering.

Conclusion: SCoPE VLM advances multimodal agent capabilities by providing an efficient, locally deployable solution for long-context visual document navigation through selective attention mechanisms and optimized training approaches.

Abstract: Understanding long-context visual information remains a fundamental challenge
for vision-language models, particularly in agentic tasks such as GUI control
and web navigation. While web pages and GUI environments are inherently
structured documents, current VLMs typically neglect decision-oriented document
understanding in their training objectives. Existing approaches primarily
extend visual embeddings to process long, high-resolution inputs, but these
methods are memory-intensive and impractical for locally deployable solutions.
To address these issues, we propose SCoPE VLM, a document navigation expert
that leverages a novel Chain of Scroll mechanism to selectively and recursively
navigate documents, focusing exclusively on relevant segments. We introduce a
dedicated data generation pipeline to construct informative Chain of Scroll
trajectories and Episodic Group Relative Policy Optimization, a tailored
reinforcement learning method to reduce the gap between training and inference.
Our method substantially reduces memory usage and effectively models human-like
reading behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, SCoPE VLM is the first
framework to explicitly model agentic reading patterns in multi-page document
question answering, advancing the capabilities of multimodal agents.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PFCT enables training Poisson Flow Consistency Models from scratch without distillation, improving CT image denoising performance with competitive LPIPS and SSIM scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PFCM was limited to distillation training, restricting its potential across data modalities. PFCT aims to enable standalone training of PFCM without requiring pretrained PFGM++.

Method: Leveraged perturbation kernel to remove dependency on pretrained PFGM++, introduced sinusoidal discretization schedule and Beta noise distribution for better adaptability and sample quality.

Result: Improved low dose CT image denoising in terms of LPIPS and SSIM metrics, achieved similar denoising effectiveness as Consistency Model.

Conclusion: PFCT is a valid standalone training method for PFCM with competitive generative modeling results, though further optimization and broader applicability studies are needed.

Abstract: The Poisson Flow Consistency Model (PFCM) is a consistency-style model based
on the robust Poisson Flow Generative Model++ (PFGM++) which has achieved
success in unconditional image generation and CT image denoising. Yet the PFCM
can only be trained in distillation which limits the potential of the PFCM in
many data modalities. The objective of this research was to create a method to
train the PFCM in isolation called Poisson Flow Consistency Training (PFCT).
The perturbation kernel was leveraged to remove the pretrained PFGM++, and the
sinusoidal discretization schedule and Beta noise distribution were introduced
in order to facilitate adaptability and improve sample quality. The model was
applied to the task of low dose computed tomography image denoising and
improved the low dose image in terms of LPIPS and SSIM. It also displayed
similar denoising effectiveness as models like the Consistency Model. PFCT is
established as a valid method of training the PFCM from its effectiveness in
denoising CT images, showing potential with competitive results to other
generative models. Further study is needed in the precise optimization of PFCT
and in its applicability to other generative modeling tasks. The framework of
PFCT creates more flexibility for the ways in which a PFCM can be created and
can be applied to the field of generative modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A three-stage hybrid framework using YOLOv11 and Donut-based VLMs for automated interpretation of 2D multi-view engineering drawings, achieving high accuracy in layout segmentation and semantic content parsing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual interpretation of complex engineering drawings with dense annotations is challenging due to varied layouts, orientations, and mixed symbolic-textual content, requiring automated solutions.

Method: Three-stage approach: 1) YOLOv11-det for layout segmentation, 2) YOLOv11-obb for orientation-aware annotation detection, 3) Two Donut-based VLMs (Alphabetical and Numerical) for semantic content parsing from localized regions.

Result: Alphabetical VLM achieved F1 score of 0.672 for textual/categorical data, Numerical VLM achieved 0.963 for quantitative data. Developed specialized datasets (1,000 drawings for layout, 1,406 for annotations).

Conclusion: The framework provides scalable automated interpretation of engineering drawings with unified JSON output for CAD/manufacturing integration, addressing challenges in multi-view drawing analysis.

Abstract: Engineering drawings are fundamental to manufacturing communication, serving
as the primary medium for conveying design intent, tolerances, and production
details. However, interpreting complex multi-view drawings with dense
annotations remains challenging using manual methods, generic optical character
recognition (OCR) systems, or traditional deep learning approaches, due to
varied layouts, orientations, and mixed symbolic-textual content. To address
these challenges, this paper proposes a three-stage hybrid framework for the
automated interpretation of 2D multi-view engineering drawings using modern
detection and vision language models (VLMs). In the first stage, YOLOv11-det
performs layout segmentation to localize key regions such as views, title
blocks, and notes. The second stage uses YOLOv11-obb for orientation-aware,
fine-grained detection of annotations, including measures, GD&T symbols, and
surface roughness indicators. The third stage employs two Donut-based, OCR-free
VLMs for semantic content parsing: the Alphabetical VLM extracts textual and
categorical information from title blocks and notes, while the Numerical VLM
interprets quantitative data such as measures, GD&T frames, and surface
roughness. Two specialized datasets were developed to ensure robustness and
generalization: 1,000 drawings for layout detection and 1,406 for
annotation-level training. The Alphabetical VLM achieved an overall F1 score of
0.672, while the Numerical VLM reached 0.963, demonstrating strong performance
in textual and quantitative interpretation, respectively. The unified JSON
output enables seamless integration with CAD and manufacturing databases,
providing a scalable solution for intelligent engineering drawing analysis.

*Xin Lu,Chuanqing Zhuang,Chenxi Jin,Zhengda Lu,Yiqun Wang,Wu Liu,Jun Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LSF-Animation is a speech-driven 3D facial animation framework that implicitly extracts emotion from speech and identity from neutral facial meshes, eliminating the need for explicit emotion/identity labels and improving generalization to unseen speakers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing emotion-aware facial animation methods rely on explicit one-hot encodings for identity and emotion, which limits generalization to unseen speakers and neglects emotional cues naturally present in speech.

Method: Proposes LSF-Animation framework that implicitly extracts emotion from speech and identity from neutral facial meshes, and introduces Hierarchical Interaction Fusion Block (HIFB) to integrate emotional, motion, and identity cues using a fusion token.

Result: Extensive experiments on 3DMEAD dataset show superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in emotional expressiveness, identity generalization, and animation realism.

Conclusion: LSF-Animation provides a more natural and adaptable approach to speech-driven 3D facial animation by eliminating explicit label dependencies and better leveraging inherent speech cues.

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation has attracted increasing interest since its
potential to generate expressive and temporally synchronized digital humans.
While recent works have begun to explore emotion-aware animation, they still
depend on explicit one-hot encodings to represent identity and emotion with
given emotion and identity labels, which limits their ability to generalize to
unseen speakers. Moreover, the emotional cues inherently present in speech are
often neglected, limiting the naturalness and adaptability of generated
animations. In this work, we propose LSF-Animation, a novel framework that
eliminates the reliance on explicit emotion and identity feature
representations. Specifically, LSF-Animation implicitly extracts emotion
information from speech and captures the identity features from a neutral
facial mesh, enabling improved generalization to unseen speakers and emotional
states without requiring manual labels. Furthermore, we introduce a
Hierarchical Interaction Fusion Block (HIFB), which employs a fusion token to
integrate dual transformer features and more effectively integrate emotional,
motion-related and identity-related cues. Extensive experiments conducted on
the 3DMEAD dataset demonstrate that our method surpasses recent
state-of-the-art approaches in terms of emotional expressiveness, identity
generalization, and animation realism. The source code will be released at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WM-MoE is a world model-based motion forecasting framework that addresses corner-case scenarios in autonomous driving by unifying perception, memory, and decision making, leveraging LLMs for temporal reasoning and MoE for scenario decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion forecasting models underperform in safety-critical corner cases due to over-representation of common scenes in training data and limited generalization capabilities, creating safety risks for autonomous vehicles.

Method: The framework constructs compact scene representations, uses LLMs with temporal tokenizers for long-horizon reasoning, employs mixture-of-experts to decompose corner cases into subproblems, and includes specialized experts for intent inference and counterfactual rollouts.

Result: WM-MoE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across four benchmark datasets (nuScenes, NGSIM, HighD, MoCAD) and remains robust under corner-case and data-missing conditions.

Conclusion: World model-based architectures show promise for robust and generalizable motion forecasting in autonomous vehicles, particularly for handling challenging corner-case scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable motion forecasting is essential for the safe deployment
of autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in rare but safety-critical
scenarios known as corner cases. Existing models often underperform in these
situations due to an over-representation of common scenes in training data and
limited generalization capabilities. To address this limitation, we present
WM-MoE, the first world model-based motion forecasting framework that unifies
perception, temporal memory, and decision making to address the challenges of
high-risk corner-case scenarios. The model constructs a compact scene
representation that explains current observations, anticipates future dynamics,
and evaluates the outcomes of potential actions. To enhance long-horizon
reasoning, we leverage large language models (LLMs) and introduce a lightweight
temporal tokenizer that maps agent trajectories and contextual cues into the
LLM's feature space without additional training, enriching temporal context and
commonsense priors. Furthermore, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) is introduced to
decompose complex corner cases into subproblems and allocate capacity across
scenario types, and a router assigns scenes to specialized experts that infer
agent intent and perform counterfactual rollouts. In addition, we introduce
nuScenes-corner, a new benchmark that comprises four real-world corner-case
scenarios for rigorous evaluation. Extensive experiments on four benchmark
datasets (nuScenes, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD) showcase that WM-MoE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines and remains robust under
corner-case and data-missing conditions, indicating the promise of world
model-based architectures for robust and generalizable motion forecasting in
fully AVs.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the feasibility of extreme quantization for large multimodal models, supporting effective and efficient deployment on resource-constrained devices while preserving model performance.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in image-text contrastive

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPRINT enables up to 75% token dropping in Diffusion Transformers while maintaining quality through sparse-dense residual fusion and two-stage training, achieving 9.8x training savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers have quadratic training costs that make large-scale pretraining prohibitively expensive, and existing token dropping methods either degrade quality or are parameter-heavy.

Method: Uses sparse-dense residual fusion where early layers process all tokens for local detail, deeper layers operate on sparse subsets, and outputs are fused via residuals. Follows two-stage training: masked pre-training for efficiency and full-token fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves 9.8x training savings on ImageNet-1K 256x256 with comparable FID/FDD, and Path-Drop Guidance at inference nearly halves FLOPs while improving quality.

Conclusion: SPRINT provides a simple, effective, and general solution for efficient DiT training through aggressive token dropping without quality degradation.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) deliver state-of-the-art generative performance
but their quadratic training cost with sequence length makes large-scale
pretraining prohibitively expensive. Token dropping can reduce training cost,
yet na\"ive strategies degrade representations, and existing methods are either
parameter-heavy or fail at high drop ratios. We present SPRINT, Sparse--Dense
Residual Fusion for Efficient Diffusion Transformers, a simple method that
enables aggressive token dropping (up to 75%) while preserving quality. SPRINT
leverages the complementary roles of shallow and deep layers: early layers
process all tokens to capture local detail, deeper layers operate on a sparse
subset to cut computation, and their outputs are fused through residual
connections. Training follows a two-stage schedule: long masked pre-training
for efficiency followed by short full-token fine-tuning to close the
train--inference gap. On ImageNet-1K 256x256, SPRINT achieves 9.8x training
savings with comparable FID/FDD, and at inference, its Path-Drop Guidance (PDG)
nearly halves FLOPs while improving quality. These results establish SPRINT as
a simple, effective, and general solution for efficient DiT training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lite-Diff is a lightweight diffusion model adaptation method that uses residual adapter modules, a latent morphological autoencoder, and pixel-level discriminator to efficiently fine-tune diffusion models for specialized domains like medical imaging with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning diffusion models for specialized domains is challenging due to limited domain-specific data and high computational costs of full model adaptation.

Method: Integrates lightweight adaptation layers into frozen diffusion U-Net, uses latent morphological autoencoder for domain-specific latent consistency and pixel-level discriminator for adversarial alignment, while freezing base model weights and optimizing only small residual adapter modules.

Result: Achieves superior adaptation efficiency compared to naive full fine-tuning on three chest X-ray datasets, with reduced computational overhead and mitigated overfitting in minimal-data settings.

Conclusion: Provides a promising direction for transfer learning in diffusion models, facilitating deployment in diverse low-data domains.

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in
high-fidelity image synthesis. However, fine-tuning these models for
specialized domains, such as medical imaging, remains challenging due to
limited domain-specific data and the high computational cost of full model
adaptation. In this paper, we introduce Lite-Diff (Lightweight Diffusion Model
Adaptation), a novel finetuning approach that integrates lightweight adaptation
layers into a frozen diffusion U-Net while enhancing training with a latent
morphological autoencoder (for domain-specific latent consistency) and a pixel
level discriminator(for adversarial alignment). By freezing weights of the base
model and optimizing only small residual adapter modules, LiteDiff
significantly reduces the computational overhead and mitigates overfitting,
even in minimal-data settings. Additionally, we conduct ablation studies to
analyze the effects of selectively integrating adaptation layers in different
U-Net blocks, revealing an optimal balance between efficiency and performance.
Experiments on three chest X-ray datasets - (1) Kaggle Chest X-Ray Pneumonia,
(2) NIH Chest X-ray14 and (3) VinBigData Chest X_ray demonstrate that LiteDiff
achieves superior adaptation efficiency compared to naive full fine-tuning. Our
framework provides a promising direction for transfer learning in diffusion
models, facilitating their deployment in diverse low data domains.

*Or Ronai,Vladimir Kulikov,Tomer Michaeli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowOpt is a zero-order optimization framework for flow-matching models that enables efficient optimization through the entire sampling path without backpropagation, achieving state-of-the-art results in image editing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for controlled generation in diffusion and flow-matching models are computationally impractical due to the iterative nature of sampling, requiring gradient-based optimization at each timestep separately.

Method: FlowOpt treats the entire flow process as a black box and uses zero-order (gradient-free) optimization to optimize through the whole sampling path without backpropagation through the model.

Result: FlowOpt achieves state-of-the-art results in image editing tasks (inversion and direct steering) while using roughly the same number of neural function evaluations as existing methods, with guaranteed convergence under proper step-size conditions.

Conclusion: FlowOpt provides an efficient and practical optimization framework for flow-matching models that enables monitoring intermediate results and early stopping, making it suitable for real-time image editing applications.

Abstract: The remarkable success of diffusion and flow-matching models has ignited a
surge of works on adapting them at test time for controlled generation tasks.
Examples range from image editing to restoration, compression and
personalization. However, due to the iterative nature of the sampling process
in those models, it is computationally impractical to use gradient-based
optimization to directly control the image generated at the end of the process.
As a result, existing methods typically resort to manipulating each timestep
separately. Here we introduce FlowOpt - a zero-order (gradient-free)
optimization framework that treats the entire flow process as a black box,
enabling optimization through the whole sampling path without backpropagation
through the model. Our method is both highly efficient and allows users to
monitor the intermediate optimization results and perform early stopping if
desired. We prove a sufficient condition on FlowOpt's step-size, under which
convergence to the global optimum is guaranteed. We further show how to
empirically estimate this upper bound so as to choose an appropriate step-size.
We demonstrate how FlowOpt can be used for image editing, showcasing two
options: (i) inversion (determining the initial noise that generates a given
image), and (ii) directly steering the edited image to be similar to the source
image while conforming to a target text prompt. In both cases, FlowOpt achieves
state-of-the-art results while using roughly the same number of neural function
evaluations (NFEs) as existing methods. Code and examples are available on the
project's webpage.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a caption-based XAI method that integrates standalone models into CLIP using network surgery to identify dominant concepts in predictions, improving model robustness against covariate shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current saliency map XAI methods can be misleading when spurious and salient features overlap in pixel space, highlighting the need for more robust explanation methods.

Method: Integrates standalone models into CLIP using novel network surgery approach to create caption-based XAI that identifies dominant concepts contributing to predictions.

Result: The proposed method minimizes the risk of models falling for covariate shifts and provides more reliable explanations by focusing on dominant concepts rather than pixel-level features.

Conclusion: Caption-based XAI through CLIP integration offers a more robust approach to model interpretation, significantly contributing to developing reliable machine learning systems.

Abstract: Robustness has become one of the most critical problems in machine learning
(ML). The science of interpreting ML models to understand their behavior and
improve their robustness is referred to as explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI). One of the state-of-the-art XAI methods for computer vision problems is
to generate saliency maps. A saliency map highlights the pixel space of an
image that excites the ML model the most. However, this property could be
misleading if spurious and salient features are present in overlapping pixel
spaces. In this paper, we propose a caption-based XAI method, which integrates
a standalone model to be explained into the contrastive language-image
pre-training (CLIP) model using a novel network surgery approach. The resulting
caption-based XAI model identifies the dominant concept that contributes the
most to the models prediction. This explanation minimizes the risk of the
standalone model falling for a covariate shift and contributes significantly
towards developing robust ML models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models are increasingly used to evaluate multimodal content like presentation slides, but their slide-specific understanding capabilities remain underexplored despite their growing role in agentic pipelines.

Method: Introduces VLM-SlideEval framework that probes VLMs along three axes: element-level extraction from slide images, robustness to controlled perturbations (geometry, style, text), and higher-level comprehension including narrative order recovery. Uses publicly available decks from Zenodo with standardized ground-truth metadata from PowerPoint XML.

Result: VLMs underperform on pixel-accurate extraction, show non-trivial agreement/fidelity/consistency under perturbations, perform better on single-slide content understanding, but do not reliably capture narrative structure across slides.

Conclusion: Current VLMs have significant limitations for slide evaluation, motivating the need for calibrated, critic-in-the-loop evaluators that drive iterative refinement in agentic pipelines.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate multimodal
content, including presentation slides, yet their slide-specific understanding
remains underexplored {despite their growing role as critics in agentic,
model-forward pipelines}. We introduce VLM-SlideEval, an evaluation framework
that probes VLMs along three axes: (1) element-level extraction from slide
images aligned to ground truth; (2) robustness to controlled perturbations in
geometry, style, and text; and (3) higher-level comprehension, such as
recovering a deck's narrative order from shuffled slides. Using publicly
available decks from Zenodo
(https://huggingface.co/datasets/Forceless/Zenodo10K/viewer/default/pptx), we
standardize ground-truth element metadata from PowerPoint XML and live
renderings into a unified, verifiable schema. Empirically, VLMs underperform on
pixel-accurate extraction and show non-trivial agreement, fidelity, and
consistency under controlled perturbations, while performing better on
single-slide content understanding; however, they do not reliably capture
narrative structure across slides. These results highlight the limits of
current VLMs for slide evaluation and motivate calibrated, critic-in-the-loop
evaluators that drive iterative refinement and selection in agentic pipelines.

TL;DR: A robust deep learning framework for multi-class anomaly detection in surveillance videos that uses human-centric preprocessing with YOLO-World and ByteTrack to focus on foreground content, followed by spatio-temporal modeling with InceptionV3 and BiLSTM, achieving 92.41% accuracy on UCF-Crime dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in surveillance video anomaly detection including diversity of abnormal events, class imbalance, and scene-dependent visual clutter by focusing on behaviorally relevant foreground content.

Method: Human-centric preprocessing using YOLO-World for human detection and ByteTrack for identity-aware tracking, with background suppression via Gaussian blurring. Spatial feature extraction with InceptionV3 and temporal modeling with bidirectional LSTM for sequence classification.

Result: Achieved 92.41% mean test accuracy across three trials on five-class UCF-Crime subset (Normal, Burglary, Fighting, Arson, Explosion), with per-class F1-scores consistently exceeding 0.85. Strong generalization and resilience to class imbalance demonstrated through comprehensive metrics.

Conclusion: Foreground-focused preprocessing significantly enhances anomaly discrimination in real-world surveillance scenarios, confirming the effectiveness of human-centric preprocessing combined with spatio-temporal modeling for robust anomaly detection.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in surveillance videos remains a challenging task due to
the diversity of abnormal events, class imbalance, and scene-dependent visual
clutter. To address these issues, we propose a robust deep learning framework
that integrates human-centric preprocessing with spatio-temporal modeling for
multi-class anomaly classification. Our pipeline begins by applying YOLO-World
- an open-vocabulary vision-language detector - to identify human instances in
raw video clips, followed by ByteTrack for consistent identity-aware tracking.
Background regions outside detected bounding boxes are suppressed via Gaussian
blurring, effectively reducing scene-specific distractions and focusing the
model on behaviorally relevant foreground content. The refined frames are then
processed by an ImageNet-pretrained InceptionV3 network for spatial feature
extraction, and temporal dynamics are captured using a bidirectional LSTM
(BiLSTM) for sequence-level classification. Evaluated on a five-class subset of
the UCF-Crime dataset (Normal, Burglary, Fighting, Arson, Explosion), our
method achieves a mean test accuracy of 92.41% across three independent trials,
with per-class F1-scores consistently exceeding 0.85. Comprehensive evaluation
metrics - including confusion matrices, ROC curves, and macro/weighted averages
- demonstrate strong generalization and resilience to class imbalance. The
results confirm that foreground-focused preprocessing significantly enhances
anomaly discrimination in real-world surveillance scenarios.

TL;DR: GIFT is a method that reduces hallucination in VLMs by using gaze shifts to create visual saliency maps, which guide attention to relevant visual regions and user queries during decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs often generate hallucinated content due to over-reliance on linguistic priors and visual attention sink problems where attention is misallocated to irrelevant regions, while existing methods fail to balance cross-modal fusion.

Method: GIFT pre-computes holistic visual saliency maps by tracking positive changes in visual attention (gaze shifts) during query comprehension, then amplifies attention to both salient visual information and user queries at each decoding step.

Result: GIFT achieves up to 20.7% improvement over greedy decoding in mitigating hallucination across generative and classification tasks, while maintaining general vision-language performance with low computational overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed GIFT method effectively addresses visual attention sink and cross-modal fusion imbalance, significantly reducing hallucination in VLMs through gaze shift-guided attention enhancement.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) often generate hallucination, i.e., content
that cannot be substantiated by either textual or visual inputs. Prior work
primarily attributes this to over-reliance on linguistic prior knowledge rather
than visual inputs. Some methods attempt to mitigate hallucination by
amplifying visual token attention proportionally to their attention scores.
However, these methods overlook the visual attention sink problem, where
attention is frequently misallocated to task-irrelevant visual regions, and
neglect cross-modal fusion balance by enhancing only visual attention without
adjusting attention to the user query. This can result in amplifying incorrect
areas while failing to properly interpret the user query. To address these
challenges, we propose a simple yet effective method called Gaze Shift-Guided
Cross-modal Fusion Enhancement (GIFT). GIFT pre-computes a holistic visual
saliency map by tracking positive changes in visual attention, or "gaze
shifts", during user query comprehension, and leverages this map to amplify
attention to both salient visual information and the user query at each
decoding step. This reduces the impact of visual attention sink, as irrelevant
tokens exhibit minimal shifts, while ensuring balanced cross-modal fusion for
well-integrated representation. Extensive experiments show that GIFT
effectively mitigates hallucination in VLMs across both generative and
classification tasks, achieving up to 20.7% improvement over greedy decoding,
while maintaining general vision-language performance with low computational
overhead.

*Luca Caldera,Lara Cavinato,Francesca Ieva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel image-based harmonization framework for 3D T1-weighted brain MRI that disentangles anatomical content from scanner/site variations using SSIM-based differentiable loss, improving cross-site consistency and downstream task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Variability from different MRI scanner models, acquisition protocols, and imaging sites hinders consistent analysis and generalizability across multicenter neuroimaging studies.

Method: Uses a differentiable Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) loss to separate anatomical content from scanner/site variations, enabling separate evaluation of luminance, contrast, and structural components. Trained on multiple public datasets with diverse scanners and sites.

Result: Harmonized images achieved strong alignment across acquisition settings: structural SSIM 0.97, luminance SSIM 0.98-0.99, reduced Wasserstein distances. Downstream improvements: brain age prediction MAE decreased from 5.36 to 3.30 years, Alzheimer's disease classification AUC increased from 0.78 to 0.85.

Conclusion: The framework enhances cross-site image consistency, preserves anatomical fidelity, and improves downstream model performance, providing a robust solution for large-scale multicenter neuroimaging studies.

Abstract: The variability introduced by differences in MRI scanner models, acquisition
protocols, and imaging sites hinders consistent analysis and generalizability
across multicenter studies. We present a novel image-based harmonization
framework for 3D T1-weighted brain MRI, which disentangles anatomical content
from scanner- and site-specific variations. The model incorporates a
differentiable loss based on the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) to preserve
biologically meaningful features while reducing inter-site variability. This
loss enables separate evaluation of image luminance, contrast, and structural
components. Training and validation were performed on multiple publicly
available datasets spanning diverse scanners and sites, with testing on both
healthy and clinical populations. Harmonization using multiple style targets,
including style-agnostic references, produced consistent and high-quality
outputs. Visual comparisons, voxel intensity distributions, and SSIM-based
metrics demonstrated that harmonized images achieved strong alignment across
acquisition settings while maintaining anatomical fidelity. Following
harmonization, structural SSIM reached 0.97, luminance SSIM ranged from 0.98 to
0.99, and Wasserstein distances between mean voxel intensity distributions
decreased substantially. Downstream tasks showed substantial improvements: mean
absolute error for brain age prediction decreased from 5.36 to 3.30 years, and
Alzheimer's disease classification AUC increased from 0.78 to 0.85. Overall,
our framework enhances cross-site image consistency, preserves anatomical
fidelity, and improves downstream model performance, providing a robust and
generalizable solution for large-scale multicenter neuroimaging studies.

### [58] [Mitigating Coordinate Prediction Bias from Positional Encoding Failures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22102)
*Xingjian Tao,Yiwei Wang,Yujun Cai,Yihong Luo,Jing Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs struggle with precise coordinate prediction in high-resolution images due to weakened positional encodings. The paper proposes VPSG, a training-free method that corrects directional biases by using shuffled positional encodings as negative guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs excel at vision-language tasks but fail at precise coordinate prediction, especially with high-resolution inputs that produce long token sequences and weaken positional encodings.

Method: Proposed Vision-PE Shuffle Guidance (VPSG) - a training-free test-time method that runs auxiliary decoding with shuffled visual positional encodings to isolate position-unconditioned tendencies, then uses this as negative evidence to guide digit prediction while preserving coordinate format.

Result: Experiments on ScreenSpot-Pro dataset demonstrate reliable improvements in coordinate prediction accuracy, showing that addressing positional encoding robustness is critical for spatial reasoning.

Conclusion: Positional encoding failures are a key bottleneck for accurate coordinate prediction at scale in MLLMs, and the proposed VPSG method effectively addresses this issue by leveraging directional bias patterns for correction.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at vision-language tasks such
as VQA and document understanding, yet precise coordinate prediction remains
challenging. High-resolution inputs exacerbate this difficulty by producing
long token sequences that weaken positional encodings and introduce directional
biases in coordinate outputs. We investigate this phenomenon by analyzing how
MLLMs behave when visual positional encodings (VPEs) are deliberately perturbed
through shuffling. Our analysis reveals that such perturbations induce
predictable, non-random coordinate biases rather than random errors, suggesting
that models rely on internal positional priors when spatial grounding signals
are degraded. Crucially, we observe similar directional error patterns in
natural high-resolution datasets, indicating that positional encoding failures
are a key bottleneck for accurate coordinate prediction at scale. To address
this issue, we propose Vision-PE Shuffle Guidance (VPSG), a training-free
test-time method that leverages the directional nature of these biases for
correction. VPSG runs auxiliary decoding with shuffled VPEs to isolate
position-unconditioned tendencies, then uses this as negative evidence to guide
digit prediction while preserving coordinate format through a lightweight
finite-state machine. Experiments on ScreenSpot-Pro demonstrate reliable
improvements, highlighting positional encoding robustness as a critical factor
for spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

TL;DR: Rainbow is a conditional image generation framework that decomposes input conditions into diverse latent representations using GFlowNets, enabling generation of multiple plausible images that capture inherent uncertainty in prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for generating diverse images either modify random seeds (making differences hard to interpret) or diversify input prompts (limited in verbal interpretability), failing to properly address condition uncertainty that leads to multiple plausible outputs.

Method: Rainbow integrates a latent graph parameterized by GFlowNets into prompt representation computation, leveraging GFlowNets' advanced graph sampling to produce multiple trajectories that represent diverse aspects of input condition uncertainty, leading to distinct condition representations and output images.

Result: Evaluations on natural image and medical image datasets show Rainbow improves both diversity and fidelity across image synthesis, image generation, and counterfactual generation tasks.

Conclusion: Rainbow effectively addresses inherent condition uncertainty in conditional image generation by decomposing input conditions into diverse latent representations using GFlowNets, enabling generation of multiple plausible and interpretable images.

Abstract: Capturing diversity is crucial in conditional and prompt-based image
generation, particularly when conditions contain uncertainty that can lead to
multiple plausible outputs. To generate diverse images reflecting this
diversity, traditional methods often modify random seeds, making it difficult
to discern meaningful differences between samples, or diversify the input
prompt, which is limited in verbally interpretable diversity. We propose
Rainbow, a novel conditional image generation framework, applicable to any
pretrained conditional generative model, that addresses inherent
condition/prompt uncertainty and generates diverse plausible images. Rainbow is
based on a simple yet effective idea: decomposing the input condition into
diverse latent representations, each capturing an aspect of the uncertainty and
generating a distinct image. First, we integrate a latent graph, parameterized
by Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets), into the prompt representation
computation. Second, leveraging GFlowNets' advanced graph sampling capabilities
to capture uncertainty and output diverse trajectories over the graph, we
produce multiple trajectories that collectively represent the input condition,
leading to diverse condition representations and corresponding output images.
Evaluations on natural image and medical image datasets demonstrate Rainbow's
improvement in both diversity and fidelity across image synthesis, image
generation, and counterfactual generation tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRAID is a framework that generates high-quality vision-language datasets for spatial reasoning by using 2D bounding boxes instead of 3D reconstruction or caption-based methods, achieving 91.16% human-validated accuracy compared to 57.6% from existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with spatial reasoning due to limitations in training data generation pipelines, which suffer from 3D reconstruction errors and generative hallucinations, resulting in low human validation rates.

Method: GRAID operates exclusively on 2D bounding boxes from standard object detectors to determine qualitative spatial relationships, avoiding both 3D reconstruction errors and generative hallucinations.

Result: Generated over 8.5 million high-quality VQA pairs across multiple datasets, achieving 91.16% human-validated accuracy. Models trained on GRAID data showed significant improvements in spatial reasoning, with 47.5% and 37.9% accuracy gains on different datasets.

Conclusion: GRAID provides a reliable method for generating high-quality spatial reasoning datasets that enable VLMs to learn generalizable spatial reasoning concepts, outperforming existing data generation approaches.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on many
vision-language tasks but often struggle with spatial reasoning\textemdash{}a
prerequisite for many applications. Empirically, we find that a dataset
produced by a current training data generation pipeline has a 57.6\% human
validation rate. These rates stem from current limitations: single-image 3D
reconstruction introduces cascading modeling errors and requires wide answer
tolerances, while caption-based methods require hyper-detailed annotations and
suffer from generative hallucinations. We present GRAID, built on the key
insight that qualitative spatial relationships can be reliably determined from
2D geometric primitives alone. By operating exclusively on 2D bounding boxes
from standard object detectors, GRAID avoids both 3D reconstruction errors and
generative hallucinations, resulting in datasets that are of higher quality
than existing tools that produce similar datasets as validated by human
evaluations. We apply our framework to the BDD100k, NuImages, and Waymo
datasets, generating over 8.5 million high-quality VQA pairs creating questions
spanning spatial relations, counting, ranking, and size comparisons. We
evaluate one of the datasets and find it achieves 91.16\% human-validated
accuracy\textemdash{}compared to 57.6\% on a dataset generated by recent work.
% or recent work Critically, we demonstrate that when trained on GRAID data,
models learn spatial reasoning concepts that generalize: models fine-tuned on 6
question types improve on over 10 held-out types, with accuracy gains of 47.5\%

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep stereo matching methods have advanced on benchmark datasets but lack the zero-shot generalization capabilities seen in foundation models for other vision tasks. Current approaches struggle with challenging regions like occlusions and weak textures that rely on dataset-specific priors.

Method: CogStereo embeds implicit spatial cognition into refinement using monocular depth features as priors to capture holistic scene understanding beyond local correspondences. It employs a dual-conditional refinement mechanism combining pixel-wise uncertainty with cognition-guided features for consistent global correction of mismatches.

Result: Extensive experiments on Scene Flow, KITTI, Middlebury, ETH3D, EuRoc, and real-world datasets demonstrate that CogStereo achieves state-of-the-art results and excels in cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: CogStereo shifts stereo vision towards a cognition-driven approach by ensuring structurally coherent disparity estimation even in areas where geometry alone is inadequate, without relying on dataset-specific priors.

### [62] [Mint: A Simple Test-Time Adaptation of Vision-Language Models against Common Corruptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22127)
*Wenxuan Bao,Ruxi Deng,Jingrui He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP models suffer from embedding variance collapse under distribution shifts, where both intra-class and inter-class variances decrease with corruption severity. The proposed Mint method maximizes pseudo-label-based inter-class variance at test time to improve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pretrained vision-language models like CLIP show strong zero-shot generalization but are vulnerable to distribution shifts caused by input corruptions. The authors investigate how corruptions affect CLIP's image embeddings and discover embedding variance collapse.

Method: The authors propose Mint, a test-time adaptation method that maximizes pseudo-label-based inter-class variance using a mean accumulator and gradient accumulator. It operates effectively with small batch sizes and requires no prior knowledge of corruption types.

Result: Mint consistently improves performance across multiple corruption benchmarks and CLIP architectures, demonstrating enhanced embedding quality and robustness to distribution shifts.

Conclusion: Embedding variance collapse explains CLIP's vulnerability to corruptions, and maximizing inter-class variance through test-time adaptation effectively mitigates this issue, providing a simple yet powerful approach to improve model robustness.

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot
generalization but remain vulnerable to distribution shifts caused by input
corruptions. In this work, we investigate how corruptions affect CLIP's image
embeddings and uncover a consistent phenomenon we term as embedding variance
collapse, where both intra-class and inter-class variances shrink as corruption
severity increases. We find that this collapse is closely tied to performance
degradation, with inter-class variance strongly correlated with classification
accuracy. To explain this phenomenon, we analyze how corruptions alter the
structure of the embedding space. Our theoretical results suggest that the
visual encoder tends to encode corruption-related signals, which dilute
class-discriminative features and compress the representation geometry. We
further show that maximizing inter-class variance, even when estimated from
pseudo-labels, can provably enhance embedding quality. Based on this insight,
we propose Mint, a simple test-time adaptation method that maximizes
pseudo-label-based inter-class variance on the fly using a mean accumulator and
a gradient accumulator. Mint operates effectively with small batch sizes and
consistently improves performance across multiple corruption benchmarks and
CLIP architectures. Our code is available at https://github.com/baowenxuan/Mint .

TL;DR: The paper introduces egoEMOTION, the first dataset combining egocentric visual and physiological signals with emotion and personality data, enabling affect-driven behavior modeling in egocentric vision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current egocentric vision benchmarks ignore emotional states that shape human behavior, focusing only on physical activities and assuming neutral affect, which limits understanding of internal behavioral drivers.

Method: Created egoEMOTION dataset with 50+ hours of recordings from 43 participants using Meta's Project Aria glasses, capturing synchronized eye-tracking video, photoplethysmography, motion data, and physiological baselines with self-reported emotion and personality data.

Result: A classical learning-based method showed better affect prediction from egocentric vision signals than from physiological signals alone, establishing emotion and personality as core dimensions in egocentric perception.

Conclusion: The dataset opens new directions for affect-driven modeling of behavior, intent, and interaction in egocentric vision systems.

Abstract: Understanding affect is central to anticipating human behavior, yet current
egocentric vision benchmarks largely ignore the person's emotional states that
shape their decisions and actions. Existing tasks in egocentric perception
focus on physical activities, hand-object interactions, and attention modeling
- assuming neutral affect and uniform personality. This limits the ability of
vision systems to capture key internal drivers of behavior. In this paper, we
present egoEMOTION, the first dataset that couples egocentric visual and
physiological signals with dense self-reports of emotion and personality across
controlled and real-world scenarios. Our dataset includes over 50 hours of
recordings from 43 participants, captured using Meta's Project Aria glasses.
Each session provides synchronized eye-tracking video, headmounted
photoplethysmography, inertial motion data, and physiological baselines for
reference. Participants completed emotion-elicitation tasks and naturalistic
activities while self-reporting their affective state using the Circumplex
Model and Mikels' Wheel as well as their personality via the Big Five model. We
define three benchmark tasks: (1) continuous affect classification (valence,
arousal, dominance); (2) discrete emotion classification; and (3) trait-level
personality inference. We show that a classical learning-based method, as a
simple baseline in real-world affect prediction, produces better estimates from
signals captured on egocentric vision systems than processing physiological
signals. Our dataset establishes emotion and personality as core dimensions in
egocentric perception and opens new directions in affect-driven modeling of
behavior, intent, and interaction.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create realistic animatable human avatars for human-robot interaction and virtual experiences, addressing limitations of existing 3DGS-based methods in accurately representing detailed non-rigid features and dynamic regions.

Method: Proposes a rigid-nonrigid coupled deformation framework integrating Spacetime Gaussians (STG) with linear blend skinning (LBS), where LBS handles global pose transformations and STG provides spacetime adaptive optimization, plus optical flow-guided adaptive densification for high-dynamic regions.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both reconstruction quality and operational efficiency, achieving superior quantitative metrics while maintaining real-time rendering capabilities.

Conclusion: STG-Avatar successfully addresses the challenges of representing detailed non-rigid features and dynamic regions in human avatar reconstruction, providing a high-fidelity and efficient solution for animatable human avatars.

Abstract: Realistic animatable human avatars from monocular videos are crucial for
advancing human-robot interaction and enhancing immersive virtual experiences.
While recent research on 3DGS-based human avatars has made progress, it still
struggles with accurately representing detailed features of non-rigid objects
(e.g., clothing deformations) and dynamic regions (e.g., rapidly moving limbs).
To address these challenges, we present STG-Avatar, a 3DGS-based framework for
high-fidelity animatable human avatar reconstruction. Specifically, our
framework introduces a rigid-nonrigid coupled deformation framework that
synergistically integrates Spacetime Gaussians (STG) with linear blend skinning
(LBS). In this hybrid design, LBS enables real-time skeletal control by driving
global pose transformations, while STG complements it through spacetime
adaptive optimization of 3D Gaussians. Furthermore, we employ optical flow to
identify high-dynamic regions and guide the adaptive densification of 3D
Gaussians in these regions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both reconstruction
quality and operational efficiency, achieving superior quantitative metrics
while retaining real-time rendering capabilities. Our code is available at

Motivation: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise for open-set challenges but face limitations in 3D scene understanding due to scarce 3D datasets, motivating a general framework that leverages language guidance.

Method: For self-supervised tasks, LOC fuses multi-frame LiDAR points, uses Poisson reconstruction to fill voids, assigns semantics via KNN, and introduces Densely Contrastive Learning (DCL) to mitigate feature over-homogenization by leveraging dense voxel semantics and textual prompts.

Result: Experiments on nuScenes show superior performance, achieving high-precision predictions for known classes and distinguishing unknown classes without extra training data.

Conclusion: LOC effectively bridges the gap in 3D scene understanding by integrating language guidance and contrastive learning, enabling robust open-set recognition in 3D environments.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown significant progress in open-set
challenges. However, the limited availability of 3D datasets hinders their
effective application in 3D scene understanding. We propose LOC, a general
language-guided framework adaptable to various occupancy networks, supporting
both supervised and self-supervised learning paradigms. For self-supervised
tasks, we employ a strategy that fuses multi-frame LiDAR points for
dynamic/static scenes, using Poisson reconstruction to fill voids, and
assigning semantics to voxels via K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to obtain
comprehensive voxel representations. To mitigate feature over-homogenization
caused by direct high-dimensional feature distillation, we introduce Densely
Contrastive Learning (DCL). DCL leverages dense voxel semantic information and
predefined textual prompts. This efficiently enhances open-set recognition
without dense pixel-level supervision, and our framework can also leverage
existing ground truth to further improve performance. Our model predicts dense
voxel features embedded in the CLIP feature space, integrating textual and
image pixel information, and classifies based on text and semantic similarity.
Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the method's superior
performance, achieving high-precision predictions for known classes and
distinguishing unknown classes without additional training data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ARFNet, a contrastive learning framework for source-free domain adaptation that addresses negative transfer and domain shift through attention residual fusion, global-local attention contrast, and dynamic centroid evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SFDA methods focus on domain shift but neglect negative transfer effects that hinder model performance improvement during adaptation.

Method: Uses attention mechanism to capture discriminative regions, decomposes attention features into spatial-wise and channel-wise for cross-layer fusion and self-distillation, contrasts global-local representations to improve category perception, and employs dynamic centroid evaluation for trustworthy pseudo-labels.

Result: Achieves superior performance across five benchmarks of varying scales, surpassing other SFDA techniques.

Conclusion: ARFNet effectively alleviates negative transfer and domain shift in SFDA through its attention-based contrastive learning framework and centroid evaluation strategy.

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) involves training a model on source
domain and then applying it to a related target domain without access to the
source data and labels during adaptation. The complexity of scene information
and lack of the source domain make SFDA a difficult task. Recent studies have
shown promising results, but many approaches to domain adaptation concentrate
on domain shift and neglect the effects of negative transfer, which may impede
enhancements of model performance during adaptation. n this paper, addressing
this issue, we propose a novel framework of Attention Residual Fusion Network
(ARFNet) based on contrast learning for SFDA to alleviate negative transfer and
domain shift during the progress of adaptation, in which attention residual
fusion, global-local attention contrast, and dynamic centroid evaluation are
exploited. Concretely, the attention mechanism is first exploited to capture
the discriminative region of the target object. Then, in each block, attention
features are decomposed into spatial-wise and channel-wise attentions to
achieve the cross-layer attention residual fusion progressively and
self-distillation. During adaptation progress, we contrast global and local
representations to improve the perceptual capabilities of different categories,
which enables the model to discriminate variations between inner-class and
intra-class. Finally, a dynamic centroid evaluation strategy is exploited to
evaluate the trustworthy centroids and labels for self-supervised
self-distillation, which aims to accurately approximate the center of the
source domain and pseudo-labels to mitigate domain shift. To validate the
efficacy, we execute comprehensive experiments on five benchmarks of varying
scales. Experimental outcomes indicate that our method surpasses other
techniques, attaining superior performance across SFDA benchmarks.

TL;DR: I2-NeRF is a neural radiance field framework that enhances 3D metric perception under media degradation through reverse-stratified upsampling and a unified radiative formulation for complex media environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To endow generative AI with 3D physical world perception and address limitations of existing NeRF models that rely on object-centric sampling, which struggles with media degradation in environments like underwater, haze, and low-light scenes.

Method: Introduces reverse-stratified upsampling for near-uniform 3D space sampling to preserve isometry, and presents a general radiative formulation unifying emission, absorption, and scattering using Beer-Lambert attenuation law for media degradation modeling.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show significant improvements in both reconstruction fidelity and physical plausibility compared to existing approaches, with the ability to estimate medium properties like water depth.

Conclusion: I2-NeRF enables isotropic metric perception in complex media environments by treating light propagation uniformly in all directions, representing an advancement in 3D physical world perception for generative AI.

Abstract: Participating in efforts to endow generative AI with the 3D physical world
perception, we propose I2-NeRF, a novel neural radiance field framework that
enhances isometric and isotropic metric perception under media degradation.
While existing NeRF models predominantly rely on object-centric sampling,
I2-NeRF introduces a reverse-stratified upsampling strategy to achieve
near-uniform sampling across 3D space, thereby preserving isometry. We further
present a general radiative formulation for media degradation that unifies
emission, absorption, and scattering into a particle model governed by the
Beer-Lambert attenuation law. By composing the direct and media-induced
in-scatter radiance, this formulation extends naturally to complex media
environments such as underwater, haze, and even low-light scenes. By treating
light propagation uniformly in both vertical and horizontal directions, I2-NeRF
enables isotropic metric perception and can even estimate medium properties
such as water depth. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly improves both reconstruction fidelity and physical
plausibility compared to existing approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HARMONY is a novel uncertainty estimation framework for vision-language models that jointly leverages multimodal activations and output probabilities to assess response reliability, outperforming existing methods on VQA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing uncertainty estimation methods for VLMs either rely solely on output probability distributions or hidden representations, failing to capture complex multimodal relationships and being influenced by language priors, which limits their reliability assessment in high-stakes applications.

Method: Proposes HARMONY framework that jointly utilizes fused multimodal information from model activations and output token probability distributions to determine response reliability, capturing both internal visual understanding beliefs and output confidence.

Result: Experimental results on A-OKVQA, VizWiz, and PathVQA benchmarks with LLaVa-7b, LLaVA-13b and InstructBLIP show consistent performance improvements, achieving up to 4% AUROC and 6% PRR gains over existing approaches.

Conclusion: HARMONY establishes new state-of-the-art in uncertainty estimation for VLMs by effectively combining multimodal activations and output distributions, demonstrating superior reliability assessment for vision-language generation tasks.

Abstract: The growing deployment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in high-stakes
applications such as autonomous driving and assistive technologies for visually
impaired individuals necessitates reliable mechanisms to assess the
trustworthiness of their generation. Uncertainty Estimation (UE) plays a
central role in quantifying the reliability of model outputs and reducing
unsafe generations via selective prediction. In this regard, most existing
probability-based UE approaches rely on output probability distributions,
aggregating token probabilities into a single uncertainty score using
predefined functions such as length-normalization. Another line of research
leverages model hidden representations and trains MLP-based models to predict
uncertainty. However, these methods often fail to capture the complex
multimodal relationships between semantic and textual tokens and struggle to
identify biased probabilities often influenced by language priors. Motivated by
these observations, we propose a novel UE framework, HARMONY, that jointly
leverages fused multimodal information in model activations and the output
distribution of the VLM to determine the reliability of responses. The key
hypothesis of our work is that both the model's internal belief in its visual
understanding, captured by its hidden representations, and the produced token
probabilities carry valuable reliability signals that can be jointly leveraged
to improve UE performance, surpassing approaches that rely on only one of these
components. Experimental results on three open-ended VQA benchmarks, A-OKVQA,

*Vincent Lu,Aaron Truong,Zeyu Yun,Yubei Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A simple non-parametric generative model based on natural image principles produces compelling results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 without training, offering mechanistic insights into generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the opaque mechanisms of complex image generative models by proposing a simple, interpretable alternative that reveals fundamental principles of natural image structure.

Method: A non-parametric generative model grounded in three natural image principles: spatial non-stationarity, low-level regularities, and high-level semantics, where each pixel's distribution is defined from its local context window without any training.

Result: The model produces high-fidelity samples on MNIST and visually compelling CIFAR-10 images despite minimal architecture and no training, demonstrating strong empirical performance.

Conclusion: The model's white-box nature provides mechanistic understanding of generalization through compositional "part-whole generalization", suggesting a hypothesis for how large neural networks learn to generalize.

Abstract: Scaling and architectural advances have produced strikingly photorealistic
image generative models, yet their mechanisms still remain opaque. Rather than
advancing scaling, our goal is to strip away complicated engineering tricks and
propose a simple, non-parametric generative model. Our design is grounded in
three principles of natural images-(i) spatial non-stationarity, (ii) low-level
regularities, and (iii) high-level semantics-and defines each pixel's
distribution from its local context window. Despite its minimal architecture
and no training, the model produces high-fidelity samples on MNIST and visually
compelling CIFAR-10 images. This combination of simplicity and strong empirical
performance points toward a minimal theory of natural-image structure. The
model's white-box nature also allows us to have a mechanistic understanding of
how the model generalizes and generates diverse images. We study it by tracing
each generated pixel back to its source images. These analyses reveal a simple,
compositional procedure for "part-whole generalization", suggesting a
hypothesis for how large neural network generative models learn to generalize.

*Kunal Bhosikar,Siddharth Katageri,Vivek Madhavaram,Kai Han,Charu Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOGRAS is a large-scale dataset that bridges the gap between full-body motion generation and precise grasping in 3D scenes, enabling physically plausible human-scene interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either generate full-body motion without fine-grained grasping fidelity or create precise grasping motions without considering the surrounding 3D scene, creating a significant challenge for realistic human-scene interactions.

Method: Introduced MOGRAS dataset with pre-grasping full-body walking motions and final grasping poses in annotated 3D indoor scenes, and proposed a simple yet effective method to adapt existing approaches for scene-aware generation.

Result: The dataset enabled benchmarking of existing methods and revealed their limitations, while the proposed adaptation method achieved significant improvements in generating realistic full-body grasping motions within 3D scenes.

Conclusion: MOGRAS dataset and the proposed method pave the way for more realistic human-scene interactions by effectively bridging the gap between full-body motion generation and precise grasping in 3D environments.

Abstract: Generating realistic full-body motion interacting with objects is critical
for applications in robotics, virtual reality, and human-computer interaction.
While existing methods can generate full-body motion within 3D scenes, they
often lack the fidelity for fine-grained tasks like object grasping.
Conversely, methods that generate precise grasping motions typically ignore the
surrounding 3D scene. This gap, generating full-body grasping motions that are
physically plausible within a 3D scene, remains a significant challenge. To
address this, we introduce MOGRAS (Human MOtion with GRAsping in 3D Scenes), a
large-scale dataset that bridges this gap. MOGRAS provides pre-grasping
full-body walking motions and final grasping poses within richly annotated 3D
indoor scenes. We leverage MOGRAS to benchmark existing full-body grasping
methods and demonstrate their limitations in scene-aware generation.
Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method to adapt existing
approaches to work seamlessly within 3D scenes. Through extensive quantitative
and qualitative experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our dataset and
highlight the significant improvements our proposed method achieves, paving the
way for more realistic human-scene interactions.

### [72] [TrajGATFormer: A Graph-Based Transformer Approach for Worker and Obstacle Trajectory Prediction in Off-site Construction Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22205)
*Mohammed Alduais,Xinming Li,Qipei Mei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework using YOLOv10n and DeepSORT for worker and obstacle detection/tracking, with two novel trajectory prediction models (TrajGATFormer and TrajGATFormer-Obstacle) that integrate transformer encoder-decoder with Graph Attention Networks to improve collision risk assessment in construction sites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offsite construction introduces new safety risks due to close worker-machinery interactions. Traditional trajectory prediction methods struggle with dynamic construction environments and lack ability to capture long-term behavior and spatial-social context needed for collision risk assessment.

Method: Framework integrates YOLOv10n for object detection and DeepSORT for tracking, plus two novel models: TrajGATFormer (worker trajectory prediction) and TrajGATFormer-Obstacle (worker and obstacle prediction), both using transformer encoder-decoder with Graph Attention Networks to capture temporal and spatial interactions.

Result: TrajGATFormer achieved ADE of 1.25 m and FDE of 2.3 m over 4.8 s horizon. TrajGATFormer-Obstacle achieved higher accuracy with ADE 1.15 m and FDE 2.2 m. Both models outperformed traditional methods, reducing ADE and FDE by up to 35% and 38% respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses limitations of traditional methods by integrating advanced detection, tracking, and trajectory prediction models that capture complex spatial-temporal interactions, providing more accurate collision risk assessment for construction safety.

Abstract: As the demand grows within the construction industry for processes that are
not only faster but also safer and more efficient, offsite construction has
emerged as a solution, though it brings new safety risks due to the close
interaction between workers, machinery, and moving obstacles. Predicting the
future trajectories of workers and taking into account social and environmental
factors is a crucial step for developing collision-avoidance systems to
mitigate such risks. Traditional methods often struggle to adapt to the dynamic
and unpredictable nature of construction environments. Many rely on simplified
assumptions or require hand-crafted features, limiting their ability to respond
to complex, real-time interactions between workers and moving obstacles. While
recent data-driven methods have improved the modeling of temporal patterns,
they still face challenges in capturing long-term behavior and accounting for
the spatial and social context crucial to collision risk assessment. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a framework integrating YOLOv10n and
DeepSORT for precise detection and tracking, along with two novel trajectory
prediction models: TrajGATFormer and TrajGATFormer-Obstacle. YOLOv10n serves as
the backbone for object detection, accurately identifying workers and obstacles
in diverse scenes, while DeepSORT efficiently tracks them over time with unique
IDs for continuity. Both models employ a transformer encoder-decoder with Graph
Attention Networks (GAT) to capture temporal and spatial interactions.
TrajGATFormer predicts worker trajectories with an ADE of 1.25 m and FDE of 2.3
m over a 4.8 s horizon, while TrajGATFormer-Obstacle extends prediction to both
workers and obstacles, achieving higher accuracy (ADE 1.15 m, FDE 2.2 m).
Comparative analysis shows both models outperform traditional methods, reducing
ADE and FDE by up to 35% and 38%, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DynamicTree is the first framework for generating long-term interactive 3D Gaussian Splatting tree animations using a compact sparse voxel spectrum representation, enabling fast feed-forward motion generation and real-time responses to external forces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods face challenges in generating realistic 4D motion for complex real trees, which are needed for applications in virtual reality, games, and world simulation.

Method: Uses a compact sparse voxel spectrum to represent tree movement, generates mesh motion from 3D Gaussian Splatting trees, binds Gaussians to deform mesh, and enables fast modal analysis for real-time interactive responses to external forces.

Result: Achieves realistic and responsive tree animations, significantly outperforming existing approaches in both visual quality and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: DynamicTree provides an effective framework for generating dynamic 3D tree animations with superior performance compared to prior methods.

Abstract: Generating dynamic and interactive 3D objects, such as trees, has wide
applications in virtual reality, games, and world simulation. Nevertheless,
existing methods still face various challenges in generating realistic 4D
motion for complex real trees. In this paper, we propose DynamicTree, the first
framework that can generate long-term, interactive animation of 3D Gaussian
Splatting trees. Unlike prior optimization-based methods, our approach
generates dynamics in a fast feed-forward manner. The key success of our
approach is the use of a compact sparse voxel spectrum to represent the tree
movement. Given a 3D tree from Gaussian Splatting reconstruction, our pipeline
first generates mesh motion using the sparse voxel spectrum and then binds
Gaussians to deform the mesh. Additionally, the proposed sparse voxel spectrum
can also serve as a basis for fast modal analysis under external forces,
allowing real-time interactive responses. To train our model, we also introduce
4DTree, the first large-scale synthetic 4D tree dataset containing 8,786
animated tree meshes with semantic labels and 100-frame motion sequences.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves realistic and
responsive tree animations, significantly outperforming existing approaches in
both visual quality and computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes GALA, a Multi-Source Active Domain Adaptation method that combines global k-means clustering with cluster-wise local selection to selectively annotate target domain samples, achieving near-fully-supervised performance with only 1% target annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the performance gap between domain adaptation methods and fully supervised learning by selectively acquiring annotations from the target domain in multi-source settings.

Method: GALA strategy combining global k-means clustering for target-domain samples with cluster-wise local selection criterion to handle inter-class diversity and multi-source domain variation.

Result: Extensive experiments on three standard DA benchmarks show GALA consistently outperforms prior active learning and active DA methods, achieving performance comparable to fully-supervised upperbound with only 1% target annotations.

Conclusion: GALA is an effective plug-and-play solution for Multi-Source Active Domain Adaptation that can be seamlessly integrated into existing DA frameworks without additional parameters, significantly reducing annotation costs while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) provides an effective way to tackle target-domain
tasks by leveraging knowledge learned from source domains. Recent studies have
extended this paradigm to Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA), which exploits
multiple source domains carrying richer and more diverse transferable
information. However, a substantial performance gap still remains between
adaptation-based methods and fully supervised learning. In this paper, we
explore a more practical and challenging setting, named Multi-Source Active
Domain Adaptation (MS-ADA), to further enhance target-domain performance by
selectively acquiring annotations from the target domain. The key difficulty of
MS-ADA lies in designing selection criteria that can jointly handle inter-class
diversity and multi-source domain variation. To address these challenges, we
propose a simple yet effective GALA strategy (GALA), which combines a global
k-means clustering step for target-domain samples with a cluster-wise local
selection criterion, effectively tackling the above two issues in a
complementary manner. Our proposed GALA is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing DA frameworks without introducing any additional
trainable parameters. Extensive experiments on three standard DA benchmarks
demonstrate that GALA consistently outperforms prior active learning and active
DA methods, achieving performance comparable to the fully-supervised upperbound
while using only 1% of the target annotations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional loop closure methods struggle in perceptually aliased environments like narrow pipes due to vector quantization, feature sparsity, and repetitive textures, while existing solutions have high computational costs.

Method: Introduces word groups to capture spatial co-occurrence of visual words for online dictionary construction, incorporates temporal consistency with adaptive scheme, and uses feature distribution analysis with post-verification mechanisms.

Result: BoWG surpasses state-of-the-art methods in precision-recall and computational efficiency, achieving 16 ms average processing time per image on Bicocca25b dataset with 17,565 images.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates excellent scalability and robustness in challenging environments, outperforming both traditional and learning-based approaches.

Abstract: Loop closure is critical in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
systems to reduce accumulative drift and ensure global mapping consistency.
However, conventional methods struggle in perceptually aliased environments,
such as narrow pipes, due to vector quantization, feature sparsity, and
repetitive textures, while existing solutions often incur high computational
costs. This paper presents Bag-of-Word-Groups (BoWG), a novel loop closure
detection method that achieves superior precision-recall, robustness, and
computational efficiency. The core innovation lies in the introduction of word
groups, which captures the spatial co-occurrence and proximity of visual words
to construct an online dictionary. Additionally, drawing inspiration from
probabilistic transition models, we incorporate temporal consistency directly
into similarity computation with an adaptive scheme, substantially improving
precision-recall performance. The method is further strengthened by a feature
distribution analysis module and dedicated post-verification mechanisms. To
evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on both public
datasets and a confined-pipe dataset we constructed. Results demonstrate that
BoWG surpasses state-of-the-art methods, including both traditional and
learning-based approaches, in terms of precision-recall and computational
efficiency. Our approach also exhibits excellent scalability, achieving an
average processing time of 16 ms per image across 17,565 images in the
Bicocca25b dataset.

TL;DR: UniPAN is a novel approach that enhances the generalizability of pansharpening models by normalizing pixel distributions from different satellite sources to a unified distribution, enabling "train once, deploy forever" capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning pansharpening models suffer from performance degradation on unseen satellite data due to distributional discrepancies from different sensors and imaging conditions, limiting their practical applicability.

Method: Proposes a unified distribution strategy (UniPAN) that constructs a distribution transformation function to normalize pixels from different sources to an identical distribution, allowing models to be trained and tested on consistent distributions.

Result: Extensive experiments validate UniPAN's efficacy in significantly enhancing pansharpening model performance across diverse satellite sensors, demonstrating improved generalizability.

Conclusion: UniPAN successfully bridges the gap between training and testing distributions, enabling deep pansharpening models to maintain performance across different satellite sensors and achieve practical deployment capabilities.

Abstract: Existing deep learning-based models for remote sensing pansharpening exhibit
exceptional performance on training datasets. However, due to sensor-specific
characteristics and varying imaging conditions, these models suffer from
substantial performance degradation when applied to unseen satellite data,
lacking generalizability and thus limiting their applicability. We argue that
the performance drops stem primarily from distributional discrepancies from
different sources and the key to addressing this challenge lies in bridging the
gap between training and testing distributions. To validate the idea and
further achieve a "train once, deploy forever" capability, this paper
introduces a novel and intuitive approach to enpower any pansharpening models
with generalizability by employing a unified distribution strategy (UniPAN).
Specifically, we construct a distribution transformation function that
normalizes the pixels sampled from different sources to conform to an identical
distribution. The deep models are trained on the transformed domain, and during
testing on new datasets, the new data are also transformed to match the
training distribution. UniPAN aims to train and test the model on a unified and
consistent distribution, thereby enhancing its generalizability. Extensive
experiments validate the efficacy of UniPAN, demonstrating its potential to
significantly enhance the performance of deep pansharpening models across
diverse satellite sensors. Codes: https://github.com/yc-cui/UniPAN.

TL;DR: Proposes a two-stage active learning pipeline for semantic segmentation that uses diffusion model features and combines diversity-based selection with uncertainty-based refinement to achieve high accuracy with minimal labeled pixels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation requires dense pixel-level annotations which are expensive, especially under extremely constrained labeling budgets. There's a need for efficient active learning methods that can work with very limited labeled data.

Method: Two-stage selection pipeline: 1) Hierarchical representation-based candidate selection using MaxHerding to choose representative pixels per image and create diverse global pool; 2) Entropy-augmented disagreement score (eDALD) over multi-scale diffusion features to select most informative pixels, decoupling diversity and uncertainty.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmarks (CamVid, ADE-Bed, Cityscapes, Pascal-Context) show the method significantly outperforms existing baselines under extreme pixel-budget regimes.

Conclusion: The proposed two-stage approach effectively addresses low-budget active learning for semantic segmentation by leveraging diffusion model features and separating diversity and uncertainty considerations, achieving high accuracy with minimal labeled pixels.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation demands dense pixel-level annotations, which can be
prohibitively expensive - especially under extremely constrained labeling
budgets. In this paper, we address the problem of low-budget active learning
for semantic segmentation by proposing a novel two-stage selection pipeline.
Our approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model to extract rich
multi-scale features that capture both global structure and fine details. In
the first stage, we perform a hierarchical, representation-based candidate
selection by first choosing a small subset of representative pixels per image
using MaxHerding, and then refining these into a diverse global pool. In the
second stage, we compute an entropy-augmented disagreement score (eDALD) over
noisy multi-scale diffusion features to capture both epistemic uncertainty and
prediction confidence, selecting the most informative pixels for annotation.
This decoupling of diversity and uncertainty lets us achieve high segmentation
accuracy with only a tiny fraction of labeled pixels. Extensive experiments on
four benchmarks (CamVid, ADE-Bed, Cityscapes, and Pascal-Context) demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines under extreme
pixel-budget regimes. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Endoscopic surgery presents unique challenges like photometric inconsistencies, non-rigid tissue motion, and view-dependent highlights that mislead traditional 3DGS methods relying solely on appearance constraints, leading to inaccurate reconstructions.

Method: Proposes a unified spatio-temporal Gaussian representation in 4D domain, optical flow-based geometric constraint for temporal coherence, and multi-resolution rational orthogonal wavelet supervision to separate endoscopic details and enhance rendering.

Result: Extensive evaluations on EndoNeRF and StereoMIS datasets show EndoWave achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and visual accuracy compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: EndoWave effectively addresses the limitations of existing 3DGS methods in endoscopic scenarios by incorporating geometric and wavelet constraints, enabling more accurate 3D reconstruction from surgical videos.

Abstract: In robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, accurate 3D reconstruction from
endoscopic video is vital for downstream tasks and improved outcomes. However,
endoscopic scenarios present unique challenges, including photometric
inconsistencies, non-rigid tissue motion, and view-dependent highlights. Most
3DGS-based methods that rely solely on appearance constraints for optimizing
3DGS are often insufficient in this context, as these dynamic visual artifacts
can mislead the optimization process and lead to inaccurate reconstructions. To
address these limitations, we present EndoWave, a unified spatio-temporal
Gaussian Splatting framework by incorporating an optical flow-based geometric
constraint and a multi-resolution rational wavelet supervision. First, we adopt
a unified spatio-temporal Gaussian representation that directly optimizes
primitives in a 4D domain. Second, we propose a geometric constraint derived
from optical flow to enhance temporal coherence and effectively constrain the
3D structure of the scene. Third, we propose a multi-resolution rational
orthogonal wavelet as a constraint, which can effectively separate the details
of the endoscope and enhance the rendering performance. Extensive evaluations
on two real surgical datasets, EndoNeRF and StereoMIS, demonstrate that our
method EndoWave achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and visual
accuracy compared to the baseline method.

TL;DR: DiffusionLane is a novel diffusion-based model for lane detection that treats lane detection as a denoising diffusion process in lane parameter space, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address lane detection challenges by leveraging diffusion models' denoising capabilities and improving feature representation through hybrid decoding strategies.

Method: Adds Gaussian noise to ground truth lane parameters (starting point and angle), then progressively refines noisy lane anchors using a hybrid diffusion decoder combining global-level and local-level decoders, with an auxiliary head for encoder supervision.

Result: Achieves strong generalization and detection performance: 1%+ accuracy improvement on Carlane domain adaptation, 81.32% F1 on CULane, 96.89% accuracy on Tusimple, and 97.59% F1 on LLAMAS.

Conclusion: DiffusionLane demonstrates the effectiveness of diffusion models for lane detection, offering superior performance and generalization across multiple datasets compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel diffusion-based model for lane detection,
called DiffusionLane, which treats the lane detection task as a denoising
diffusion process in the parameter space of the lane. Firstly, we add the
Gaussian noise to the parameters (the starting point and the angle) of ground
truth lanes to obtain noisy lane anchors, and the model learns to refine the
noisy lane anchors in a progressive way to obtain the target lanes. Secondly,
we propose a hybrid decoding strategy to address the poor feature
representation of the encoder, resulting from the noisy lane anchors.
Specifically, we design a hybrid diffusion decoder to combine global-level and
local-level decoders for high-quality lane anchors. Then, to improve the
feature representation of the encoder, we employ an auxiliary head in the
training stage to adopt the learnable lane anchors for enriching the
supervision on the encoder. Experimental results on four benchmarks, Carlane,
Tusimple, CULane, and LLAMAS, show that DiffusionLane possesses a strong
generalization ability and promising detection performance compared to the
previous state-of-the-art methods. For example, DiffusionLane with ResNet18
surpasses the existing methods by at least 1\% accuracy on the domain
adaptation dataset Carlane. Besides, DiffusionLane with MobileNetV4 gets
81.32\% F1 score on CULane, 96.89\% accuracy on Tusimple with ResNet34, and
97.59\% F1 score on LLAMAS with ResNet101. Code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world LiDAR point cloud annotation is costly, and existing self-training UDA methods don't effectively utilize unlabeled data due to fixed confidence thresholds.

Method: Dynamic Pseudo-Label Filtering (DPLF) scheme, Prior-Guided Data Augmentation Pipeline (PG-DAP) to mitigate domain shift, and data mixing consistency loss for context-free representations.

Result: Achieves superior performance on two synthetic-to-real point cloud semantic segmentation tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed DPLF and PG-DAP modules are effective for improving real data utilization in point cloud UDA semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Annotating real-world LiDAR point clouds for use in intelligent autonomous

Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has been widely used to improve point

they either rely on predefined or fixed confidence thresholds, resulting in
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Pseudo-Label
Filtering (DPLF) scheme to enhance real data utilization in point cloud UDA
semantic segmentation. Additionally, we design a simple and efficient
Prior-Guided Data Augmentation Pipeline (PG-DAP) to mitigate domain shift
between synthetic and real-world point clouds. Finally, we utilize data mixing
consistency loss to push the model to learn context-free representations. We
implement and thoroughly evaluate our approach through extensive comparisons
with state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on two challenging synthetic-to-real
point cloud semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior performance. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the DPLF
and PG-DAP modules. We release the code of our method in this paper.

Conclusion: CGRA4ML framework provides a viable path for implementing advanced semantic segmentation networks on FPGA, offering better power efficiency than traditional GPU solutions while maintaining competitive accuracy for real-time applications.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation has emerged as a fundamental problem in computer
vision, gaining particular importance in real-time applications such as
autonomous driving. The main challenge is achieving high accuracy while
operating under computational and hardware constraints. In this research, we
present an FPGA-based implementation of real-time semantic segmentation
leveraging the lightweight LMIINet architecture and the Coarse-Grained
Reconfigurable Array for Machine Learning (CGRA4ML) hardware framework. The
model was trained using Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) with 8-bit precision
on the Cityscapes dataset, reducing memory footprint by a factor of four while
enabling efficient fixed-point computations. Necessary modifications were
applied to adapt the model to CGRA4ML constraints, including simplifying skip
connections, employing hardware-friendly operations such as depthwise-separable
and 1A-1 convolutions, and redesigning parts of the Flatten Transformer. Our
implementation achieves approximately 90% pixel accuracy and 45% mean
Intersection-over-Union (mIoU), operating in real-time at 20 frames per second
(FPS) with 50.1 ms latency on the ZCU104 FPGA board. The results demonstrate
the potential of CGRA4ML, with its flexibility in mapping modern layers and
off-chip memory utilization for skip connections, provides a path for
implementing advanced semantic segmentation networks on FPGA for real-time
applications to outperform traditional GPU solutions in terms of power
efficiency while maintaining competitive accuracy. The code for this project is

*Shuhong Zheng,Ashkan Mirzaei,Igor Gilitschenski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TIRE is a novel method for subject-driven 3D/4D generation that improves semantic identity preservation across viewpoints by tracking, inpainting, and resplatting modifications to initial 3D assets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D/4D generation methods often fail to preserve semantic identity across different viewpoints, and personalized subject-driven generation remains underexplored.

Method: TIRE takes initial 3D assets from existing generative models, uses video tracking to identify regions needing modification, applies subject-driven 2D inpainting to progressively fill identified regions, and resplats modified 2D multi-view observations back to 3D while maintaining consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments show TIRE significantly improves identity preservation in 3D/4D generation compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed TIRE method effectively addresses the identity preservation problem in subject-driven 3D/4D generation through its track-inpaint-resplat pipeline.

Abstract: Current 3D/4D generation methods are usually optimized for photorealism,
efficiency, and aesthetics. However, they often fail to preserve the semantic
identity of the subject across different viewpoints. Adapting generation
methods with one or few images of a specific subject (also known as
Personalization or Subject-driven generation) allows generating visual content
that align with the identity of the subject. However, personalized 3D/4D
generation is still largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce TIRE
(Track, Inpaint, REsplat), a novel method for subject-driven 3D/4D generation.
It takes an initial 3D asset produced by an existing 3D generative model as
input and uses video tracking to identify the regions that need to be modified.
Then, we adopt a subject-driven 2D inpainting model for progressively infilling
the identified regions. Finally, we resplat the modified 2D multi-view
observations back to 3D while still maintaining consistency. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves identity
preservation in 3D/4D generation compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our

### [85] [Accident Anticipation via Temporal Occurrence Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22260)
*Tianhao Zhao,Yiyang Zou,Zihao Mao,Peilun Xiao,Yulin Huang,Hongda Yang,Yuxuan Li,Qun Li,Guobin Wu,Yutian Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a new accident anticipation method that directly predicts accident scores at multiple future time steps instead of current-frame risk scoring, using precise accident timestamps for supervision and a Transformer-based architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use ambiguous binary supervision that labels all frames in accident videos as positive, ignoring the continuous nature of risk variation over time, which leads to unreliable learning and false alarms.

Method: Uses a snippet-level encoder to model spatial-temporal dynamics and a Transformer-based temporal decoder with dedicated temporal queries to predict accident scores for multiple future horizons simultaneously.

Result: Achieves superior performance in both recall and Time-to-Accident (TTA) under realistic false alarm rate (FAR) constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed paradigm shift from current-frame risk scoring to direct future accident score prediction provides more reliable learning and better practical performance for accident anticipation.

Abstract: Accident anticipation aims to predict potential collisions in an online
manner, enabling timely alerts to enhance road safety. Existing methods
typically predict frame-level risk scores as indicators of hazard. However,
these approaches rely on ambiguous binary supervision (labeling all frames in
accident videos as positive) despite the fact that risk varies continuously
over time, leading to unreliable learning and false alarms. To address this, we
propose a novel paradigm that shifts the prediction target from current-frame
risk scoring to directly estimating accident scores at multiple future time
steps (e.g., 0.1s-2.0s ahead), leveraging precisely annotated accident
timestamps as supervision. Our method employs a snippet-level encoder to
jointly model spatial and temporal dynamics, and a Transformer-based temporal
decoder that predicts accident scores for all future horizons simultaneously
using dedicated temporal queries. Furthermore, we introduce a refined
evaluation protocol that reports Time-to-Accident (TTA) and recall (evaluated
at multiple pre-accident intervals (0.5s, 1.0s, and 1.5s)) only when the false
alarm rate (FAR) remains within an acceptable range, ensuring practical
relevance. Experiments show that our method achieves superior performance in
both recall and TTA under realistic FAR constraints.

*Qiao Li,Jie Li,Yukang Zhang,Lei Tan,Jing Chen,Jiayi Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GSAlign is a novel network for aerial-ground person re-identification that addresses geometric distortion and semantic misalignment through learnable thin plate spline warping and dynamic alignment modules, achieving significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aerial-ground person re-identification faces extreme viewpoint discrepancies, occlusions, and domain gaps between UAV and ground camera imagery. Existing methods struggle with severe pose variations and spatial misalignment in cross-view matching.

Method: Proposes GSAlign with two key components: (1) Learnable Thin Plate Spline (LTPS) Module that adaptively warps pedestrian features using learned keypoints to compensate for geometric variations, and (2) Dynamic Alignment Module (DAM) that estimates visibility-aware representation masks to highlight visible body regions and handle occlusions.

Result: Achieves significant improvements of +18.8% in mAP and +16.8% in Rank-1 accuracy over previous state-of-the-art methods on the CARGO dataset across four matching protocols.

Conclusion: GSAlign effectively addresses geometric distortion and semantic misalignment in aerial-ground person re-identification through joint geometric and semantic alignment, demonstrating superior performance in handling extreme viewpoint changes and occlusions.

Abstract: Aerial-Ground person re-identification (AG-ReID) is an emerging yet
challenging task that aims to match pedestrian images captured from drastically
different viewpoints, typically from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and
ground-based surveillance cameras. The task poses significant challenges due to
extreme viewpoint discrepancies, occlusions, and domain gaps between aerial and
ground imagery. While prior works have made progress by learning cross-view
representations, they remain limited in handling severe pose variations and
spatial misalignment. To address these issues, we propose a Geometric and
Semantic Alignment Network (GSAlign) tailored for AG-ReID. GSAlign introduces
two key components to jointly tackle geometric distortion and semantic
misalignment in aerial-ground matching: a Learnable Thin Plate Spline (LTPS)
Module and a Dynamic Alignment Module (DAM). The LTPS module adaptively warps
pedestrian features based on a set of learned keypoints, effectively
compensating for geometric variations caused by extreme viewpoint changes. In
parallel, the DAM estimates visibility-aware representation masks that
highlight visible body regions at the semantic level, thereby alleviating the
negative impact of occlusions and partial observations in cross-view
correspondence. A comprehensive evaluation on CARGO with four matching
protocols demonstrates the effectiveness of GSAlign, achieving significant
improvements of +18.8\% in mAP and +16.8\% in Rank-1 accuracy over previous
state-of-the-art methods on the aerial-ground setting. The code is available

TL;DR: WAON is a large-scale Japanese image-text dataset with 155M examples from Common Crawl, featuring filtering and deduplication. It outperforms ReLAION in Japanese cultural benchmarks when used to fine-tune SigLIP2 models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale, high-quality image-text datasets are crucial for developing effective Vision-Language Models, especially for Japanese language and cultural contexts where such resources are limited.

Method: Collected 155M Japanese image-text pairs from Common Crawl using filtering and deduplication techniques. Created WAON-Bench (374 classes) for evaluation. Fine-tuned SigLIP2 models on both WAON and ReLAION Japanese subsets.

Result: WAON-trained models achieved higher accuracy across all benchmarks and state-of-the-art performance on several Japanese cultural benchmarks, outperforming ReLAION-trained models.

Conclusion: WAON dataset effectively enhances Vision-Language Model performance for Japanese content, demonstrating superior results compared to existing datasets like ReLAION.

Abstract: Large-scale and high-quality image-text pair datasets play an important role
in developing high-performing Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we
introduce WAON, a large-scale and high-quality Japanese image-text pair dataset
containing approximately 155 million examples, collected from Common Crawl. Our
dataset construction pipeline employs various techniques, including filtering
and deduplication, which have been shown to be effective in previous studies.
To evaluate its effectiveness, we also construct WAON-Bench, a manually curated
benchmark for Japanese cultural image classification, consisting of 374

using both WAON and the Japanese subset of ReLAION, one of the most widely used
vision-language datasets. We fine-tune SigLIP2, a strong multilingual model, on
both datasets. The results demonstrate that WAON enhances model performance on
WAON-Bench more efficiently than ReLAION and achieves higher accuracy across
all evaluated benchmarks. Furthermore, the model fine-tuned on WAON achieves

TL;DR: CityRiSE is a reinforcement learning framework that improves Large Vision-Language Models' ability to reason about urban socio-economic status from visual data, achieving better accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs struggle with accurate and interpretable socio-economic predictions from visual data like street view and satellite imagery, which is crucial for sustainable development goals.

Method: Uses pure reinforcement learning with carefully curated multi-modal data and verifiable reward design to guide LVLMs to focus on semantically meaningful visual cues for structured reasoning.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing baselines, improving prediction accuracy and generalization across diverse urban contexts, especially for unseen cities and indicators.

Conclusion: Combining RL and LVLMs shows promise for interpretable and generalist urban socio-economic sensing.

Abstract: Harnessing publicly available, large-scale web data, such as street view and
satellite imagery, urban socio-economic sensing is of paramount importance for
achieving global sustainable development goals. With the emergence of Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), new opportunities have arisen to solve this
task by treating it as a multi-modal perception and understanding problem.
However, recent studies reveal that LVLMs still struggle with accurate and
interpretable socio-economic predictions from visual data. To address these
limitations and maximize the potential of LVLMs, we introduce
\textbf{CityRiSE}, a novel framework for \textbf{R}eason\textbf{i}ng urban
\textbf{S}ocio-\textbf{E}conomic status in LVLMs through pure reinforcement
learning (RL). With carefully curated multi-modal data and verifiable reward
design, our approach guides the LVLM to focus on semantically meaningful visual
cues, enabling structured and goal-oriented reasoning for generalist
socio-economic status prediction. Experiments demonstrate that CityRiSE with
emergent reasoning process significantly outperforms existing baselines,
improving both prediction accuracy and generalization across diverse urban
contexts, particularly for prediction on unseen cities and unseen indicators.
This work highlights the promise of combining RL and LVLMs for interpretable

*Jing Wang,Jiajun Liang,Jie Liu,Henglin Liu,Gongye Liu,Jun Zheng,Wanyuan Pang,Ao Ma,Zhenyu Xie,Xintao Wang,Meng Wang,Pengfei Wan,Xiaodan Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRPO-Guard addresses systematic shifts in importance-ratio distributions in GRPO-based reinforcement learning for flow-matching models, preventing implicit over-optimization through ratio normalization and gradient reweighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GRPO frameworks suffer from systematic shifts in importance-ratio distributions (mean below 1, inconsistent variance across timesteps), which prevents proper constraint of overconfident positive updates, leading to implicit over-optimization where proxy rewards increase but essential metrics like image quality deteriorate.

Method: GRPO-Guard incorporates ratio normalization to restore balanced and step-consistent importance ratios, and gradient reweighting to equalize policy gradients over noise conditions, acting as a regulated clipping mechanism without heavy KL regularization.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple diffusion backbones (SD3.5M, Flux.1-dev) and diverse proxy tasks show GRPO-Guard significantly reduces over-optimization while maintaining or improving generation quality.

Conclusion: GRPO-Guard provides a simple yet effective enhancement to GRPO frameworks that stabilizes optimization and mitigates implicit over-optimization, making learned policies more practical for real-world use.

Abstract: Recently, GRPO-based reinforcement learning has shown remarkable progress in
optimizing flow-matching models, effectively improving their alignment with
task-specific rewards. Within these frameworks, the policy update relies on
importance-ratio clipping to constrain overconfident positive and negative
gradients. However, in practice, we observe a systematic shift in the
importance-ratio distribution-its mean falls below 1 and its variance differs
substantially across timesteps. This left-shifted and inconsistent distribution
prevents positive-advantage samples from entering the clipped region, causing
the mechanism to fail in constraining overconfident positive updates. As a
result, the policy model inevitably enters an implicit over-optimization
stage-while the proxy reward continues to increase, essential metrics such as
image quality and text-prompt alignment deteriorate sharply, ultimately making
the learned policy impractical for real-world use. To address this issue, we
introduce GRPO-Guard, a simple yet effective enhancement to existing GRPO
frameworks. Our method incorporates ratio normalization, which restores a
balanced and step-consistent importance ratio, ensuring that PPO clipping
properly constrains harmful updates across denoising timesteps. In addition, a
gradient reweighting strategy equalizes policy gradients over noise conditions,
preventing excessive updates from particular timestep regions. Together, these
designs act as a regulated clipping mechanism, stabilizing optimization and
substantially mitigating implicit over-optimization without relying on heavy KL
regularization. Extensive experiments on multiple diffusion backbones (e.g.,
SD3.5M, Flux.1-dev) and diverse proxy tasks demonstrate that GRPO-Guard
significantly reduces over-optimization while maintaining or even improving
generation quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel self-supervised learning method that integrates graph theory to capture both intra-instance variations and inter-instance relationships using KNN graphs and GNNs, achieving significant accuracy improvements on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional self-supervised learning methods focus mainly on intra-instance variations from augmentations but overlook important inter-instance relationships, limiting their representation learning capabilities.

Method: Constructs k-nearest neighbor graphs for teacher and student streams during pretraining, with nodes as samples and edges encoding similarity. Uses Graph Neural Networks for representation refinement through multi-hop message propagation.

Result: Achieved accuracy improvements of 7.3% on CIFAR-10, 3.2% on ImageNet-100, and 1.0% on ImageNet-1K compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The graph-based mechanism effectively captures both intra-instance and inter-instance relationships, demonstrating superior performance in self-supervised representation learning.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates graph theory into
self-supervised representation learning. Traditional methods focus on
intra-instance variations generated by applying augmentations. However, they
often overlook important inter-instance relationships. While our method retains
the intra-instance property, it further captures inter-instance relationships
by constructing k-nearest neighbor (KNN) graphs for both teacher and student
streams during pretraining. In these graphs, nodes represent samples along with
their latent representations. Edges encode the similarity between instances.
Following pretraining, a representation refinement phase is performed. In this
phase, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate messages not only among immediate
neighbors but also across multiple hops, thereby enabling broader contextual
integration. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K
demonstrate accuracy improvements of 7.3%, 3.2%, and 1.0%, respectively, over
state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of the
proposed graph based mechanism. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: MindHier is a coarse-to-fine fMRI-to-image reconstruction framework that uses hierarchical neural embeddings and scale-aware guidance for more efficient and cognitively-aligned image generation compared to diffusion-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based methods map fMRI to single embeddings, collapsing hierarchical neural information and misaligning with stage-dependent reconstruction demands. The authors aim to create a more biologically plausible approach that mimics human visual perception.

Method: Three key components: 1) Hierarchical fMRI Encoder for multi-level neural embeddings, 2) Hierarchy-to-Hierarchy Alignment with CLIP features, 3) Scale-Aware Coarse-to-Fine Neural Guidance that injects embeddings into autoregression at matching scales.

Result: MindHier achieves superior semantic fidelity, 4.67x faster inference, and more deterministic results than diffusion-based baselines on the NSD dataset.

Conclusion: MindHier provides an efficient and cognitively-aligned alternative to diffusion methods by enabling hierarchical reconstruction that synthesizes global semantics before refining local details, similar to human visual perception.

Abstract: Reconstructing visual stimuli from fMRI signals is a central challenge
bridging machine learning and neuroscience. Recent diffusion-based methods
typically map fMRI activity to a single high-level embedding, using it as fixed
guidance throughout the entire generation process. However, this fixed guidance
collapses hierarchical neural information and is misaligned with the
stage-dependent demands of image reconstruction. In response, we propose
MindHier, a coarse-to-fine fMRI-to-image reconstruction framework built on
scale-wise autoregressive modeling. MindHier introduces three components: a
Hierarchical fMRI Encoder to extract multi-level neural embeddings, a
Hierarchy-to-Hierarchy Alignment scheme to enforce layer-wise correspondence
with CLIP features, and a Scale-Aware Coarse-to-Fine Neural Guidance strategy
to inject these embeddings into autoregression at matching scales. These
designs make MindHier an efficient and cognitively-aligned alternative to
diffusion-based methods by enabling a hierarchical reconstruction process that
synthesizes global semantics before refining local details, akin to human
visual perception. Extensive experiments on the NSD dataset show that MindHier
achieves superior semantic fidelity, 4.67x faster inference, and more
deterministic results than the diffusion-based baselines.

Motivation: Traditional 3D editing is time-consuming and requires specialized skills, while current image-based generative methods lack accuracy in geometric conditioning, making precise control of 3D object features challenging.

Method: Uses class-specific 3D objects as geometric priors to define keypoints and parametric correlations, ensures viewpoint consistency through rendered reference images, applies style transfer for appearance, and employs GeoDrag for improved drag-based editing accuracy and speed.

Result: Enables precise geometric modifications across various iterative design workflows and improves performance on geometry guidance tasks and general instructions on DragBench.

Conclusion: GeoDiffusion provides an effective solution for accurate and efficient geometric conditioning in image generation, addressing limitations of both traditional 3D editing and current generative methods.

Abstract: Precise geometric control in image generation is essential for engineering \&
product design and creative industries to control 3D object features accurately
in image space. Traditional 3D editing approaches are time-consuming and demand
specialized skills, while current image-based generative methods lack accuracy
in geometric conditioning. To address these challenges, we propose
GeoDiffusion, a training-free framework for accurate and efficient geometric

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate intrinsic parameter estimation is critical for endoscopic 3D reconstruction but is hindered by sterility constraints and specialized endoscopes with continuous zoom/rotation. Most existing methods don't estimate intrinsics, limiting reconstruction accuracy.

Method: Integrate intrinsic parameter estimation into self-supervised monocular depth estimation by adapting Depth Anything V2 model for joint depth, pose, and intrinsics prediction. Use attention-based pose network and Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) for efficient fine-tuning.

Result: Validated on SCARED and C3VD datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to recent state-of-the-art approaches in self-supervised monocular depth estimation and 3D reconstruction.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the challenge of intrinsic parameter estimation in endoscopic surgery scenes, enabling more accurate and reliable 3D reconstruction for enhanced surgical perception and decision-making.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of endoscopic surgery scenes plays a vital role in
enhancing scene perception, enabling AR visualization, and supporting
context-aware decision-making in image-guided surgery. A critical yet
challenging step in this process is the accurate estimation of the endoscope's
intrinsic parameters. In real surgical settings, intrinsic calibration is
hindered by sterility constraints and the use of specialized endoscopes with
continuous zoom and telescope rotation. Most existing methods for endoscopic 3D
reconstruction do not estimate intrinsic parameters, limiting their
effectiveness for accurate and reliable reconstruction. In this paper, we
integrate intrinsic parameter estimation into a self-supervised monocular depth
estimation framework by adapting the Depth Anything V2 (DA2) model for joint
depth, pose, and intrinsics prediction. We introduce an attention-based pose
network and a Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) strategy for
efficient fine-tuning of DA2. Our method is validated on the SCARED and C3VD
public datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to recent

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T2SMark is a two-stage watermarking scheme for diffusion models that uses Tail-Truncated Sampling to embed watermarks in reliable tail regions while preserving generation diversity through random sampling of central zones and session key integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Noise-as-Watermark methods for diffusion models struggle to balance watermark robustness with generation diversity - some methods achieve strong robustness by heavily constraining initial noise sampling (degrading user experience), while others preserve diversity but are too fragile for real-world deployment.

Method: Proposed T2SMark uses Tail-Truncated Sampling (TTS) that embeds watermark bits exclusively in reliable tail regions while randomly sampling the central zone to preserve latent distribution. A two-stage framework integrates randomly generated session keys into encryption pipelines to ensure sampling diversity.

Result: Extensive experiments on diffusion models with both U-Net and DiT backbones show that T2SMark achieves an optimal balance between robustness and diversity compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: T2SMark successfully addresses the trade-off between watermark robustness and generation diversity in diffusion models through its innovative Tail-Truncated Sampling approach and two-stage framework with session key integration.

Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced rapidly in recent years, producing
high-fidelity images while raising concerns about intellectual property
protection and the misuse of generative AI. Image watermarking for diffusion
models, particularly Noise-as-Watermark (NaW) methods, encode watermark as
specific standard Gaussian noise vector for image generation, embedding the
infomation seamlessly while maintaining image quality. For detection, the
generation process is inverted to recover the initial noise vector containing
the watermark before extraction. However, existing NaW methods struggle to
balance watermark robustness with generation diversity. Some methods achieve
strong robustness by heavily constraining initial noise sampling, which
degrades user experience, while others preserve diversity but prove too fragile
for real-world deployment. To address this issue, we propose T2SMark, a
two-stage watermarking scheme based on Tail-Truncated Sampling (TTS). Unlike
prior methods that simply map bits to positive or negative values, TTS enhances
robustness by embedding bits exclusively in the reliable tail regions while
randomly sampling the central zone to preserve the latent distribution. Our
two-stage framework then ensures sampling diversity by integrating a randomly
generated session key into both encryption pipelines. We evaluate T2SMark on
diffusion models with both U-Net and DiT backbones. Extensive experiments show
that it achieves an optimal balance between robustness and diversity. Our code

*Tianran Li,Marius Staring,Yuchuan Qiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a Recurrent Correlation-based framework for deformable image registration that dynamically relocates matching regions to efficiently handle large deformations while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for deformable image registration struggle with large deformations. Voxel-to-region matching is efficient but limited by locality, while region-to-region matching has high redundancy. There's a need for efficient long-range correspondence modeling.

Method: Uses a recurrent framework that performs local matching at each step, then uses estimated offsets to guide the next search region. Features a lightweight recurrent update module with memory capacity and decouples motion/texture features to reduce semantic redundancy.

Result: Achieves strong accuracy-computation trade-off, surpassing or matching state-of-the-art performance. On non-affine OASIS dataset, achieves comparable performance using only 9.5% of FLOPs and running 96% faster than RDP method.

Conclusion: The proposed recurrent correlation framework efficiently handles large deformations in medical image registration by dynamically relocating matching regions, providing superior computational efficiency while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: Deformable image registration estimates voxel-wise correspondences between
images through spatial transformations, and plays a key role in medical
imaging. While deep learning methods have significantly reduced runtime,
efficiently handling large deformations remains a challenging task.
Convolutional networks aggregate local features but lack direct modeling of
voxel correspondences, promoting recent works to explore explicit feature
matching. Among them, voxel-to-region matching is more efficient for direct
correspondence modeling by computing local correlation features whithin
neighbourhoods, while region-to-region matching incurs higher redundancy due to
excessive correlation pairs across large regions. However, the inherent
locality of voxel-to-region matching hinders the capture of long-range
correspondences required for large deformations. To address this, we propose a
Recurrent Correlation-based framework that dynamically relocates the matching
region toward more promising positions. At each step, local matching is
performed with low cost, and the estimated offset guides the next search
region, supporting efficient convergence toward large deformations. In
addition, we uses a lightweight recurrent update module with memory capacity
and decouples motion-related and texture features to suppress semantic
redundancy. We conduct extensive experiments on brain MRI and abdominal CT
datasets under two settings: with and without affine pre-registration. Results
show that our method exibits a strong accuracy-computation trade-off,
surpassing or matching the state-of-the-art performance. For example, it
achieves comparable performance on the non-affine OASIS dataset, while using
only 9.5% of the FLOPs and running 96% faster than RDP, a representative
high-performing method.

Abstract: We present a fully interpretable and flexible statistical method for
background subtraction in roadside LiDAR data, aimed at enhancing
infrastructure-based perception in automated driving. Our approach introduces
both a Gaussian distribution grid (GDG), which models the spatial statistics of
the background using background-only scans, and a filtering algorithm that uses
this representation to classify LiDAR points as foreground or background. The
method supports diverse LiDAR types, including multiline 360 degree and
micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) sensors, and adapts to various
configurations. Evaluated on the publicly available RCooper dataset, it
outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in accuracy and flexibility, even with
minimal background data. Its efficient implementation ensures reliable
performance on low-resource hardware, enabling scalable real-world deployment.

*Jusheng Zhang,Kaitong Cai,Jing Yang,Jian Wang,Chengpei Tang,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TDSR redefines image captioning as a hierarchical refinement planning problem using MCTS to enhance VLMs' narrative coherence while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with maintaining global narrative coherence while capturing rich details in multi-step scene descriptions due to myopic single-step generation.

Method: Proposes TDSR framework modeling generation as MDP with efficient MCTS using visual-guided parallel expansion, lightweight value network, and adaptive early stopping.

Result: Reduces VLM calls by 10x while achieving SOTA results on DetailCaps, COMPOSITIONCAP, and POPE benchmarks for fine-grained description, compositional generalization, and hallucination suppression.

Conclusion: TDSR effectively addresses VLMs' coherence-detail tradeoff through hierarchical planning, significantly improving performance as a plug-and-play module.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face an inherent contradiction in image
captioning: their powerful single-step generation capabilities often lead to a
myopic decision-making process. This makes it difficult to maintain global
narrative coherence while capturing rich details, a limitation that is
particularly pronounced in tasks that require multi-step and complex scene
description. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we redefine image
captioning as a goal-oriented hierarchical refinement planning problem, and
further propose a novel framework, named Top-Down Semantic Refinement (TDSR),
which models the generation process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
However, planning within the vast state space of a VLM presents a significant
computational hurdle. Our core contribution, therefore, is the design of a
highly efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm tailored for VLMs. By
incorporating a visual-guided parallel expansion and a lightweight value
network, our TDSR reduces the call frequency to the expensive VLM by an order
of magnitude without sacrificing planning quality. Furthermore, an adaptive
early stopping mechanism dynamically matches computational overhead to the
image's complexity. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including
DetailCaps, COMPOSITIONCAP, and POPE, demonstrate that our TDSR, as a
plug-and-play module, can significantly enhance the performance of existing
VLMs (e.g., LLaVA-1.5, Qwen2.5-VL) by achieving state-of-the-art or highly
competitive results in fine-grained description, compositional generalization,
and hallucination suppression.

*Ghazal Farhani,Taufiq Rahman,Syed Mostaquim Ali,Andrew Liu,Mohamed Zaki,Dominique Charlebois,Benoit Anctil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes LiDAR performance degradation in snowy conditions, develops a physics-based model to simulate signal attenuation, and evaluates its impact on object detection models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR sensors perform well in clear weather but deteriorate significantly in adverse conditions like snowfall, which can render autonomous driving perception systems ineffective. The extent of signal degradation under various weather conditions remains largely unquantified.

Method: Developed a physics-based model to examine LiDAR failure modes in snowy conditions, investigating signal attenuation with different snowfall rates and how snow particles act as reflectors. Used the model to transform clear weather data into synthetic snowy scenarios.

Result: Successfully created synthetic data representing different snowfall rates and compared it with actual snowy conditions. Used this synthetic data to assess the performance impact on pre-trained object detection models under varying snowfall levels.

Conclusion: The study provides a framework for quantifying LiDAR signal degradation in snowy conditions and demonstrates how synthetic data can be used to evaluate and potentially improve object detection model performance in adverse weather.

Abstract: Because 3D structure of a roadway environment can be characterized directly
by a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors, they can be used to obtain
exceptional situational awareness for assitive and autonomous driving systems.
Although LiDARs demonstrate good performance in clean and clear weather
conditions, their performance significantly deteriorates in adverse weather
conditions such as those involving atmospheric precipitation. This may render
perception capabilities of autonomous systems that use LiDAR data in learning
based models to perform object detection and ranging ineffective. While efforts
have been made to enhance the accuracy of these models, the extent of signal
degradation under various weather conditions remains largely not quantified. In
this study, we focus on the performance of an automotive grade LiDAR in snowy
conditions in order to develop a physics-based model that examines failure
modes of a LiDAR sensor. Specifically, we investigated how the LiDAR signal
attenuates with different snowfall rates and how snow particles near the source
serve as small but efficient reflectors. Utilizing our model, we transform data
from clear conditions to simulate snowy scenarios, enabling a comparison of our
synthetic data with actual snowy conditions. Furthermore, we employ this
synthetic data, representative of different snowfall rates, to explore the
impact on a pre-trained object detection model, assessing its performance under
varying levels of snowfall

TL;DR: WAGIBench is a new benchmark for evaluating goal inference in assistive wearable agents using vision-language models, based on a novel dataset of 29 hours of multimodal data from 348 participants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable proactive assistance from wearable agents by automatically inferring user goals from multimodal contextual observations, eliminating the need for explicit user queries.

Method: Created WAGIBench benchmark using a novel dataset with 3,477 recordings featuring ground-truth goals and multimodal observations (visual, audio, digital, longitudinal). Evaluated several families of vision-language models on this benchmark.

Result: Human performance (93% accuracy) significantly exceeds best VLM performance (84%). Larger VLMs perform better but remain far from practical usefulness, producing relevant goals only 55% of the time. Models benefit from relevant modalities with minimal degradation from irrelevant ones.

Conclusion: Current vision-language models show promise for goal inference but remain far from human-level performance and practical deployment, highlighting the need for continued research in this area.

Abstract: There has been a surge of interest in assistive wearable agents: agents
embodied in wearable form factors (e.g., smart glasses) who take assistive
actions toward a user's goal/query (e.g. "Where did I leave my keys?"). In this
work, we consider the important complementary problem of inferring that goal
from multi-modal contextual observations. Solving this "goal inference" problem
holds the promise of eliminating the effort needed to interact with such an
agent. This work focuses on creating WAGIBench, a strong benchmark to measure
progress in solving this problem using vision-language models (VLMs). Given the
limited prior work in this area, we collected a novel dataset comprising 29
hours of multimodal data from 348 participants across 3,477 recordings,
featuring ground-truth goals alongside accompanying visual, audio, digital, and
longitudinal contextual observations. We validate that human performance
exceeds model performance, achieving 93% multiple-choice accuracy compared with
84% for the best-performing VLM. Generative benchmark results that evaluate
several families of modern vision-language models show that larger models
perform significantly better on the task, yet remain far from practical
usefulness, as they produce relevant goals only 55% of the time. Through a
modality ablation, we show that models benefit from extra information in
relevant modalities with minimal performance degradation from irrelevant
modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Particle picking in CryoET is a major bottleneck due to reliance on manual labels, leaving vast unlabeled tomograms underutilized.

Method: End-to-end heatmap-supervised detection model inspired by keypoint detection, teacher-student co-training, multi-view pseudo-labeling, and CryoET-specific DropBlock augmentation.

Result: Improves F1 score by 10% over supervised baselines on the CZII dataset.

Conclusion: Semi-supervised learning shows promise for leveraging unlabeled CryoET data to overcome labeling bottlenecks.

Abstract: Cryogenic Electron Tomography (CryoET) combined with sub-volume averaging
(SVA) is the only imaging modality capable of resolving protein structures
inside cells at molecular resolution. Particle picking, the task of localizing
and classifying target proteins in 3D CryoET volumes, remains the main
bottleneck. Due to the reliance on time-consuming manual labels, the vast
reserve of unlabeled tomograms remains underutilized. In this work, we present
a fast, label-efficient semi-supervised framework that exploits this untapped
data. Our framework consists of two components: (i) an end-to-end
heatmap-supervised detection model inspired by keypoint detection, and (ii) a
teacher-student co-training mechanism that enhances performance under sparse
labeling conditions. Furthermore, we introduce multi-view pseudo-labeling and a
CryoET-specific DropBlock augmentation strategy to further boost performance.
Extensive evaluations on the large-scale CZII dataset show that our approach
improves F1 by 10% over supervised baselines, underscoring the promise of
semi-supervised learning for leveraging unlabeled CryoET data.

Motivation: Generating high-quality 4D dynamic content from single static images remains challenging due to limitations in modeling temporal dependencies and capturing dynamic geometry changes, especially with camera perspective variations.

Method: Integrates 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) with Category-Agnostic Pose Estimation (CAPE) technology. Uses 3D Gaussian Splatting to construct 3D models from single images, then predicts multi-view pose keypoints based on one-shot support from a chosen view with supervisory signals for motion consistency.

Conclusion: DynaPose4D framework shows promising potential for applications in computer vision and animation production, successfully addressing the challenge of 4D dynamic content generation from static images.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 2D and 3D generative models have expanded the
capabilities of computer vision. However, generating high-quality 4D dynamic
content from a single static image remains a significant challenge. Traditional
methods have limitations in modeling temporal dependencies and accurately
capturing dynamic geometry changes, especially when considering variations in

solution that integrates 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) techniques with
Category-Agnostic Pose Estimation (CAPE) technology. This framework uses 3D
Gaussian Splatting to construct a 3D model from single images, then predicts
multi-view pose keypoints based on one-shot support from a chosen view,
leveraging supervisory signals to enhance motion consistency. Experimental
results show that DynaPose4D achieves excellent coherence, consistency, and
fluidity in dynamic motion generation. These findings not only validate the
efficacy of the DynaPose4D framework but also indicate its potential
applications in the domains of computer vision and animation production.

### [102] [Single-Teacher View Augmentation: Boosting Knowledge Distillation via Angular Diversity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22480)
*Seonghoon Yu,Dongjun Nam,Dina Katabi,Jeany Son*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a cost-efficient knowledge distillation method that generates diverse multi-views from a single teacher using angular diversity objectives, outperforming existing knowledge augmentation approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current knowledge distillation methods require multiple teacher networks for diverse perspectives, leading to high computational costs. This work aims to achieve diversity efficiently using a single teacher.

Method: Attach multiple branches to a single teacher to generate diverse multi-views. Use two angular diversity objectives: constrained inter-angle diversify loss (maximizes angles between views while preserving proximity to teacher) and intra-angle diversify loss (encourages even distribution around teacher output).

Result: Experimental results show the method surpasses existing knowledge augmentation approaches across diverse configurations and provides consistent improvements when combined with other KD frameworks.

Conclusion: The proposed angular diversity objectives effectively increase ensemble diversity, reduce ensemble loss bounds, and enable cost-efficient knowledge distillation with plug-and-play compatibility.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) aims to train a lightweight student model by
transferring knowledge from a large, high-capacity teacher. Recent studies have
shown that leveraging diverse teacher perspectives can significantly improve
distillation performance; however, achieving such diversity typically requires
multiple teacher networks, leading to high computational costs. In this work,
we propose a novel cost-efficient knowledge augmentation method for KD that
generates diverse multi-views by attaching multiple branches to a single
teacher. To ensure meaningful semantic variation across multi-views, we
introduce two angular diversity objectives: 1) constrained inter-angle
diversify loss, which maximizes angles between augmented views while preserving
proximity to the original teacher output, and 2) intra-angle diversify loss,
which encourages an even distribution of views around the original output. The
ensembled knowledge from these angularly diverse views, along with the original
teacher, is distilled into the student. We further theoretically demonstrate
that our objectives increase the diversity among ensemble members and thereby
reduce the upper bound of the ensemble's expected loss, leading to more
effective distillation. Experimental results show that our method surpasses an
existing knowledge augmentation method across diverse configurations. Moreover,
the proposed method is compatible with other KD frameworks in a plug-and-play
fashion, providing consistent improvements in generalization performance.

Conclusion: The proposed GateFuseNet effectively integrates multimodal MRI data for improved PD diagnosis, demonstrating superior performance through adaptive feature fusion and clinically meaningful attention to pathological regions.

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) from MRI remains challenging
due to symptom variability and pathological heterogeneity. Most existing
methods rely on conventional magnitude-based MRI modalities, such as
T1-weighted images (T1w), which are less sensitive to PD pathology than
Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM), a phase-based MRI technique that
quantifies iron deposition in deep gray matter nuclei. In this study, we
propose GateFuseNet, an adaptive 3D multimodal fusion network that integrates
QSM and T1w images for PD diagnosis. The core innovation lies in a gated fusion
module that learns modality-specific attention weights and channel-wise gating
vectors for selective feature modulation. This hierarchical gating mechanism
enhances ROI-aware features while suppressing irrelevant signals. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms three existing state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving 85.00% accuracy and 92.06% AUC. Ablation studies further
validate the contributions of ROI guidance, multimodal integration, and fusion
positioning. Grad-CAM visualizations confirm the model's focus on clinically
relevant pathological regions. The source codes and pretrained models can be

TL;DR: ORIG is an agentic open multimodal retrieval-augmented framework that improves factual image generation by iteratively retrieving and filtering web evidence to create enriched prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LMMs produce images that contradict verifiable knowledge, especially for fine-grained attributes or time-sensitive events, due to reliance on static sources and shallow evidence integration.

Method: ORIG iteratively retrieves and filters multimodal evidence from the web, then incrementally integrates refined knowledge into enriched prompts to guide generation.

Result: ORIG substantially improves factual consistency and overall image quality over strong baselines, demonstrating the potential of open multimodal retrieval for factual image generation.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the gap between visual realism and factual grounding in image generation through open multimodal retrieval augmentation.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
generating photorealistic and prompt-aligned images, but they often produce
outputs that contradict verifiable knowledge, especially when prompts involve
fine-grained attributes or time-sensitive events. Conventional
retrieval-augmented approaches attempt to address this issue by introducing
external information, yet they are fundamentally incapable of grounding
generation in accurate and evolving knowledge due to their reliance on static
sources and shallow evidence integration. To bridge this gap, we introduce
ORIG, an agentic open multimodal retrieval-augmented framework for Factual
Image Generation (FIG), a new task that requires both visual realism and
factual grounding. ORIG iteratively retrieves and filters multimodal evidence
from the web and incrementally integrates the refined knowledge into enriched
prompts to guide generation. To support systematic evaluation, we build
FIG-Eval, a benchmark spanning ten categories across perceptual, compositional,
and temporal dimensions. Experiments demonstrate that ORIG substantially
improves factual consistency and overall image quality over strong baselines,
highlighting the potential of open multimodal retrieval for factual image
generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hybrid image cropping methods lack explicit photographic composition guidance, which is crucial for visual appeal in applications like view recommendation and thumbnail generation.

Method: AesCrop integrates VMamba image encoder with novel Mamba Composition Attention Bias (MCAB) and transformer decoder for end-to-end rank-based image cropping, explicitly encoding compositional cues into attention mechanism.

Result: Extensive experiments show AesCrop outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior quantitative metrics and producing qualitatively more pleasing crops.

Conclusion: The proposed AesCrop model successfully bridges the gap between evaluation-based and regression-based approaches by incorporating explicit compositional guidance, delivering better diversity and globality in image cropping.

Abstract: Aesthetic-driven image cropping is crucial for applications like view
recommendation and thumbnail generation, where visual appeal significantly
impacts user engagement. A key factor in visual appeal is composition--the
deliberate arrangement of elements within an image. Some methods have
successfully incorporated compositional knowledge through evaluation-based and
regression-based paradigms. However, evaluation-based methods lack globality
while regression-based methods lack diversity. Recently, hybrid approaches that
integrate both paradigms have emerged, bridging the gap between these two to
achieve better diversity and globality. Notably, existing hybrid methods do not
incorporate photographic composition guidance, a key attribute that defines
photographic aesthetics. In this work, we introduce AesCrop, a
composition-aware hybrid image-cropping model that integrates a VMamba image
encoder, augmented with a novel Mamba Composition Attention Bias (MCAB) and a
transformer decoder to perform end-to-end rank-based image cropping, generating
multiple crops along with the corresponding quality scores. By explicitly
encoding compositional cues into the attention mechanism, MCAB directs AesCrop
to focus on the most compositionally salient regions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that AesCrop outperforms current state-of-the-art methods,
delivering superior quantitative metrics and qualitatively more pleasing crops.

TL;DR: Proposes SRSR framework with SRCA and STCFG to address semantic ambiguities in diffusion-based super-resolution by refining text conditioning and preventing hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address semantic ambiguities and hallucinations in diffusion-based super-resolution caused by inaccurate text conditioning and cross-attention diversion to irrelevant pixels.

Method: Two-component framework: 1) Spatially Re-focused Cross-Attention (SRCA) using segmentation masks to guide cross-attention, 2) Spatially Targeted Classifier-Free Guidance (STCFG) to selectively bypass text influences on ungrounded pixels.

Result: Outperforms 7 state-of-the-art baselines in PSNR and SSIM across all datasets, and in LPIPS and DISTS on real-world benchmarks, achieving high semantic fidelity and perceptual quality.

Conclusion: SRSR effectively addresses semantic misalignment and hallucinations in super-resolution through spatially-focused conditioning mechanisms.

Abstract: Existing diffusion-based super-resolution approaches often exhibit semantic
ambiguities due to inaccuracies and incompleteness in their text conditioning,
coupled with the inherent tendency for cross-attention to divert towards
irrelevant pixels. These limitations can lead to semantic misalignment and
hallucinated details in the generated high-resolution outputs. To address
these, we propose a novel, plug-and-play spatially re-focused super-resolution
(SRSR) framework that consists of two core components: first, we introduce
Spatially Re-focused Cross-Attention (SRCA), which refines text conditioning at
inference time by applying visually-grounded segmentation masks to guide
cross-attention. Second, we introduce a Spatially Targeted Classifier-Free
Guidance (STCFG) mechanism that selectively bypasses text influences on
ungrounded pixels to prevent hallucinations. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that SRSR consistently
outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines in standard fidelity metrics (PSNR
and SSIM) across all datasets, and in perceptual quality measures (LPIPS and
DISTS) on two real-world benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in
achieving both high semantic fidelity and perceptual quality in
super-resolution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STATUS Bench is the first benchmark for evaluating Vision-Language Models' ability to understand subtle object state variations through three simultaneous tasks: object state identification, image retrieval, and state change identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Vision-Language Models can perform various multimodal tasks, it's unclear how precisely they can identify subtle object states like positional states (open/closed) and functional states (on/off).

Method: Created STATUS Bench with hand-crafted image pairs and descriptions, requiring VLMs to perform three simultaneous tasks. Also introduced STATUS Train - a 13M semi-automatically created training dataset.

Result: Current state-of-the-art VLMs significantly struggle with subtle object state distinctions. Most open-weight VLMs showed chance-level zero-shot performance. After fine-tuning on STATUS Train, Qwen2.5-VL achieved performance comparable to Gemini 2.0 Flash.

Conclusion: STATUS Bench and Train are necessary for advancing object state recognition in VLM research, as current models still struggle with subtle state distinctions despite their general multimodal capabilities.

Abstract: Object state recognition aims to identify the specific condition of objects,
such as their positional states (e.g., open or closed) and functional states
(e.g., on or off). While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are capable of
performing a variety of multimodal tasks, it remains unclear how precisely they
can identify object states. To alleviate this issue, we introduce the STAte and
Transition UnderStanding Benchmark (STATUS Bench), the first benchmark for
rigorously evaluating the ability of VLMs to understand subtle variations in
object states in diverse situations. Specifically, STATUS Bench introduces a
novel evaluation scheme that requires VLMs to perform three tasks
simultaneously: object state identification (OSI), image retrieval (IR), and
state change identification (SCI). These tasks are defined over our fully
hand-crafted dataset involving image pairs, their corresponding object state
descriptions and state change descriptions. Furthermore, we introduce a
large-scale training dataset, namely STATUS Train, which consists of 13 million
semi-automatically created descriptions. This dataset serves as the largest
resource to facilitate further research in this area. In our experiments, we
demonstrate that STATUS Bench enables rigorous consistency evaluation and
reveal that current state-of-the-art VLMs still significantly struggle to
capture subtle object state distinctions. Surprisingly, under the proposed
rigorous evaluation scheme, most open-weight VLMs exhibited chance-level
zero-shot performance. After fine-tuning on STATUS Train, Qwen2.5-VL achieved
performance comparable to Gemini 2.0 Flash. These findings underscore the
necessity of STATUS Bench and Train for advancing object state recognition in
VLM research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing micro-expression analysis methods perform poorly in real-world scenarios because they rely on controlled laboratory datasets, creating a need for solutions that work in natural conversational settings.

Method: Proposed three contributions: 1) First micro-expression dataset for conversational-in-the-wild scenarios, 2) MELDAE end-to-end localization and detection framework, 3) Novel boundary-aware loss function that penalizes onset and offset errors to improve temporal accuracy.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results on WDMD dataset with 17.72% improvement in F1_DR localization metric over strongest baseline, while demonstrating excellent generalization capabilities on existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the challenge of micro-expression analysis in wild scenarios and significantly outperforms existing methods in both localization accuracy and generalization.

Abstract: Accurately analyzing spontaneous, unconscious micro-expressions is crucial
for revealing true human emotions, but this task remains challenging in wild
scenarios, such as natural conversation. Existing research largely relies on
datasets from controlled laboratory environments, and their performance
degrades dramatically in the real world. To address this issue, we propose
three contributions: the first micro-expression dataset focused on
conversational-in-the-wild scenarios; an end-to-end localization and detection
framework, MELDAE; and a novel boundary-aware loss function that improves
temporal accuracy by penalizing onset and offset errors. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on the WDMD
dataset, improving the key F1_{DR} localization metric by 17.72% over the
strongest baseline, while also demonstrating excellent generalization

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses core challenges in XLFM reconstruction through standardized benchmarking, self-supervised learning of angular priors, and physically-grounded rendering constraints.

Abstract: Light field microscopy (LFM) has become an emerging tool in neuroscience for
large-scale neural imaging in vivo, notable for its single-exposure volumetric
imaging, broad field of view, and high temporal resolution. However,
learning-based 3D reconstruction in XLFM remains underdeveloped due to two core
challenges: the absence of standardized datasets and the lack of methods that
can efficiently model its angular-spatial structure while remaining physically
grounded. We address these challenges by introducing three key contributions.
First, we construct the XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark, a large-scale dataset and
evaluation suite for XLFM reconstruction. Second, we propose Masked View
Modeling for Light Fields (MVN-LF), a self-supervised task that learns angular
priors by predicting occluded views, improving data efficiency. Third, we
formulate the Optical Rendering Consistency Loss (ORC Loss), a differentiable
rendering constraint that enforces alignment between predicted volumes and
their PSF-based forward projections. On the XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark, our
method improves PSNR by 7.7% over state-of-the-art baselines.

*Jian Sun,Kangdao Liu,Chi Zhang,Chuangquan Chen,Junge Shen,Chi-Man Vong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PFED is an efficient cross-view geo-localization framework for UAVs that combines hierarchical knowledge distillation and multi-view refinement to achieve high accuracy with significantly reduced computational costs, enabling real-time deployment on edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-view geo-localization methods rely on resource-intensive fine-grained feature extraction and alignment, which increases inference costs and limits deployment on edge devices for real-time UAV applications.

Method: PFED uses hierarchical knowledge transfer with Uncertainty-Aware Prediction Alignment during training, and an efficient Multi-view Refinement Module during inference that leverages mutual information to filter redundant samples and utilize multi-view data.

Result: PFED achieves 97.15% Recall@1 on University-1652 dataset while being 5x more efficient in FLOPs and 3x faster than previous methods. It runs at 251.5 FPS on AGX Orin edge device.

Conclusion: PFED demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and efficiency, making it practically viable for real-time UAV geo-localization applications in GNSS-denied environments.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) enables UAV localization by matching
aerial images to geo-tagged satellite databases, which is critical for
autonomous navigation in GNSS-denied environments. However, existing methods
rely on resource-intensive fine-grained feature extraction and alignment, where
multiple branches and modules significantly increase inference costs, limiting
their deployment on edge devices. We propose Precision-Focused Efficient Design
(PFED), a resource-efficient framework combining hierarchical knowledge
transfer and multi-view representation refinement. This innovative method
comprises two key components: 1) During training, Hierarchical Distillation
paradigm for fast and accurate CVGL (HD-CVGL), coupled with Uncertainty-Aware
Prediction Alignment (UAPA) to distill essential information and mitigate the
data imbalance without incurring additional inference overhead. 2) During
inference, an efficient Multi-view Refinement Module (MRM) leverages mutual
information to filter redundant samples and effectively utilize the multi-view
data. Extensive experiments show that PFED achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both accuracy and efficiency, reaching 97.15\% Recall@1 on
University-1652 while being over $5 \times$ more efficient in FLOPs and $3
\times$ faster than previous top methods. Furthermore, PFED runs at 251.5 FPS
on the AGX Orin edge device, demonstrating its practical viability for
real-time UAV applications. The project is available at

*Boyi Zheng,Yalin Zheng,Hrvoje Bogunović,Qing Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PSScreen V2 is a partially supervised self-training framework for multiple retinal disease screening that addresses label absence and domain shift challenges using a three-branch architecture with novel feature augmentation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of previous methods that rely on fully labelled or single-domain datasets, and to handle multiple partially labelled datasets with different distributions.

Method: Three-branch architecture with teacher and two student networks. Teacher generates pseudo labels from weakly augmented images. Students use Low-Frequency Dropout (LF-Dropout) for domain robustness and Low-Frequency Uncertainty (LF-Uncert) for estimating domain variability via adversarial learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior domain generalization on multiple in-domain and out-of-domain fundus datasets. Shows compatibility with diverse backbones including DINOv2 and generalizes to chest X-ray datasets.

Conclusion: PSScreen V2 provides an effective framework for partially supervised learning with strong domain generalization capabilities, demonstrating universality and adaptability across different medical imaging modalities.

Abstract: In this work, we propose PSScreen V2, a partially supervised self-training
framework for multiple retinal disease screening. Unlike previous methods that
rely on fully labelled or single-domain datasets, PSScreen V2 is designed to
learn from multiple partially labelled datasets with different distributions,
addressing both label absence and domain shift challenges. To this end,
PSScreen V2 adopts a three-branch architecture with one teacher and two student
networks. The teacher branch generates pseudo labels from weakly augmented
images to address missing labels, while the two student branches introduce
novel feature augmentation strategies: Low-Frequency Dropout (LF-Dropout),
which enhances domain robustness by randomly discarding domain-related
low-frequency components, and Low-Frequency Uncertainty (LF-Uncert), which
estimates uncertain domain variability via adversarially learned Gaussian
perturbations of low-frequency statistics. Extensive experiments on multiple
in-domain and out-of-domain fundus datasets demonstrate that PSScreen V2
achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior domain generalization
ability. Furthermore, compatibility tests with diverse backbones, including the
vision foundation model DINOv2, as well as evaluations on chest X-ray datasets,
highlight the universality and adaptability of the proposed framework. The

*Yuang Wang,Pengfei Jin,Siyeop Yoon,Matthew Tivnan,Shaoyang Zhang,Li Zhang,Quanzheng Li,Zhiqiang Chen,Dufan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PEDB is a novel diffusion bridge model that incorporates data consistency for CT reconstruction from incomplete projection data by embedding projection data into the reverse SDE score function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion bridge models for CT reconstruction don't adequately incorporate data consistency, which is crucial for improving reconstruction fidelity and detail recovery by aligning with observed projection data.

Method: Proposes Projection Embedded Diffusion Bridge (PEDB) with a novel reverse SDE that samples clean images conditioned on both FBP reconstruction and incomplete projection data. Includes a tractable posterior score derivation, stochasticity control parameter, and discretization scheme to reduce error.

Result: PEDB achieves strong performance in CT reconstruction from sparse-view, limited-angle, and truncated projections, outperforming state-of-the-art diffusion bridge models across standard, noisy, and domain-shift evaluations.

Conclusion: PEDB successfully incorporates data consistency into diffusion bridge models for CT reconstruction, demonstrating superior performance across various incomplete data scenarios and evaluation conditions.

Abstract: Reconstructing CT images from incomplete projection data remains challenging
due to the ill-posed nature of the problem. Diffusion bridge models have
recently shown promise in restoring clean images from their corresponding
Filtered Back Projection (FBP) reconstructions, but incorporating data
consistency into these models remains largely underexplored. Incorporating data
consistency can improve reconstruction fidelity by aligning the reconstructed
image with the observed projection data, and can enhance detail recovery by
integrating structural information contained in the projections. In this work,
we propose the Projection Embedded Diffusion Bridge (PEDB). PEDB introduces a
novel reverse stochastic differential equation (SDE) to sample from the
distribution of clean images conditioned on both the FBP reconstruction and the
incomplete projection data. By explicitly conditioning on the projection data
in sampling the clean images, PEDB naturally incorporates data consistency. We
embed the projection data into the score function of the reverse SDE. Under
certain assumptions, we derive a tractable expression for the posterior score.
In addition, we introduce a free parameter to control the level of
stochasticity in the reverse process. We also design a discretization scheme
for the reverse SDE to mitigate discretization error. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PEDB achieves strong performance in CT reconstruction from
three types of incomplete data, including sparse-view, limited-angle, and
truncated projections. For each of these types, PEDB outperforms evaluated
state-of-the-art diffusion bridge models across standard, noisy, and
domain-shift evaluations.

*Yassh Ramchandani,Vijayashekhar S S,Jignesh S. Bhatt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SWAN is a three-stage self-supervised wavelet neural network for hyperspectral unmixing that estimates endmembers and abundances without ground truth by leveraging wavelet transforms and physics-based learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a self-supervised method for hyperspectral unmixing that eliminates the need for ground truth data and exploits latent symmetries in wavelet-transformed hyperspectral imagery.

Method: Three-stage architecture: SWANencoder maps wavelet coefficients to latent space, SWANdecoder reconstructs coefficients, SWANforward learns hyperspectral physics. Uses Biorthogonal wavelet basis, Adam optimization, Sigmoid with dropout, and kernel regularizers.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real benchmark datasets show performance enhancement compared to state-of-the-art neural network methods, with improved unmixing function and compact parameters.

Conclusion: SWAN provides an effective self-supervised approach for hyperspectral unmixing that learns resilient unmixing functions while promoting practical applications through compact network design.

Abstract: In this article, we present SWAN: a three-stage, self-supervised wavelet
neural network for joint estimation of endmembers and abundances from
hyperspectral imagery. The contiguous and overlapping hyperspectral band images
are first expanded to Biorthogonal wavelet basis space that provides sparse,
distributed, and multi-scale representations. The idea is to exploit latent
symmetries from thus obtained invariant and covariant features using a
self-supervised learning paradigm. The first stage, SWANencoder maps the input
wavelet coefficients to a compact lower-dimensional latent space. The second
stage, SWANdecoder uses the derived latent representation to reconstruct the
input wavelet coefficients. Interestingly, the third stage SWANforward learns
the underlying physics of the hyperspectral image. A three-stage combined loss
function is formulated in the image acquisition domain that eliminates the need
for ground truth and enables self-supervised training. Adam is employed for
optimizing the proposed loss function, while Sigmoid with a dropout of 0.3 is
incorporated to avoid possible overfitting. Kernel regularizers bound the
magnitudes and preserve spatial variations in the estimated endmember
coefficients. The output of SWANencoder represents estimated abundance maps
during inference, while weights of SWANdecoder are retrieved to extract
endmembers. Experiments are conducted on two benchmark synthetic data sets with
different signal-to-noise ratios as well as on three real benchmark
hyperspectral data sets while comparing the results with several
state-of-the-art neural network-based unmixing methods. The qualitative,
quantitative, and ablation results show performance enhancement by learning a
resilient unmixing function as well as promoting self-supervision and compact
network parameters for practical applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Evaluated cross-species transfer learning using ZebraPose (ViT-based model trained on synthetic zebra data) for 27-keypoint pose estimation in dairy cows. Found promising in-distribution performance but significant generalization failures across different barn environments, highlighting synthetic-to-real domain gap challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address scarcity of large annotated datasets for livestock pose estimation in agriculture, particularly dairy cattle, by exploring cross-species transfer learning from synthetic zebra data to real cow environments.

Method: Adapted ZebraPose vision transformer model trained on synthetic zebra imagery for 27-keypoint detection in dairy cows. Tested three configurations: custom on-farm dataset (375 images), APT-36K benchmark subset, and their combination. Systematically evaluated accuracy and generalization across different barn environments.

Result: Combined model achieved promising in-distribution performance (AP=0.86, AR=0.87, PCK 0.5=0.869) but showed substantial generalization failures when applied to unseen barns and cow populations. Revealed synthetic-to-real domain gap as major obstacle.

Conclusion: Morphological similarity between species is insufficient for cross-domain transfer. Need agriculture-first AI design prioritizing farm-level realism, cross-environment robustness, and open benchmark datasets for trustworthy livestock monitoring systems.

Abstract: Pose estimation serves as a cornerstone of computer vision for understanding
animal posture, behavior, and welfare. Yet, agricultural applications remain
constrained by the scarcity of large, annotated datasets for livestock,
especially dairy cattle. This study evaluates the potential and limitations of
cross-species transfer learning by adapting ZebraPose - a vision
transformer-based model trained on synthetic zebra imagery - for 27-keypoint
detection in dairy cows under real barn conditions. Using three configurations
- a custom on-farm dataset (375 images, Sussex, New Brunswick, Canada), a
subset of the APT-36K benchmark dataset, and their combination, we
systematically assessed model accuracy and generalization across environments.
While the combined model achieved promising performance (AP = 0.86, AR = 0.87,
PCK 0.5 = 0.869) on in-distribution data, substantial generalization failures
occurred when applied to unseen barns and cow populations. These findings
expose the synthetic-to-real domain gap as a major obstacle to agricultural AI
deployment and emphasize that morphological similarity between species is
insufficient for cross-domain transfer. The study provides practical insights
into dataset diversity, environmental variability, and computational
constraints that influence real-world deployment of livestock monitoring
systems. We conclude with a call for agriculture-first AI design, prioritizing
farm-level realism, cross-environment robustness, and open benchmark datasets
to advance trustworthy and scalable animal-centric technologies.

TL;DR: Proposes an analytical method to derive semantic editing directions directly from pretrained diffusion model parameters using self-attention weight matrices' eigenvectors, enabling efficient and interpretable image editing without additional data or fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for finding interpretable directions in diffusion models rely on sampling large image sets or training auxiliary networks, which limits efficiency and requires additional resources.

Method: Analyzes self-attention weight matrices in pretrained diffusion models to compute their eigenvectors, which serve as robust semantic editing directions without needing additional data or model fine-tuning.

Result: The method produces high-quality edits across multiple datasets while reducing editing time by 60% compared to current benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed analytical approach provides an efficient and effective way to achieve precise control over diffusion model outputs by leveraging inherent structural information in self-attention weights.

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve remarkable fidelity in image synthesis, yet precise
control over their outputs for targeted editing remains challenging. A key step
toward controllability is to identify interpretable directions in the model's
latent representations that correspond to semantic attributes. Existing
approaches for finding interpretable directions typically rely on sampling
large sets of images or training auxiliary networks, which limits efficiency.
We propose an analytical method that derives semantic editing directions
directly from the pretrained parameters of diffusion models, requiring neither
additional data nor fine-tuning. Our insight is that self-attention weight
matrices encode rich structural information about the data distribution learned
during training. By computing the eigenvectors of these weight matrices, we
obtain robust and interpretable editing directions. Experiments demonstrate
that our method produces high-quality edits across multiple datasets while
reducing editing time significantly by 60% over current benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SAR foundation models focus on low-level visual features but overlook multimodal alignment and zero-shot target recognition, limiting semantic understanding of SAR imagery.

Method: Constructed SARCLIP-1M dataset with 1M+ text-image pairs, then trained SARCLIP model using contrastive vision-language learning with domain transfer strategy to bridge SAR imagery and textual descriptions.

Result: Extensive experiments show SARCLIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art foundation models in image-text retrieval and zero-shot classification tasks, advancing semantic understanding of SAR imagery.

Conclusion: SARCLIP successfully bridges the gap between SAR imagery and text, enabling superior feature extraction and interpretation through multimodal alignment, marking a significant advancement in SAR semantic understanding.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has emerged as a crucial imaging modality due
to its all-weather capabilities. While recent advancements in self-supervised
learning and Masked Image Modeling (MIM) have paved the way for SAR foundation
models, these approaches primarily focus on low-level visual features, often
overlooking multimodal alignment and zero-shot target recognition within SAR
imagery. To address this limitation, we construct SARCLIP-1M, a large-scale
vision language dataset comprising over one million text-image pairs aggregated
from existing datasets. We further introduce SARCLIP, the first vision language
foundation model tailored for the SAR domain. Our SARCLIP model is trained
using a contrastive vision language learning approach by domain transferring
strategy, enabling it to bridge the gap between SAR imagery and textual
descriptions. Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval and zero-shot
classification tasks demonstrate the superior performance of SARCLIP in feature
extraction and interpretation, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
foundation models and advancing the semantic understanding of SAR imagery. The
code and datasets will be released soon.

Conclusion: LVD-GS effectively mitigates scale drift and enhances reconstruction robustness in large-scale dynamic outdoor environments through its novel hierarchical collaborative representation and dynamic object elimination approach.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM has emerged as a widely used technique for
high-fidelity mapping in spatial intelligence. However, existing methods often
rely on a single representation scheme, which limits their performance in
large-scale dynamic outdoor scenes and leads to cumulative pose errors and
scale ambiguity. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{LVD-GS}, a
novel LiDAR-Visual 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM system. Motivated by the human
chain-of-thought process for information seeking, we introduce a hierarchical
collaborative representation module that facilitates mutual reinforcement for
mapping optimization, effectively mitigating scale drift and enhancing
reconstruction robustness. Furthermore, to effectively eliminate the influence
of dynamic objects, we propose a joint dynamic modeling module that generates
fine-grained dynamic masks by fusing open-world segmentation with implicit
residual constraints, guided by uncertainty estimates from DINO-Depth features.
Extensive evaluations on KITTI, nuScenes, and self-collected datasets
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to
existing methods.

*Hagay Michaeli,Daniel Soudry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Alias-Free Vision Transformer that addresses the lack of translation invariance in standard ViTs by using alias-free downsampling/nonlinearities and shift-equivariant attention, achieving competitive classification performance with improved robustness to adversarial translations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers lack the architectural inductive bias of convnets, making them less translation-invariant and more sensitive to minor image translations. While convnets also aren't perfectly shift-invariant due to aliasing, anti-aliasing approaches exist for them, motivating similar solutions for ViTs.

Method: Proposes Alias-Free ViT with two main components: 1) alias-free downsampling and nonlinearities, and 2) linear cross-covariance attention that is shift-equivariant to both integer and fractional translations, enabling shift-invariant global representation.

Result: The model maintains competitive performance in image classification and outperforms similar-sized models in terms of robustness to adversarial translations.

Conclusion: The proposed Alias-Free ViT successfully addresses the translation invariance limitations of standard Vision Transformers while maintaining competitive performance and improving robustness to adversarial translations.

Abstract: Transformers have emerged as a competitive alternative to convnets in vision
tasks, yet they lack the architectural inductive bias of convnets, which may
hinder their potential performance. Specifically, Vision Transformers (ViTs)
are not translation-invariant and are more sensitive to minor image
translations than standard convnets. Previous studies have shown, however, that
convnets are also not perfectly shift-invariant, due to aliasing in
downsampling and nonlinear layers. Consequently, anti-aliasing approaches have
been proposed to certify convnets' translation robustness. Building on this
line of work, we propose an Alias-Free ViT, which combines two main components.
First, it uses alias-free downsampling and nonlinearities. Second, it uses
linear cross-covariance attention that is shift-equivariant to both integer and
fractional translations, enabling a shift-invariant global representation. Our
model maintains competitive performance in image classification and outperforms
similar-sized models in terms of robustness to adversarial translations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAMap is a novel HD map construction method that addresses task misalignment in current approaches through three components: Distance-aware Focal Loss for better classification labels, Task Modulated Deformable Attention for discriminative features, and Hybrid Loss Scheme to optimize training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HD map prediction methods perform poorly in high-quality predictions due to inherent task misalignment caused by inappropriate task labels from one-to-many matching queries and sub-optimal task features from task-shared sampling mechanisms.

Method: DAMap consists of three key components: 1) Distance-aware Focal Loss (DAFL) for assigning appropriate classification labels, 2) Task Modulated Deformable Attention (TMDA) for obtaining discriminative task-specific features, and 3) Hybrid Loss Scheme (HLS) to better utilize DAFL advantages.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent performance improvement on NuScenes and Argoverse2 benchmarks across different metrics, baselines, splits, backbones, and training schedules.

Conclusion: DAMap effectively addresses the inherent defects in current HD map construction methods and achieves superior performance in high-quality map element prediction, which is crucial for autonomous driving safety.

Abstract: Predicting High-definition (HD) map elements with high quality (high
classification and localization scores) is crucial to the safety of autonomous
driving vehicles. However, current methods perform poorly in high quality
predictions due to inherent task misalignment. Two main factors are responsible
for misalignment: 1) inappropriate task labels due to one-to-many matching
queries sharing the same labels, and 2) sub-optimal task features due to
task-shared sampling mechanism. In this paper, we reveal two inherent defects
in current methods and develop a novel HD map construction method named DAMap
to address these problems. Specifically, DAMap consists of three components:
Distance-aware Focal Loss (DAFL), Hybrid Loss Scheme (HLS), and Task Modulated
Deformable Attention (TMDA). The DAFL is introduced to assign appropriate
classification labels for one-to-many matching samples. The TMDA is proposed to
obtain discriminative task-specific features. Furthermore, the HLS is proposed
to better utilize the advantages of the DAFL. We perform extensive experiments
and consistently achieve performance improvement on the NuScenes and Argoverse2
benchmarks under different metrics, baselines, splits, backbones, and
schedules. Code will be available at https://github.com/jpdong-xjtu/DAMap.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Key building metadata like construction year and structure type are often missing or outdated in Japan's second-hand housing market, making disaster risk assessment and insurance pricing difficult.

Method: Multi-task learning model that jointly estimates construction year, building structure, and property type from facade images, then derives fireproof classification (H/T/M) via rule-based mapping based on official insurance criteria.

Result: The model achieved high accuracy in construction-year regression and robust classification across imbalanced categories, capturing visual cues related to building age and materials.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates feasibility of scalable, interpretable, image-based risk-profiling systems with applications in insurance, urban planning, and disaster preparedness.

Abstract: Structural fireproof classification is vital for disaster risk assessment and
insurance pricing in Japan. However, key building metadata such as construction
year and structure type are often missing or outdated, particularly in the
second-hand housing market. This study proposes a multi-task learning model
that predicts these attributes from facade images. The model jointly estimates
the construction year, building structure, and property type, from which the
structural fireproof class - defined as H (non-fireproof), T (semi-fireproof),
or M (fireproof) - is derived via a rule-based mapping based on official
insurance criteria. We trained and evaluated the model using a large-scale
dataset of Japanese residential images, applying rigorous filtering and
deduplication. The model achieved high accuracy in construction-year regression
and robust classification across imbalanced categories. Qualitative analyses
show that it captures visual cues related to building age and materials. Our
approach demonstrates the feasibility of scalable, interpretable, image-based
risk-profiling systems, offering potential applications in insurance, urban

### [123] [RoboSVG: A Unified Framework for Interactive SVG Generation with Multi-modal Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22684)
*Jiuniu Wang,Gongjie Zhang,Quanhao Qian,Junlong Gao,Deli Zhao,Ran Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RoboSVG is a multimodal framework that generates interactive SVGs using text, visual, and numerical guidance, supported by the RoboDraw dataset of 1 million examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SVGs are fundamental for digital design and robot control, encoding both visual structure and motion paths, but current methods lack unified multimodal guidance for interactive SVG generation.

Method: RoboSVG first produces multimodal guidance from input queries, synthesizes candidate SVGs through dedicated generation modules, and refines them under numerical guidance using the RoboDraw dataset.

Result: Extensive experiments show RoboSVG achieves superior query compliance and visual fidelity across tasks, establishing new state-of-the-art in versatile SVG generation.

Conclusion: RoboSVG provides a unified framework for interactive SVG generation with multimodal guidance, and the RoboDraw dataset enables systematic study of SVG generation tasks.

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are fundamental to digital design and robot
control, encoding not only visual structure but also motion paths in
interactive drawings. In this work, we introduce RoboSVG, a unified multimodal
framework for generating interactive SVGs guided by textual, visual, and
numerical signals. Given an input query, the RoboSVG model first produces
multimodal guidance, then synthesizes candidate SVGs through dedicated
generation modules, and finally refines them under numerical guidance to yield
high-quality outputs. To support this framework, we construct RoboDraw, a
large-scale dataset of one million examples, each pairing an SVG generation
condition (e.g., text, image, and partial SVG) with its corresponding
ground-truth SVG code. RoboDraw dataset enables systematic study of four tasks,
including basic generation (Text-to-SVG, Image-to-SVG) and interactive
generation (PartialSVG-to-SVG, PartialImage-to-SVG). Extensive experiments
demonstrate that RoboSVG achieves superior query compliance and visual fidelity
across tasks, establishing a new state of the art in versatile SVG generation.
The dataset and source code of this project will be publicly available soon.

### [124] [VADTree: Explainable Training-Free Video Anomaly Detection via Hierarchical Granularity-Aware Tree](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22693)
*Wenlong Li,Yifei Xu,Yuan Rao,Zhenhua Wang,Shuiguang Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VADTree is a training-free video anomaly detection method that uses hierarchical granularity-aware tree structure for flexible temporal sampling, leveraging pre-trained GEBD model for event boundary detection and VLMs/LLMs for anomaly reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current training-free VAD methods use fixed-length temporal windows which struggle to capture anomalies with varying temporal spans, and supervised methods require substantial training data without clear anomaly explanations.

Method: Uses Hierarchical Granularity-aware Tree (HGTree) structure with GEBD model for event boundary detection, performs adaptive coarse-fine hierarchical structuring, injects multi-dimensional priors into VLMs for node-wise anomaly perception, and uses LLMs for anomaly reasoning with inter-cluster node correlation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three challenging datasets in training-free settings while drastically reducing the number of sampled video segments.

Conclusion: VADTree effectively addresses the limitations of fixed-length temporal sampling in VAD by providing flexible, hierarchical event-based analysis through the integration of GEBD, VLMs, and LLMs.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies in videos.
Supervised methods demand substantial in-domain training data and fail to
deliver clear explanations for anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods
leverage the knowledge reserves and language interactivity of large pre-trained
models to detect anomalies. However, the current fixed-length temporal window
sampling approaches struggle to accurately capture anomalies with varying
temporal spans. Therefore, we propose VADTree that utilizes a Hierarchical
Granularityaware Tree (HGTree) structure for flexible sampling in VAD. VADTree
leverages the knowledge embedded in a pre-trained Generic Event Boundary
Detection (GEBD) model to characterize potential anomaly event boundaries.
Specifically, VADTree decomposes the video into generic event nodes based on
boundary confidence, and performs adaptive coarse-fine hierarchical structuring
and redundancy removal to construct the HGTree. Then, the multi-dimensional
priors are injected into the visual language models (VLMs) to enhance the
node-wise anomaly perception, and anomaly reasoning for generic event nodes is
achieved via large language models (LLMs). Finally, an inter-cluster node
correlation method is used to integrate the multi-granularity anomaly scores.
Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate that VADTree
achieves state-of-the-art performance in training-free settings while
drastically reducing the number of sampled video segments. The code will be
available at https://github.com/wenlongli10/VADTree.

*Shu Zhao,Tianyi Shen,Nilesh Ahuja,Omesh Tickoo,Vijaykrishnan Narayanan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Windsock introduces a query-dependent module for dynamic retrieval and modality selection in MRAG, combined with DANCE instruction tuning to enhance MLLMs' ability to utilize retrieved information while maintaining noise robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MRAG approaches suffer from static retrieval strategies, inflexible modality selection, and suboptimal utilization of retrieved information, leading to challenges in determining when to retrieve, what modality to incorporate, and how to utilize retrieved information effectively.

Method: Proposed Windsock module for query-dependent retrieval decisions and modality selection, DANCE Instruction Tuning for adaptive training to enhance information utilization while maintaining noise robustness, and self-assessment approach to convert QA datasets to MRAG training datasets.

Result: Significant improvement in generation quality by 17.07% while reducing retrieval times by 8.95% in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the key challenges in MRAG by providing dynamic retrieval strategies, flexible modality selection, and optimal utilization of retrieved information, leading to substantial improvements in both efficiency and quality.

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) has emerged as a promising
method to generate factual and up-to-date responses of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating non-parametric knowledge from external
knowledge bases. However, existing MRAG approaches suffer from static retrieval
strategies, inflexible modality selection, and suboptimal utilization of
retrieved information, leading to three critical challenges: determining when
to retrieve, what modality to incorporate, and how to utilize retrieved
information effectively. To address these challenges, we introduce Windsock, a
query-dependent module making decisions on retrieval necessity and modality
selection, effectively reducing computational overhead and improving response
quality. Additionally, we propose Dynamic Noise-Resistance (DANCE) Instruction
Tuning, an adaptive training strategy that enhances MLLMs' ability to utilize
retrieved information while maintaining robustness against noise. Moreover, we
adopt a self-assessment approach leveraging knowledge within MLLMs to convert
question-answering datasets to MRAG training datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the generation
quality by 17.07% while reducing 8.95% retrieval times.

### [126] [WaveMAE: Wavelet decomposition Masked Auto-Encoder for Remote Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22697)
*Vittorio Bernuzzi,Leonardo Rossi,Tomaso Fontanini,Massimo Bertozzi,Andrea Prati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaveMAE is a masked autoencoding framework for multispectral satellite imagery that uses Discrete Wavelet Transform for frequency-aware representation learning and Geo-conditioned Positional Encoding for geographical priors, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple remote sensing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-supervised learning is needed for remote sensing due to limited annotated data, and current approaches lack effective handling of frequency components and geographical information in multispectral imagery.

Method: Uses masked autoencoding with multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform for frequency disentanglement and Geo-conditioned Positional Encoding via Spherical Harmonics to incorporate geographical priors.

Result: Achieves consistent improvements over prior state-of-the-art approaches with substantial gains on segmentation and regression benchmarks. Even a lightweight variant with 26.4% parameters achieves SOTA performance.

Conclusion: WaveMAE establishes itself as a strong and geographically informed foundation model for multispectral remote sensing imagery.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently emerged as a key strategy for
building foundation models in remote sensing, where the scarcity of annotated
data limits the applicability of fully supervised approaches. In this work, we
introduce WaveMAE, a masked autoencoding framework tailored for multispectral
satellite imagery. Unlike conventional pixel-based reconstruction, WaveMAE
leverages a multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to disentangle
frequency components and guide the encoder toward learning scale-aware
high-frequency representations. We further propose a Geo-conditioned Positional
Encoding (GPE), which incorporates geographical priors via Spherical Harmonics,
encouraging embeddings that respect both semantic and geospatial structure. To
ensure fairness in evaluation, all methods are pretrained on the same dataset
(fMoW-S2) and systematically evaluated on the diverse downstream tasks of the
PANGAEA benchmark, spanning semantic segmentation, regression, change
detection, and multilabel classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that WaveMAE achieves consistent improvements over prior state-of-the-art
approaches, with substantial gains on segmentation and regression benchmarks.
The effectiveness of WaveMAE pretraining is further demonstrated by showing
that even a lightweight variant, containing only 26.4% of the parameters,
achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our results establish WaveMAE as a
strong and geographically informed foundation model for multispectral remote
sensing imagery.

### [127] [IGGT: Instance-Grounded Geometry Transformer for Semantic 3D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22706)
*Hao Li,Zhengyu Zou,Fangfu Liu,Xuanyang Zhang,Fangzhou Hong,Yukang Cao,Yushi Lan,Manyuan Zhang,Gang Yu,Dingwen Zhang,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IGGT is an end-to-end transformer that unifies 3D spatial reconstruction and instance-level semantic understanding through 3D-consistent contrastive learning, using only 2D visual inputs to create coherent 3D scenes with distinct object instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior approaches treat 3D geometry reconstruction and semantic understanding separately, limiting generalization and downstream task performance. Simple alignment methods restrict perception to aligned models' capacity and limit adaptability.

Method: Proposed InstanceGrounded Geometry Transformer (IGGT) with 3D-Consistent Contrastive Learning strategy to encode unified representations of geometric structures and instance-grounded clustering from 2D visual inputs. Created InsScene-15K dataset with RGB images, poses, depth maps, and 3D-consistent instance masks.

Result: IGGT enables consistent lifting of 2D visual inputs into coherent 3D scenes with explicitly distinct object instances, supporting both spatial reconstruction and instance-level contextual understanding.

Conclusion: The proposed unified approach addresses the crucial interplay between 3D geometry and semantic understanding, overcoming limitations of prior isolated methods and enabling better generalization for downstream 3D understanding tasks.

Abstract: Humans naturally perceive the geometric structure and semantic content of a
3D world as intertwined dimensions, enabling coherent and accurate
understanding of complex scenes. However, most prior approaches prioritize
training large geometry models for low-level 3D reconstruction and treat
high-level spatial understanding in isolation, overlooking the crucial
interplay between these two fundamental aspects of 3D-scene analysis, thereby
limiting generalization and leading to poor performance in downstream 3D
understanding tasks. Recent attempts have mitigated this issue by simply
aligning 3D models with specific language models, thus restricting perception
to the aligned model's capacity and limiting adaptability to downstream tasks.
In this paper, we propose InstanceGrounded Geometry Transformer (IGGT), an
end-to-end large unified transformer to unify the knowledge for both spatial
reconstruction and instance-level contextual understanding. Specifically, we
design a 3D-Consistent Contrastive Learning strategy that guides IGGT to encode
a unified representation with geometric structures and instance-grounded
clustering through only 2D visual inputs. This representation supports
consistent lifting of 2D visual inputs into a coherent 3D scene with explicitly
distinct object instances. To facilitate this task, we further construct
InsScene-15K, a large-scale dataset with high-quality RGB images, poses, depth
maps, and 3D-consistent instance-level mask annotations with a novel data
curation pipeline.

Motivation: To address the scarcity of non-English visual speech recognition resources and support research for hearing-impaired technologies in underrepresented languages like Persian.

Method: Created an automated end-to-end curation pipeline using ASR transcription, active-speaker localization, quality filtering, and pose/mask screening from 67 TV programs.

Result: Established reference performance by fine-tuning two lipreading architectures, demonstrating the difficulty of Persian visual speech recognition.

Conclusion: LRW-Persian fills a critical gap for low-resource languages, enabling rigorous benchmarking, cross-lingual transfer, and advancing multimodal speech research in Persian.

Abstract: Lipreading has emerged as an increasingly important research area for
developing robust speech recognition systems and assistive technologies for the
hearing-impaired. However, non-English resources for visual speech recognition
remain limited. We introduce LRW-Persian, the largest in-the-wild Persian
word-level lipreading dataset, comprising $743$ target words and over
$414{,}000$ video samples extracted from more than $1{,}900$ hours of footage
across $67$ television programs. Designed as a benchmark-ready resource,
LRW-Persian provides speaker-disjoint training and test splits, wide regional
and dialectal coverage, and rich per-clip metadata including head pose, age,
and gender. To ensure large-scale data quality, we establish a fully automated
end-to-end curation pipeline encompassing transcription based on Automatic
Speech Recognition(ASR), active-speaker localization, quality filtering, and
pose/mask screening. We further fine-tune two widely used lipreading
architectures on LRW-Persian, establishing reference performance and
demonstrating the difficulty of Persian visual speech recognition. By filling a
critical gap in low-resource languages, LRW-Persian enables rigorous
benchmarking, supports cross-lingual transfer, and provides a foundation for
advancing multimodal speech research in underrepresented linguistic contexts.

### [129] [Cross-view Localization and Synthesis -- Datasets, Challenges and Opportunities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22736)
*Ningli Xu,Rongjun Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper provides a comprehensive survey of cross-view visual understanding tasks, focusing on cross-view localization (estimating geographic position of ground images using overhead imagery) and cross-view synthesis (generating ground-level images from overhead imagery).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-view tasks have gained importance due to their applications in autonomous navigation, urban planning, and augmented reality, but remain challenging due to significant perspective, resolution, and occlusion differences between overhead and ground-level imagery.

Method: The survey reviews datasets, challenges, and state-of-the-art techniques. Cross-view localization is typically formulated as image retrieval using CNNs or ViTs for feature embedding, while cross-view synthesis uses GANs or diffusion models for image generation.

Result: The paper organizes current advances in both tasks, provides comparative analyses of existing approaches, and identifies key challenges in the field.

Conclusion: The survey outlines promising future research directions and discusses current limitations in cross-view localization and synthesis, while maintaining an updated project page for ongoing developments in the field.

Abstract: Cross-view localization and synthesis are two fundamental tasks in cross-view
visual understanding, which deals with cross-view datasets: overhead (satellite
or aerial) and ground-level imagery. These tasks have gained increasing
attention due to their broad applications in autonomous navigation, urban
planning, and augmented reality. Cross-view localization aims to estimate the
geographic position of ground-level images based on information provided by
overhead imagery while cross-view synthesis seeks to generate ground-level
images based on information from the overhead imagery. Both tasks remain
challenging due to significant differences in viewing perspective, resolution,
and occlusion, which are widely embedded in cross-view datasets. Recent years
have witnessed rapid progress driven by the availability of large-scale
datasets and novel approaches. Typically, cross-view localization is formulated
as an image retrieval problem where ground-level features are matched with
tiled overhead images feature, extracted by convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) or vision transformers (ViTs) for cross-view feature embedding.
Cross-view synthesis, on the other hand, seeks to generate ground-level views
based on information from overhead imagery, generally using generative
adversarial networks (GANs) or diffusion models. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey of advances in cross-view localization and synthesis,
reviewing widely used datasets, highlighting key challenges, and providing an
organized overview of state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, it discusses
current limitations, offers comparative analyses, and outlines promising
directions for future research. We also include the project page via

*Raihan Ahamed Rifat,Fuyad Hasan Bhoyan,Md Humaion Kabir Mehedi,Md Kaviul Hossain,Md. Jakir Hossen,M. F. Mridha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ConMatFormer is a hybrid deep learning architecture combining ConvNeXt blocks, attention mechanisms (CBAM and DANet), and transformer modules for improved diabetic foot ulcer detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 97.55% accuracy and enhanced explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diabetic foot ulcer detection faces challenges due to scarcity and variability of public datasets, requiring better feature extraction and global context understanding to accurately model small skin patterns across different DFU types.

Method: Proposed ConMatFormer hybrid architecture using ConvNeXt blocks for local features, multiple attention mechanisms (CBAM and DANet), and transformer modules for long-range dependencies. Applied data augmentation to address class imbalance and used explainable AI methods (Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, LIME) for transparency.

Result: Achieved 0.8961 accuracy and 0.9160 precision in single experiment, and 0.9755 accuracy with 0.0031 standard deviation in 4-fold cross-validation on DFUC2021 and DFU datasets, outperforming SOTA CNN and ViT models in accuracy, reliability, and flexibility.

Conclusion: ConMatFormer sets a new benchmark for DFU classification and provides a hybrid attention transformer framework for medical image analysis, demonstrating significant improvement over current standards with enhanced transparency and trustworthiness.

Abstract: Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) detection is a clinically significant yet
challenging task due to the scarcity and variability of publicly available
datasets. To solve these problems, we propose ConMatFormer, a new hybrid deep
learning architecture that combines ConvNeXt blocks, multiple attention
mechanisms convolutional block attention module (CBAM) and dual attention
network (DANet), and transformer modules in a way that works together. This
design facilitates the extraction of better local features and understanding of
the global context, which allows us to model small skin patterns across
different types of DFU very accurately. To address the class imbalance, we used
data augmentation methods. A ConvNeXt block was used to obtain detailed local
features in the initial stages. Subsequently, we compiled the model by adding a
transformer module to enhance long-range dependency. This enabled us to
pinpoint the DFU classes that were underrepresented or constituted minorities.
Tests on the DS1 (DFUC2021) and DS2 (diabetic foot ulcer (DFU)) datasets showed
that ConMatFormer outperformed state-of-the-art (SOTA) convolutional neural
network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models in terms of accuracy,
reliability, and flexibility. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of
0.8961 and a precision of 0.9160 in a single experiment, which is a significant
improvement over the current standards for classifying DFUs. In addition, by
4-fold cross-validation, the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 0.9755 with
a standard deviation of only 0.0031. We further applied explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) methods, such as Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and LIME, to
consistently monitor the transparency and trustworthiness of the
decision-making process.. Our findings set a new benchmark for DFU
classification and provide a hybrid attention transformer framework for medical
image analysis.

*Jiaxiang Liu,Jiawei Du,Xiao Liu,Prayag Tiwari,Mingkun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCC is a test-time defense method that improves CLIP's zero-shot robustness against adversarial attacks through semantic and spatial consistency modules, without requiring labeled data for fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CLIP models are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that disrupt image-text alignment, and existing defenses rely on adversarial fine-tuning with labeled data, limiting their applicability in zero-shot settings.

Method: Self-Calibrated Consistency (SCC) uses two modules: semantic consistency with pseudo-labels and multi-view predictions to maintain cross-modal alignment, and spatial consistency with augmented views to stabilize inference under perturbations.

Result: Extensive experiments on 22 benchmarks show SCC consistently improves CLIP's zero-shot robustness while maintaining accuracy, and can be integrated with other VLMs for further gains.

Conclusion: SCC demonstrates the potential for establishing an adversarially robust paradigm from CLIP, with implications extending to broader vision-language domains including BioMedCLIP.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated
strong zero-shot capabilities across diverse domains, yet remain highly
vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that disrupt image-text alignment and
compromise reliability. Existing defenses typically rely on adversarial
fine-tuning with labeled data, limiting their applicability in zero-shot
settings. In this work, we identify two key weaknesses of current CLIP
adversarial attacks -- lack of semantic guidance and vulnerability to view
variations -- collectively termed semantic and viewpoint fragility. To address
these challenges, we propose Self-Calibrated Consistency (SCC), an effective
test-time defense. SCC consists of two complementary modules: Semantic
consistency, which leverages soft pseudo-labels from counterattack warm-up and
multi-view predictions to regularize cross-modal alignment and separate the
target embedding from confusable negatives; and Spatial consistency, aligning
perturbed visual predictions via augmented views to stabilize inference under
adversarial perturbations. Together, these modules form a plug-and-play
inference strategy. Extensive experiments on 22 benchmarks under diverse attack
settings show that SCC consistently improves the zero-shot robustness of CLIP
while maintaining accuracy, and can be seamlessly integrated with other VLMs
for further gains. These findings highlight the great potential of establishing
an adversarially robust paradigm from CLIP, with implications extending to
broader vision-language domains such as BioMedCLIP.

Abstract: Explainability is critical for the clinical adoption of medical visual
question answering (VQA) systems, as physicians require transparent reasoning
to trust AI-generated diagnoses. We present MedXplain-VQA, a comprehensive
framework integrating five explainable AI components to deliver interpretable
medical image analysis. The framework leverages a fine-tuned BLIP-2 backbone,
medical query reformulation, enhanced Grad-CAM attention, precise region
extraction, and structured chain-of-thought reasoning via multi-modal language
models. To evaluate the system, we introduce a medical-domain-specific
framework replacing traditional NLP metrics with clinically relevant
assessments, including terminology coverage, clinical structure quality, and
attention region relevance. Experiments on 500 PathVQA histopathology samples
demonstrate substantial improvements, with the enhanced system achieving a
composite score of 0.683 compared to 0.378 for baseline methods, while
maintaining high reasoning confidence (0.890). Our system identifies 3-5
diagnostically relevant regions per sample and generates structured

TL;DR: MAGIC-Talk is a one-shot diffusion-based framework for customizable and temporally stable talking face generation that preserves identity from a single reference image while enabling fine-grained facial editing via text prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current audio-driven talking face generation methods struggle with temporal consistency, identity preservation, and customization, especially in long video generation scenarios.

Method: Proposes a framework with ReferenceNet for identity preservation and facial editing via text prompts, and AnimateNet for motion coherence using structured motion priors. Uses progressive latent fusion strategy to improve long-form video quality.

Result: Extensive experiments show MAGIC-Talk outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality, identity preservation, and synchronization accuracy.

Conclusion: MAGIC-Talk offers a robust solution for talking face generation that addresses key limitations of previous approaches while enabling customization and maintaining temporal stability.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking face generation has gained significant attention for
applications in digital media and virtual avatars. While recent methods improve
audio-lip synchronization, they often struggle with temporal consistency,
identity preservation, and customization, especially in long video generation.
To address these issues, we propose MAGIC-Talk, a one-shot diffusion-based
framework for customizable and temporally stable talking face generation.
MAGIC-Talk consists of ReferenceNet, which preserves identity and enables
fine-grained facial editing via text prompts, and AnimateNet, which enhances
motion coherence using structured motion priors. Unlike previous methods
requiring multiple reference images or fine-tuning, MAGIC-Talk maintains
identity from a single image while ensuring smooth transitions across frames.
Additionally, a progressive latent fusion strategy is introduced to improve
long-form video quality by reducing motion inconsistencies and flickering.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAGIC-Talk outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in visual quality, identity preservation, and synchronization accuracy,
offering a robust solution for talking face generation.

*Zahraa Al Sahili,Maryam Fetanat,Maimuna Nowaz,Ioannis Patras,Matthew Purver*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FairJudge is a lightweight evaluation protocol that uses instruction-following multimodal LLMs as fair judges to assess how well text-to-image systems match prompts and handle social attributes, providing more reliable fairness audits than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image evaluation methods lack reproducible ways to measure image-prompt alignment and social attribute treatment, relying on proxies like face classifiers and contrastive similarity that reward surface cues and miss weakly visible attributes.

Method: FairJudge treats multimodal LLMs as fair judges with an explanation-oriented rubric scored on [-1,1], constrains judgments to closed label sets, requires evidence grounded in visible content, and mandates abstention when cues are insufficient.

Result: Across multiple datasets (FairFace, PaTA, FairCoT, IdenProf, FairCoT-Professions, DIVERSIFY-Professions), judge models outperform contrastive and face-centric baselines on demographic prediction and improve mean alignment while maintaining high profession accuracy.

Conclusion: FairJudge enables more reliable and reproducible fairness audits for text-to-image systems by providing accountable, evidence-aware decisions that address evaluation fairness without altering generators.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) systems lack simple, reproducible ways to evaluate how
well images match prompts and how models treat social attributes. Common
proxies -- face classifiers and contrastive similarity -- reward surface cues,
lack calibrated abstention, and miss attributes only weakly visible (for
example, religion, culture, disability). We present FairJudge, a lightweight
protocol that treats instruction-following multimodal LLMs as fair judges. It
scores alignment with an explanation-oriented rubric mapped to [-1, 1];
constrains judgments to a closed label set; requires evidence grounded in the
visible content; and mandates abstention when cues are insufficient. Unlike
CLIP-only pipelines, FairJudge yields accountable, evidence-aware decisions;
unlike mitigation that alters generators, it targets evaluation fairness. We
evaluate gender, race, and age on FairFace, PaTA, and FairCoT; extend to
religion, culture, and disability; and assess profession correctness and
alignment on IdenProf, FairCoT-Professions, and our new DIVERSIFY-Professions.
We also release DIVERSIFY, a 469-image corpus of diverse, non-iconic scenes.
Across datasets, judge models outperform contrastive and face-centric baselines
on demographic prediction and improve mean alignment while maintaining high
profession accuracy, enabling more reliable, reproducible fairness audits.

TL;DR: A multimodal fusion system using Gemma-3 LLM with ViT visual and E5 textual features, enhanced by LLM-generated rationale prompts, outperforms gradient boosted tree ensembles in predicting commercial memorability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To predict commercial memorability as part of the MediaEval 2025 competition, addressing the need for robust and generalizable models in this domain.

Method: Multimodal fusion with Gemma-3 LLM backbone integrating pre-computed ViT visual and E5 textual features via multi-modal projections, adapted using LoRA, and guided by LLM-generated rationale prompts based on expert-derived memorability aspects.

Result: The LLM-based system demonstrated greater robustness and generalization performance on the final test set compared to the gradient boosted tree baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM-based multimodal fusion approach with rationale prompting is effective for commercial memorability prediction, showing superior performance over traditional ensemble methods.

Abstract: This paper addresses the prediction of commercial (brand) memorability as
part of "Subtask 2: Commercial/Ad Memorability" within the "Memorability:
Predicting movie and commercial memorability" task at the MediaEval 2025
workshop competition. We propose a multimodal fusion system with a Gemma-3 LLM
backbone that integrates pre-computed visual (ViT) and textual (E5) features by
multi-modal projections. The model is adapted using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).
A heavily-tuned ensemble of gradient boosted trees serves as a baseline. A key
contribution is the use of LLM-generated rationale prompts, grounded in
expert-derived aspects of memorability, to guide the fusion model. The results
demonstrate that the LLM-based system exhibits greater robustness and
generalization performance on the final test set, compared to the baseline.

*Aya Nakayama,Brian Wong,Yuji Nishimura,Kaito Tanaka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SP-CSVR is a novel framework that addresses the "style trap" problem in Large Vision-Language Models by enabling robust semantic understanding across diverse visual styles through style-content disentanglement and cross-style semantic consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: Extensive experiments show SP-CSVR achieves state-of-the-art performance across visual captioning, visual question answering, and in-context style adaptation on a challenging multi-style dataset.

Conclusion: SP-CSVR effectively enhances robustness, generalization, and efficiency across diverse visual styles, as confirmed by comprehensive evaluations including ablation studies and generalization analysis.

Abstract: The "style trap" poses a significant challenge for Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs), hindering robust semantic understanding across diverse visual
styles, especially in in-context learning (ICL). Existing methods often fail to
effectively decouple style from content, hindering generalization. To address
this, we propose the Semantic-Preserving Cross-Style Visual Reasoner (SP-CSVR),
a novel framework for stable semantic understanding and adaptive cross-style
visual reasoning. SP-CSVR integrates a Cross-Style Feature Encoder (CSFE) for
style-content disentanglement, a Semantic-Aligned In-Context Decoder (SAICD)
for efficient few-shot style adaptation, and an Adaptive Semantic Consistency
Module (ASCM) employing multi-task contrastive learning to enforce cross-style
semantic invariance. Extensive experiments on a challenging multi-style dataset
demonstrate SP-CSVR's state-of-the-art performance across visual captioning,
visual question answering, and in-context style adaptation. Comprehensive
evaluations, including ablation studies and generalization analysis, confirm
SP-CSVR's efficacy in enhancing robustness, generalization, and efficiency
across diverse visual styles.

*Omri Hirsch,Ron Shapira Weber,Shira Ifergane,Oren Freifeld*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastJAM is a fast graph-based method for joint image alignment that reduces computational complexity from hours/minutes to seconds while achieving better alignment quality than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing joint alignment approaches require long training times, large models, and extensive hyperparameter tuning, creating a need for more efficient methods.

Method: Leverages pairwise matches from off-the-shelf image matchers and rapid nonparametric clustering to build a graph of keypoint relations, then uses a graph neural network to propagate correspondences and predict homography parameters via image-level pooling with an inverse-compositional loss.

Result: Achieves better alignment quality than existing modern JA methods while reducing computation time from hours/minutes to mere seconds on several benchmarks.

Conclusion: FastJAM provides a rapid and effective solution for joint image alignment that eliminates the need for regularization terms and associated hyperparameter tuning while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Joint Alignment (JA) of images aims to align a collection of images into a
unified coordinate frame, such that semantically-similar features appear at
corresponding spatial locations. Most existing approaches often require long
training times, large-capacity models, and extensive hyperparameter tuning. We
introduce FastJAM, a rapid, graph-based method that drastically reduces the
computational complexity of joint alignment tasks. FastJAM leverages pairwise
matches computed by an off-the-shelf image matcher, together with a rapid
nonparametric clustering, to construct a graph representing intra- and
inter-image keypoint relations. A graph neural network propagates and
aggregates these correspondences, efficiently predicting per-image homography
parameters via image-level pooling. Utilizing an inverse-compositional loss,
that eliminates the need for a regularization term over the predicted
transformations (and thus also obviates the hyperparameter tuning associated
with such terms), FastJAM performs image JA quickly and effectively.
Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that FastJAM achieves
results better than existing modern JA methods in terms of alignment quality,
while reducing computation time from hours or minutes to mere seconds. Our code
is available at our project webpage, https://bgu-cs-vil.github.io/FastJAM/

### [138] [Semantic Surgery: Zero-Shot Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22851)
*Lexiang Xiong,Chengyu Liu,Jingwen Ye,Yan Liu,Yuecong Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Semantic Surgery is a training-free, zero-shot framework for concept erasure in text-to-image diffusion models that operates on text embeddings before diffusion, using calibrated vector subtraction to neutralize target concepts while preserving image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept erasure methods often compromise generative quality, so there's a need for a method that can effectively remove harmful content while maintaining image quality.

Method: Dynamic estimation of target concepts in prompts followed by calibrated vector subtraction on text embeddings, with Co-Occurrence Encoding for multi-concept erasure and visual feedback loop for latent concept persistence.

Result: Superior performance across object erasure (93.58 H-score), explicit content reduction (to just 1 instance), and style erasure (8.09 H_a) with no quality degradation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Semantic Surgery provides a practical training-free solution for safer text-to-image generation that can also function as a built-in threat detection system.

Abstract: Concept erasure in text-to-image diffusion models is crucial for mitigating
harmful content, yet existing methods often compromise generative quality. We
introduce Semantic Surgery, a novel training-free, zero-shot framework for
concept erasure that operates directly on text embeddings before the diffusion
process. It dynamically estimates the presence of target concepts in a prompt
and performs a calibrated vector subtraction to neutralize their influence at
the source, enhancing both erasure completeness and locality. The framework
includes a Co-Occurrence Encoding module for robust multi-concept erasure and a
visual feedback loop to address latent concept persistence. As a training-free
method, Semantic Surgery adapts dynamically to each prompt, ensuring precise
interventions. Extensive experiments on object, explicit content, artistic
style, and multi-celebrity erasure tasks show our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. We achieve superior completeness and
robustness while preserving locality and image quality (e.g., 93.58 H-score in
object erasure, reducing explicit content to just 1 instance, and 8.09 H_a in
style erasure with no quality degradation). This robustness also allows our
framework to function as a built-in threat detection system, offering a
practical solution for safer text-to-image generation.

### [139] [Seeing the Unseen: Towards Zero-Shot Inspection for Wind Turbine Blades using Knowledge-Augmented Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22868)
*Yang Zhang,Qianyu Zhou,Farhad Imani,Jiong Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a zero-shot inspection framework using RAG with Vision-Language Models for wind turbine blade damage detection, eliminating need for large labeled datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of traditional deep learning approaches that require large labeled datasets, which are difficult to obtain for rare or evolving damage types in wind turbine blades.

Method: Integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Vision-Language Models (VLM), using a multimodal knowledge base with technical documentation, reference images, and domain guidelines. Uses hybrid text-image retriever with keyword-aware reranking to provide relevant context.

Result: Achieved 100% correct classification on 30 labeled blade images covering diverse damage categories, outperforming the same VLM without retrieval in both accuracy and precision. Framework provides explainability and generalizability for detecting previously unseen defects.

Conclusion: Presents a data-efficient industrial inspection solution that reduces dependency on extensive labeled datasets while maintaining high accuracy and enabling detection of novel defects through domain knowledge.

Abstract: Wind turbine blades operate in harsh environments, making timely damage
detection essential for preventing failures and optimizing maintenance.
Drone-based inspection and deep learning are promising, but typically depend on
large, labeled datasets, which limit their ability to detect rare or evolving
damage types. To address this, we propose a zero-shot-oriented inspection
framework that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with
Vision-Language Models (VLM). A multimodal knowledge base is constructed,
comprising technical documentation, representative reference images, and
domain-specific guidelines. A hybrid text-image retriever with keyword-aware
reranking assembles the most relevant context to condition the VLM at
inference, injecting domain knowledge without task-specific training. We
evaluate the framework on 30 labeled blade images covering diverse damage
categories. Although the dataset is small due to the difficulty of acquiring
verified blade imagery, it covers multiple representative defect types. On this
test set, the RAG-grounded VLM correctly classified all samples, whereas the
same VLM without retrieval performed worse in both accuracy and precision. We
further compare against open-vocabulary baselines and incorporate uncertainty
Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals to account for the small-sample setting.
Ablation studies indicate that the key advantage of the framework lies in
explainability and generalizability: retrieved references ground the reasoning
process and enable the detection of previously unseen defects by leveraging
domain knowledge rather than relying solely on visual cues. This research
contributes a data-efficient solution for industrial inspection that reduces
dependence on extensive labeled datasets.

*Qiyu Liao,Dadong Wang,Rebecca Haling,Jiajun Liu,Xun Li,Martyna Plomecka,Andrew Robson,Matthew Pringle,Rhys Pirie,Megan Walker,Joshua Whelan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dataset of 1,162 annotated pasture images with biomass measurements for machine learning-based pasture biomass estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate pasture biomass estimation is crucial for livestock production systems to optimize stocking rates, prevent overgrazing, and maintain system health.

Method: Created a comprehensive dataset of top-view pasture images across 19 Australian locations with paired ground measurements including biomass components, vegetation height, and NDVI from Active Optical Sensors.

Result: A multidimensional dataset combining visual, spectral, and structural information that enables new approaches for precision grazing management through machine learning.

Conclusion: The dataset is publicly available via a Kaggle competition to advance pasture biomass estimation using machine learning techniques.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of pasture biomass is important for decision-making in
livestock production systems. Estimates of pasture biomass can be used to
manage stocking rates to maximise pasture utilisation, while minimising the
risk of overgrazing and promoting overall system health. We present a
comprehensive dataset of 1,162 annotated top-view images of pastures collected
across 19 locations in Australia. The images were taken across multiple seasons
and include a range of temperate pasture species. Each image captures a 70cm *
30cm quadrat and is paired with on-ground measurements including biomass sorted
by component (green, dead, and legume fraction), vegetation height, and
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Active Optical Sensors
(AOS). The multidimensional nature of the data, which combines visual,
spectral, and structural information, opens up new possibilities for advancing
the use of precision grazing management. The dataset is released and hosted in
a Kaggle competition that challenges the international Machine Learning
community with the task of pasture biomass estimation. The dataset is available

### [141] [Gen-LangSplat: Generalized Language Gaussian Splatting with Pre-Trained Feature Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22930)
*Pranav Saxena*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gen-LangSplat eliminates the need for scene-specific language autoencoders in 3D language fields by using a pre-trained generalized autoencoder, achieving comparable performance with better efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods like LangSplat require costly per-scene autoencoder training, creating a scalability bottleneck for deploying open-vocabulary 3D language fields.

Method: Replace scene-specific autoencoders with a generalized autoencoder pre-trained on ScanNet dataset, using fixed latent space for all scenes without additional training.

Result: Achieves efficiency boost while maintaining or exceeding LangSplat's querying performance, with optimal latent dimensions validated through ablation studies.

Conclusion: Generalized embeddings enable scalable, real-time interactive 3D AI applications by removing scene-specific training requirements while preserving accuracy.

Abstract: Modeling open-vocabulary language fields in 3D is essential for intuitive
human-AI interaction and querying within physical environments.
State-of-the-art approaches, such as LangSplat, leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting
to efficiently construct these language fields, encoding features distilled
from high-dimensional models like CLIP. However, this efficiency is currently
offset by the requirement to train a scene-specific language autoencoder for
feature compression, introducing a costly, per-scene optimization bottleneck
that hinders deployment scalability. In this work, we introduce Gen-LangSplat,
that eliminates this requirement by replacing the scene-wise autoencoder with a
generalized autoencoder, pre-trained extensively on the large-scale ScanNet
dataset. This architectural shift enables the use of a fixed, compact latent
space for language features across any new scene without any scene-specific
training. By removing this dependency, our entire language field construction
process achieves a efficiency boost while delivering querying performance
comparable to, or exceeding, the original LangSplat method. To validate our
design choice, we perform a thorough ablation study empirically determining the
optimal latent embedding dimension and quantifying representational fidelity
using Mean Squared Error and cosine similarity between the original and
reprojected 512-dimensional CLIP embeddings. Our results demonstrate that
generalized embeddings can efficiently and accurately support open-vocabulary
querying in novel 3D scenes, paving the way for scalable, real-time interactive
3D AI applications.

### [142] [Positional Preservation Embedding for Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22936)
*Mouxiao Huang,Borui Jiang,Dehua Zheng,Hailin Hu,Kai Han,Xinghao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PPE (Positional Preservation Embedding) is a parameter-free token compression method that preserves spatiotemporal structure by encoding 3D positions, enabling efficient multimodal language models without disrupting spatial layouts or temporal continuity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token merging methods reduce sequence length but disrupt spatial layouts and temporal continuity by ignoring positional relationships, leading to inefficiencies in multimodal large language models.

Method: PPE introduces disentangled encoding of 3D positions in the token dimension, allowing compressed tokens to encapsulate multiple original positions. It supports cascade clustering for progressive token compression without parameter adjustments.

Result: Applied to state-of-the-art token merging frameworks, PPE achieves consistent 2%-5% improvements across multiple vision-language benchmarks including MMBench, TextVQA, and VideoMME.

Conclusion: Preserving positional cues is critical for efficient and effective MLLM reasoning, and PPE provides a generic solution that can be seamlessly integrated into existing token merging methods.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
vision-language tasks, yet often suffer from inefficiencies due to redundant
visual tokens. Existing token merging methods reduce sequence length but
frequently disrupt spatial layouts and temporal continuity by disregarding
positional relationships. In this work, we propose a novel encoding operator
dubbed as \textbf{P}ositional \textbf{P}reservation \textbf{E}mbedding
(\textbf{PPE}), which has the main hallmark of preservation of spatiotemporal
structure during visual token compression. PPE explicitly introduces the
disentangled encoding of 3D positions in the token dimension, enabling each
compressed token to encapsulate different positions from multiple original
tokens. Furthermore, we show that PPE can effectively support cascade
clustering -- a progressive token compression strategy that leads to better
performance retention. PPE is a parameter-free and generic operator that can be
seamlessly integrated into existing token merging methods without any
adjustments. Applied to state-of-the-art token merging framework, PPE achieves
consistent improvements of $2\%\sim5\%$ across multiple vision-language
benchmarks, including MMBench (general vision understanding), TextVQA (layout
understanding) and VideoMME (temporal understanding). These results demonstrate
that preserving positional cues is critical for efficient and effective MLLM
reasoning.

*Matthew So,Judah Goldfeder,Mark Lis,Hod Lipson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper challenges the assumption that biometrics are statistically uncorrelated by showing that left and right irises of individuals are correlated (91 ROC AUC), and confirms fingerprint intra-subject correlations, while cross-modal fingerprint-to-iris matching remains near chance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the historic assumption that biometrics of an individual are statistically uncorrelated, specifically examining correlations between left/right irises and fingerprints.

Method: Used Bi-Encoder networks with ResNet-50 and Vision Transformer backbones trained on three verification tasks: fingerprint-to-fingerprint matching, iris-to-iris matching, and cross-modal fingerprint-to-iris matching using 274 subjects with ~100k fingerprints and 7k iris images.

Result: Iris-to-iris matching achieved 91 ROC AUC, showing clear correlation between left and right irises. Fingerprint models confirmed positive intra-subject correlations. Cross-modal matching performed only slightly above chance.

Conclusion: The findings challenge independence assumptions of biometrics, with iris correlations clearly demonstrated. More data and sophisticated pipelines are needed for compelling cross-modal results. Vision Transformers were successfully applied to this matching task for the first time.

Abstract: There has been a historic assumption that the biometrics of an individual are
statistically uncorrelated. We test this assumption by training Bi-Encoder
networks on three verification tasks, including fingerprint-to-fingerprint
matching, iris-to-iris matching, and cross-modal fingerprint-to-iris matching
using 274 subjects with $\sim$100k fingerprints and 7k iris images. We trained
ResNet-50 and Vision Transformer backbones in Bi-Encoder architectures such
that the contrastive loss between images sampled from the same individual is
minimized. The iris ResNet architecture reaches 91 ROC AUC score for
iris-to-iris matching, providing clear evidence that the left and right irises
of an individual are correlated. Fingerprint models reproduce the positive
intra-subject suggested by prior work in this space. This is the first work
attempting to use Vision Transformers for this matching. Cross-modal matching
rises only slightly above chance, which suggests that more data and a more
sophisticated pipeline is needed to obtain compelling results. These findings
continue challenge independence assumptions of biometrics and we plan to extend
this work to other biometrics in the future. Code available:

### [144] [Switchable Token-Specific Codebook Quantization For Face Image Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22943)
*Yongbo Wang,Haonan Wang,Guodong Mu,Ruixin Zhang,Jiaqi Chen,Jingyun Zhang,Jun Wang,Yuan Xie,Zhizhong Zhang,Shouhong Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Switchable Token-Specific Codebook Quantization for face image compression, using category-specific codebook groups and token-specific codebooks to improve performance at low bit rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global codebook strategies for face image compression overlook category-specific correlations and semantic token differences, leading to suboptimal performance especially at low bpp.

Method: Learns distinct codebook groups for different image categories and assigns independent codebooks to each token, recording codebook group membership with minimal bits to enable more codebooks under lower bpp.

Result: Achieves 93.51% average accuracy for reconstructed face images at 0.05 bpp on face recognition datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances expressive capability and reconstruction performance for face image compression, and can be integrated into existing codebook-based approaches.

Abstract: With the ever-increasing volume of visual data, the efficient and lossless
transmission, along with its subsequent interpretation and understanding, has
become a critical bottleneck in modern information systems. The emerged
codebook-based solution utilize a globally shared codebook to quantize and
dequantize each token, controlling the bpp by adjusting the number of tokens or
the codebook size. However, for facial images, which are rich in attributes,
such global codebook strategies overlook both the category-specific
correlations within images and the semantic differences among tokens, resulting
in suboptimal performance, especially at low bpp. Motivated by these
observations, we propose a Switchable Token-Specific Codebook Quantization for
face image compression, which learns distinct codebook groups for different
image categories and assigns an independent codebook to each token. By
recording the codebook group to which each token belongs with a small number of
bits, our method can reduce the loss incurred when decreasing the size of each
codebook group. This enables a larger total number of codebooks under a lower
overall bpp, thereby enhancing the expressive capability and improving
reconstruction performance. Owing to its generalizable design, our method can
be integrated into any existing codebook-based representation learning approach
and has demonstrated its effectiveness on face recognition datasets, achieving
an average accuracy of 93.51% for reconstructed images at 0.05 bpp.

*Zeyu Wang,Zilong Chen,Chenhui Gou,Feng Li,Chaorui Deng,Deyao Zhu,Kunchang Li,Weihao Yu,Haoqin Tu,Haoqi Fan,Cihang Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents an efficient approach to build unified multimodal models by strategically fusing existing specialized models rather than training from scratch, achieving competitive performance with significantly reduced computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unified multimodal models require substantial computational resources by training from scratch, despite showing remarkable capabilities. The authors aim to develop a more efficient approach that leverages existing specialized models.

Method: The key design is to retain original model blocks while interleaving multimodal self-attention blocks throughout the networks. This double fusion mechanism preserves original model strengths while enabling rich multimodal fusion and synergistic combination of high-level semantic representations with low-level spatial signals.

Result: The approach achieves strong results with only ~35B training tokens: 0.91 on GenEval for compositional text-to-image generation, 82.16 on DPG-Bench for complex text-to-image generation, 6.06 on GEditBench, and 3.77 on ImgEdit-Bench for image editing.

Conclusion: Competitive multimodal performance can be obtained efficiently by strategically fusing publicly available specialized models, and the authors release their entire code, model weights, and datasets to support future research in unified multimodal modeling.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have recently shown remarkable gains in both
capability and versatility, yet most leading systems are still trained from
scratch and require substantial computational resources. In this paper, we show
that competitive performance can be obtained far more efficiently by
strategically fusing publicly available models specialized for either
generation or understanding. Our key design is to retain the original blocks
while additionally interleaving multimodal self-attention blocks throughout the
networks. This double fusion mechanism (1) effectively enables rich multi-modal
fusion while largely preserving the original strengths of the base models, and
(2) catalyzes synergistic fusion of high-level semantic representations from
the understanding encoder with low-level spatial signals from the generation
encoder. By training with only ~ 35B tokens, this approach achieves strong
results across multiple benchmarks: 0.91 on GenEval for compositional
text-to-image generation, 82.16 on DPG-Bench for complex text-to-image
generation, 6.06 on GEditBench, and 3.77 on ImgEdit-Bench for image editing. By
fully releasing the entire suite of code, model weights, and datasets, we hope
to support future research on unified multimodal modeling.

### [146] [FAME: Fairness-aware Attention-modulated Video Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22960)
*Zhangkai Wu,Xuhui Fan,Zhongyuan Xie,Kaize Shi,Zhidong Li,Longbing Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FAME is a fairness-aware video editing method that mitigates profession-related gender biases while maintaining prompt alignment and temporal consistency through attention modulation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training-free video editing models tend to reinforce gender stereotypes when rendering profession-related prompts, creating biased outputs that don't fairly represent gender diversity in various professions.

Method: FAME uses fairness embeddings from minority representations by injecting debiasing tokens into the text encoder. It integrates fairness modulation into temporal self-attention (with region-constrained masks and time decay weighting) and cross-attention (with fairness-sensitive similarity masks) to prevent motion corruption and temporal inconsistency.

Result: Extensive experiments on the FairVE benchmark show that FAME achieves stronger fairness alignment and semantic fidelity compared to existing video editing baselines, effectively reducing gender biases while maintaining video quality.

Conclusion: FAME successfully mitigates profession-related gender biases in video editing through attention modulation techniques that preserve prompt alignment and temporal consistency, demonstrating improved fairness without compromising video quality.

Abstract: Training-free video editing (VE) models tend to fall back on gender
stereotypes when rendering profession-related prompts. We propose \textbf{FAME}
for \textit{Fairness-aware Attention-modulated Video Editing} that mitigates
profession-related gender biases while preserving prompt alignment and temporal
consistency for coherent VE. We derive fairness embeddings from existing
minority representations by softly injecting debiasing tokens into the text
encoder. Simultaneously, FAME integrates fairness modulation into both temporal
self attention and prompt-to-region cross attention to mitigate the motion
corruption and temporal inconsistency caused by directly introducing fairness
cues. For temporal self attention, FAME introduces a region constrained
attention mask combined with time decay weighting, which enhances intra-region
coherence while suppressing irrelevant inter-region interactions. For cross
attention, it reweights tokens to region matching scores by incorporating
fairness sensitive similarity masks derived from debiasing prompt embeddings.
Together, these modulations keep fairness-sensitive semantics tied to the right
visual regions and prevent temporal drift across frames. Extensive experiments
on new VE fairness-oriented benchmark \textit{FairVE} demonstrate that FAME
achieves stronger fairness alignment and semantic fidelity, surpassing existing
VE baselines.

*Zhangkai Wu,Xuhui Fan,Zhongyuan Xie,Kaize Shi,Longbing Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VALA is a variational alignment module that adaptively selects key frames and compresses latent features into semantic anchors for consistent video editing, improving temporal consistency without manual frame selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training-free video editing methods rely on heuristic frame selection for DDIM inversion, which introduces manual bias and reduces scalability of end-to-end inference.

Method: VALA uses a variational alignment module with contrastive learning to adaptively select key frames and compress their latent features into semantic anchors, transforming cross-frame representations while preserving content and temporal coherence.

Result: Extensive experiments show VALA achieves state-of-the-art performance in inversion fidelity, editing quality, and temporal consistency, with improved efficiency over prior methods.

Conclusion: VALA provides an effective variational framework for adaptive key frame selection and latent compression that can be fully integrated into training-free text-to-image based video editing models.

Abstract: Recent advances in training-free video editing have enabled lightweight and
precise cross-frame generation by leveraging pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models. However, existing methods often rely on heuristic frame
selection to maintain temporal consistency during DDIM inversion, which
introduces manual bias and reduces the scalability of end-to-end inference. In
this paper, we propose~\textbf{VALA} (\textbf{V}ariational \textbf{A}lignment
for \textbf{L}atent \textbf{A}nchors), a variational alignment module that
adaptively selects key frames and compresses their latent features into
semantic anchors for consistent video editing. To learn meaningful assignments,
VALA propose a variational framework with a contrastive learning objective.
Therefore, it can transform cross-frame latent representations into compressed
latent anchors that preserve both content and temporal coherence. Our method
can be fully integrated into training-free text-to-image based video editing
models. Extensive experiments on real-world video editing benchmarks show that
VALA achieves state-of-the-art performance in inversion fidelity, editing
quality, and temporal consistency, while offering improved efficiency over
prior methods.

Abstract: Driving scene generation is a critical domain for autonomous driving,
enabling downstream applications, including perception and planning evaluation.
Occupancy-centric methods have recently achieved state-of-the-art results by
offering consistent conditioning across frames and modalities; however, their
performance heavily depends on annotated occupancy data, which still remains
scarce. To overcome this limitation, we curate Nuplan-Occ, the largest semantic
occupancy dataset to date, constructed from the widely used Nuplan benchmark.
Its scale and diversity facilitate not only large-scale generative modeling but
also autonomous driving downstream applications. Based on this dataset, we
develop a unified framework that jointly synthesizes high-quality semantic
occupancy, multi-view videos, and LiDAR point clouds. Our approach incorporates
a spatio-temporal disentangled architecture to support high-fidelity spatial
expansion and temporal forecasting of 4D dynamic occupancy. To bridge modal
gaps, we further propose two novel techniques: a Gaussian splatting-based
sparse point map rendering strategy that enhances multi-view video generation,
and a sensor-aware embedding strategy that explicitly models LiDAR sensor
properties for realistic multi-LiDAR simulation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves superior generation fidelity and
scalability compared to existing approaches, and validates its practical value
in downstream tasks. Repo:

### [150] [VoMP: Predicting Volumetric Mechanical Property Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22975)
*Rishit Dagli,Donglai Xiang,Vismay Modi,Charles Loop,Clement Fuji Tsang,Anka He Chen,Anita Hu,Gavriel State,David I. W. Levin,Maria Shugrina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VoMP is a feed-forward method that predicts spatially-varying mechanical properties (Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, density) for 3D objects using multi-view features and a Geometry Transformer, trained on real-world materials data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physical simulation requires spatially-varying mechanical properties that are typically laboriously hand-crafted, creating a need for automated prediction methods.

Method: VoMP aggregates per-voxel multi-view features and uses a trained Geometry Transformer to predict per-voxel material latent codes on a physically plausible manifold, with training data from segmented 3D datasets, material databases, and vision-language models.

Result: VoMP estimates accurate volumetric properties and far outperforms prior art in both accuracy and speed.

Conclusion: The method successfully automates the prediction of spatially-varying mechanical properties for 3D objects, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Physical simulation relies on spatially-varying mechanical properties, often
laboriously hand-crafted. VoMP is a feed-forward method trained to predict
Young's modulus ($E$), Poisson's ratio ($\nu$), and density ($\rho$) throughout
the volume of 3D objects, in any representation that can be rendered and
voxelized. VoMP aggregates per-voxel multi-view features and passes them to our
trained Geometry Transformer to predict per-voxel material latent codes. These
latents reside on a manifold of physically plausible materials, which we learn
from a real-world dataset, guaranteeing the validity of decoded per-voxel
materials. To obtain object-level training data, we propose an annotation
pipeline combining knowledge from segmented 3D datasets, material databases,
and a vision-language model, along with a new benchmark. Experiments show that
VoMP estimates accurate volumetric properties, far outperforming prior art in
accuracy and speed.

TL;DR: SceneDecorator is a training-free framework for scene-oriented story generation that addresses scene planning and scene consistency challenges through VLM-Guided Scene Planning and Long-Term Scene-Sharing Attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with maintaining concept consistency across images and overlook the crucial role of scenes in storytelling, restricting creativity in practice.

Method: Proposes SceneDecorator with VLM-Guided Scene Planning for narrative coherence across scenes in a global-to-local manner, and Long-Term Scene-Sharing Attention for maintaining long-term scene consistency and subject diversity.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance of SceneDecorator in maintaining scene consistency and narrative coherence across generated stories.

Conclusion: SceneDecorator has potential to unleash creativity in arts, films, and games by addressing key challenges in scene-oriented story generation.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image models have revolutionized image generation, but they
still struggle with maintaining concept consistency across generated images.
While existing works focus on character consistency, they often overlook the
crucial role of scenes in storytelling, which restricts their creativity in
practice. This paper introduces scene-oriented story generation, addressing two
key challenges: (i) scene planning, where current methods fail to ensure
scene-level narrative coherence by relying solely on text descriptions, and
(ii) scene consistency, which remains largely unexplored in terms of
maintaining scene consistency across multiple stories. We propose
SceneDecorator, a training-free framework that employs VLM-Guided Scene
Planning to ensure narrative coherence across different scenes in a
``global-to-local'' manner, and Long-Term Scene-Sharing Attention to maintain
long-term scene consistency and subject diversity across generated stories.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of SceneDecorator,
highlighting its potential to unleash creativity in the fields of arts, films,
and games.

### [152] [LoMix: Learnable Weighted Multi-Scale Logits Mixing for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22995)
*Md Mostafijur Rahman,Radu Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoMix is a NAS-inspired module that learns to optimally fuse multi-scale logits in U-shaped networks through differentiable mixing operations and adaptive loss weighting, improving segmentation performance without inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current U-shaped networks treat multi-scale logits in isolation, missing the complementary benefits of fusing coarse context with fine details, which limits segmentation performance.

Method: LoMix uses four lightweight fusion operators (addition, multiplication, concatenation, attention) to create mixed-scale outputs and learns optimal loss weights for each output through co-optimization with network parameters.

Result: On Synapse 8-organ dataset, LoMix improves DICE by +4.2% over single-output supervision and +2.2% over deep supervision, with advantages growing to +9.23% in data-scarce scenarios. Across four benchmarks, improvements reach up to +13.5%.

Conclusion: Learnable weighted mixed-scale fusion generalizes broadly across U-shaped networks, providing data-efficient performance gains while remaining interpretable and overhead-free at inference.

Abstract: U-shaped networks output logits at multiple spatial scales, each capturing a
different blend of coarse context and fine detail. Yet, training still treats
these logits in isolation - either supervising only the final,
highest-resolution logits or applying deep supervision with identical loss
weights at every scale - without exploring mixed-scale combinations.
Consequently, the decoder output misses the complementary cues that arise only
when coarse and fine predictions are fused. To address this issue, we introduce
LoMix (Logits Mixing), a NAS-inspired, differentiable plug-and-play module that
generates new mixed-scale outputs and learns how exactly each of them should
guide the training process. More precisely, LoMix mixes the multi-scale decoder
logits with four lightweight fusion operators: addition, multiplication,
concatenation, and attention-based weighted fusion, yielding a rich set of
synthetic mutant maps. Every original or mutant map is given a softplus loss
weight that is co-optimized with network parameters, mimicking a one-step
architecture search that automatically discovers the most useful scales,
mixtures, and operators. Plugging LoMix into recent U-shaped architectures
(i.e., PVT-V2-B2 backbone with EMCAD decoder) on Synapse 8-organ dataset
improves DICE by +4.2% over single-output supervision, +2.2% over deep
supervision, and +1.5% over equally weighted additive fusion, all with zero
inference overhead. When training data are scarce (e.g., one or two labeled
scans), the advantage grows to +9.23%, underscoring LoMix's data efficiency.
Across four benchmarks and diverse U-shaped networks, LoMiX improves DICE by up
to +13.5% over single-output supervision, confirming that learnable weighted
mixed-scale fusion generalizes broadly while remaining data efficient, fully
interpretable, and overhead-free at inference. Our code is available at

### [153] [CoMo: Compositional Motion Customization for Text-to-Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23007)
*Youcan Xu,Zhen Wang,Jiaxin Shi,Kexin Li,Feifei Shao,Jun Xiao,Yi Yang,Jun Yu,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoMo is a framework for compositional motion customization in text-to-video generation that enables multiple distinct motions in a single video, addressing motion-appearance entanglement and multi-motion blending challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video models struggle with precise motion control for complex multi-subject motions, and existing single-motion customization methods fail in compositional scenarios due to motion-appearance entanglement and ineffective multi-motion blending.

Method: Two-phase approach: (1) Single-motion learning phase using static-dynamic decoupled tuning to disentangle motion from appearance and learn motion-specific modules; (2) Multi-motion composition phase using plug-and-play divide-and-merge strategy to spatially isolate motion influences during denoising without additional training.

Result: Extensive experiments show CoMo achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly advancing controllable video generation capabilities. A new benchmark and evaluation metric were introduced to assess multi-motion fidelity and blending.

Conclusion: CoMo successfully addresses the challenges of compositional motion customization, enabling synthesis of multiple distinct motions in a single video and advancing the field of controllable video generation.

Abstract: While recent text-to-video models excel at generating diverse scenes, they
struggle with precise motion control, particularly for complex, multi-subject
motions. Although methods for single-motion customization have been developed
to address this gap, they fail in compositional scenarios due to two primary
challenges: motion-appearance entanglement and ineffective multi-motion
blending. This paper introduces CoMo, a novel framework for
$\textbf{compositional motion customization}$ in text-to-video generation,
enabling the synthesis of multiple, distinct motions within a single video.
CoMo addresses these issues through a two-phase approach. First, in the
single-motion learning phase, a static-dynamic decoupled tuning paradigm
disentangles motion from appearance to learn a motion-specific module. Second,
in the multi-motion composition phase, a plug-and-play divide-and-merge
strategy composes these learned motions without additional training by
spatially isolating their influence during the denoising process. To facilitate
research in this new domain, we also introduce a new benchmark and a novel
evaluation metric designed to assess multi-motion fidelity and blending.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoMo achieves state-of-the-art
performance, significantly advancing the capabilities of controllable video
generation. Our project page is at https://como6.github.io/.

*Pan Zhao,Hui Yuan,Chongzhen Tian,Tian Guo,Raouf Hamzaoui,Zhigeng Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UGAE framework enhances compressed point clouds through geometry and attribute enhancement components, achieving significant quality improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lossy compression of point clouds causes irreversible distortion in geometry and attributes, requiring enhancement methods to improve quality.

Method: Three-component framework: PoGE uses Transformer-based sparse convolutional U-Net for geometry reconstruction; PAE employs geometry-guided recoloring with DA-KNN; PoAE uses attribute residual prediction with W-MSE loss.

Result: Outperformed existing methods on 8iVFB, Owlii, and MVUB datasets with 9.98 dB BD-PSNR gain and 90.98% bitrate savings for geometry, plus 3.67 dB BD-PSNR improvement and 56.88% bitrate savings for attributes.

Conclusion: UGAE significantly enhances both geometry and attribute quality of compressed point clouds while achieving substantial bitrate savings and improved perceptual quality.

Abstract: Lossy compression of point clouds reduces storage and transmission costs;
however, it inevitably leads to irreversible distortion in geometry structure
and attribute information. To address these issues, we propose a unified
geometry and attribute enhancement (UGAE) framework, which consists of three
core components: post-geometry enhancement (PoGE), pre-attribute enhancement
(PAE), and post-attribute enhancement (PoAE). In PoGE, a Transformer-based
sparse convolutional U-Net is used to reconstruct the geometry structure with
high precision by predicting voxel occupancy probabilities. Building on the
refined geometry structure, PAE introduces an innovative enhanced
geometry-guided recoloring strategy, which uses a detail-aware K-Nearest
Neighbors (DA-KNN) method to achieve accurate recoloring and effectively
preserve high-frequency details before attribute compression. Finally, at the
decoder side, PoAE uses an attribute residual prediction network with a
weighted mean squared error (W-MSE) loss to enhance the quality of
high-frequency regions while maintaining the fidelity of low-frequency regions.
UGAE significantly outperformed existing methods on three benchmark datasets:
8iVFB, Owlii, and MVUB. Compared to the latest G-PCC test model (TMC13v29),
UGAE achieved an average BD-PSNR gain of 9.98 dB and 90.98% BD-bitrate savings
for geometry under the D1 metric, as well as a 3.67 dB BD-PSNR improvement with
56.88% BD-bitrate savings for attributes on the Y component. Additionally, it
improved perceptual quality significantly.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces M³T2IBench, a challenging benchmark for evaluating text-to-image models, and proposes a training-free post-editing method called Revise-Then-Enforce to improve image-text alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image model evaluations either address overly simple scenarios or use metrics that don't correlate well with human evaluation, particularly failing to handle complex prompts with multiple instances of the same category.

Method: The authors created M³T2IBench (large-scale, multi-category, multi-instance, multi-relation benchmark) with an object-detection-based evaluation metric called AlignScore, and proposed the Revise-Then-Enforce approach - a training-free post-editing method to enhance image-text alignment.

Result: Current open-source text-to-image models perform poorly on the challenging M³T2IBench benchmark. The proposed Revise-Then-Enforce method demonstrates improvements in image-text alignment across various diffusion models.

Conclusion: The paper presents a more comprehensive evaluation framework for text-to-image models and offers an effective post-editing solution to address alignment issues, highlighting the limitations of current models in handling complex multi-instance scenarios.

Abstract: Text-to-image models are known to struggle with generating images that
perfectly align with textual prompts. Several previous studies have focused on
evaluating image-text alignment in text-to-image generation. However, these
evaluations either address overly simple scenarios, especially overlooking the
difficulty of prompts with multiple different instances belonging to the same
category, or they introduce metrics that do not correlate well with human
evaluation. In this study, we introduce M$^3$T2IBench, a large-scale,
multi-category, multi-instance, multi-relation along with an
object-detection-based evaluation metric, $AlignScore$, which aligns closely
with human evaluation. Our findings reveal that current open-source
text-to-image models perform poorly on this challenging benchmark.
Additionally, we propose the Revise-Then-Enforce approach to enhance image-text
alignment. This training-free post-editing method demonstrates improvements in
image-text alignment across a broad range of diffusion models. \footnote{Our
code and data has been released in supplementary material and will be made

Method: Developed UniAIDet benchmark that includes both photographic and artistic images, covering text-to-image, image-to-image, image inpainting, image editing, and deepfake models.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation of various detection methods was conducted, answering key research questions about generalization capability and the relation between detection and localization.

Conclusion: UniAIDet provides a robust foundation for future research in AI-generated image detection by addressing coverage gaps in existing benchmarks.

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of image generative models, the authenticity of
digital images has become a significant concern. While existing studies have
proposed various methods for detecting AI-generated content, current benchmarks
are limited in their coverage of diverse generative models and image
categories, often overlooking end-to-end image editing and artistic images. To
address these limitations, we introduce UniAIDet, a unified and comprehensive
benchmark that includes both photographic and artistic images. UniAIDet covers
a wide range of generative models, including text-to-image, image-to-image,
image inpainting, image editing, and deepfake models. Using UniAIDet, we
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of various detection methods and answer
three key research questions regarding generalization capability and the
relation between detection and localization. Our benchmark and analysis provide
a robust foundation for future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NestAR is a nested autoregressive model that uses hierarchical multi-scale modules to reduce computational complexity from O(n) to O(log n) while improving image diversity, achieving competitive performance with lower cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AutoRegressive models are computationally intensive and existing solutions like VAR often lead to limited sample diversity in image generation.

Method: Proposes nested AR architecture with multi-scale modules in hierarchical order, where larger-scale modules are conditioned on smaller-scale ones. Uses flow matching loss for continuous tokens and develops coordination objectives for multi-scale training.

Result: Achieves competitive image generation performance while significantly lowering computational cost, with improved image diversity compared to existing AR models.

Conclusion: NestAR provides an efficient nested autoregressive approach that reduces computational complexity and enhances diversity in image generation, making AR models more practical for large-scale applications.

Abstract: AutoRegressive (AR) models have demonstrated competitive performance in image
generation, achieving results comparable to those of diffusion models. However,
their token-by-token image generation mechanism remains computationally
intensive and existing solutions such as VAR often lead to limited sample
diversity. In this work, we propose a Nested AutoRegressive~(NestAR) model,
which proposes nested AutoRegressive architectures in generating images. NestAR
designs multi-scale modules in a hierarchical order. These different scaled
modules are constructed in an AR architecture, where one larger-scale module is
conditioned on outputs from its previous smaller-scale module. Within each
module, NestAR uses another AR structure to generate ``patches'' of tokens. The
proposed nested AR architecture reduces the overall complexity from
$\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ in generating $n$ image tokens, as
well as increases image diversities. NestAR further incorporates flow matching
loss to use continuous tokens, and develops objectives to coordinate these
multi-scale modules in model training. NestAR achieves competitive image
generation performance while significantly lowering computational cost.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HieraMamba is a hierarchical architecture for video temporal grounding that uses Mamba's selective scanning to preserve temporal structure across scales, achieving state-of-the-art performance on long untrimmed videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for video temporal grounding often compromise temporal fidelity in long videos through over-downsampling or fixed windows, failing to capture both global context and fine-grained temporal details needed for precise localization.

Method: Uses hierarchical architecture with Anchor-MambaPooling (AMP) blocks that leverage Mamba's selective scanning to create compact anchor tokens summarizing video content at multiple granularities, combined with anchor-conditioned and segment-pooled contrastive losses.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art performance on Ego4D-NLQ, MAD, and TACoS benchmarks, demonstrating precise and temporally faithful localization in long, untrimmed videos.

Conclusion: HieraMamba effectively addresses the challenge of preserving temporal structure while capturing semantic richness across scales, enabling superior performance in video temporal grounding tasks for long videos.

Abstract: Video temporal grounding, the task of localizing the start and end times of a
natural language query in untrimmed video, requires capturing both global
context and fine-grained temporal detail. This challenge is particularly
pronounced in long videos, where existing methods often compromise temporal
fidelity by over-downsampling or relying on fixed windows. We present
HieraMamba, a hierarchical architecture that preserves temporal structure and
semantic richness across scales. At its core are Anchor-MambaPooling (AMP)
blocks, which utilize Mamba's selective scanning to produce compact anchor
tokens that summarize video content at multiple granularities. Two
complementary objectives, anchor-conditioned and segment-pooled contrastive
losses, encourage anchors to retain local detail while remaining globally
discriminative. HieraMamba sets a new state-of-the-art on Ego4D-NLQ, MAD, and
TACoS, demonstrating precise, temporally faithful localization in long,
untrimmed videos.

*Joel Honkamaa,Pekka Marttinen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using MIND feature space transformation and ensembling to improve robustness of deep learning-based deformable registration for brain images, addressing generalization issues across different contrasts and modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning deformable registration methods often generalize poorly beyond their training data distribution, which limits their practical usability in clinical settings with varying imaging contrasts and modalities.

Method: Transform images into MIND feature space before feeding to the model, and use a special ensembling strategy to improve registration robustness.

Result: The approach significantly improves robustness of registration performance on contrasts and modalities different from the training set, with ensembling providing small but consistent improvements.

Conclusion: Simple preprocessing with MIND feature space transformation combined with ensembling can substantially enhance the generalization capability of deep learning-based deformable registration methods across different imaging conditions.

Abstract: Deep learning based deformable registration methods have become popular in
recent years. However, their ability to generalize beyond training data
distribution can be poor, significantly hindering their usability. LUMIR brain
registration challenge for Learn2Reg 2025 aims to advance the field by
evaluating the performance of the registration on contrasts and modalities
different from those included in the training set. Here we describe our
submission to the challenge, which proposes a very simple idea for
significantly improving robustness by transforming the images into MIND feature
space before feeding them into the model. In addition, a special ensembling
strategy is proposed that shows a small but consistent improvement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Progressive Growing of Patch Size is a curriculum learning method that gradually increases patch size during 3D medical image segmentation training, improving class balance and accelerating convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address class imbalance issues in 3D medical image segmentation and improve training efficiency by developing an automatic curriculum learning approach.

Method: Progressively increases patch size during model training in two modes: resource-efficient mode and performance mode, evaluated across 15 diverse 3D medical image segmentation tasks.

Result: Resource-efficient mode reduces training time to 44% while matching baseline performance; performance mode achieves 1.28% relative mean Dice Score improvement with 89% training time, particularly effective for imbalanced tasks like lesion segmentation.

Conclusion: The progressive patch size curriculum is a simple yet effective strategy that consistently improves both segmentation performance and training efficiency across diverse architectures (UNet, UNETR, SwinUNETR), reducing performance variance and enabling more trustworthy model comparisons.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Progressive Growing of Patch Size, an automatic
curriculum learning approach for 3D medical image segmentation. Our approach
progressively increases the patch size during model training, resulting in an
improved class balance for smaller patch sizes and accelerated convergence of
the training process. We evaluate our curriculum approach in two settings: a
resource-efficient mode and a performance mode, both regarding Dice score
performance and computational costs across 15 diverse and popular 3D medical
image segmentation tasks. The resource-efficient mode matches the Dice score
performance of the conventional constant patch size sampling baseline with a
notable reduction in training time to only 44%. The performance mode improves
upon constant patch size segmentation results, achieving a statistically
significant relative mean performance gain of 1.28% in Dice Score. Remarkably,
across all 15 tasks, our proposed performance mode manages to surpass the
constant patch size baseline in Dice Score performance, while simultaneously
reducing training time to only 89%. The benefits are particularly pronounced
for highly imbalanced tasks such as lesion segmentation tasks. Rigorous
experiments demonstrate that our performance mode not only improves mean
segmentation performance but also reduces performance variance, yielding more
trustworthy model comparison. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the
proposed curriculum sampling is not tied to a specific architecture but
represents a broadly applicable strategy that consistently boosts performance
across diverse segmentation models, including UNet, UNETR, and SwinUNETR. In
summary, we show that this simple yet elegant transformation on input data
substantially improves both Dice Score performance and training runtime, while
being compatible across diverse segmentation backbones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There has been little systematic investigation into multimodal position encoding despite its importance for vision-language models, prompting a comprehensive analysis of multimodal RoPE's core components.

Method: The authors analyze multimodal RoPE's position design and frequency allocation, then propose MHRoPE and MRoPE-I - two simple plug-and-play variants that require no architectural changes.

Result: The proposed methods consistently outperform existing approaches across diverse benchmarks, showing significant improvements in both general and fine-grained multimodal understanding.

Conclusion: Three key guidelines (positional coherence, full frequency utilization, and preservation of textual priors) ensure effective multimodal position encoding, and the proposed methods successfully implement these principles.

Abstract: Multimodal position encoding is essential for vision-language models, yet
there has been little systematic investigation into multimodal position
encoding. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of multimodal Rotary Positional
Embedding (RoPE) by examining its two core components: position design and
frequency allocation. Through extensive experiments, we identify three key
guidelines: positional coherence, full frequency utilization, and preservation
of textual priors-ensuring unambiguous layout, rich representation, and
faithful transfer from the pre-trained LLM. Based on these insights, we propose
Multi-Head RoPE (MHRoPE) and MRoPE-Interleave (MRoPE-I), two simple and
plug-and-play variants that require no architectural changes. Our methods
consistently outperform existing approaches across diverse benchmarks, with
significant improvements in both general and fine-grained multimodal

*Hebaixu Wang,Jing Zhang,Haoyang Chen,Haonan Guo,Di Wang,Jiayi Ma,Bo Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RDBM is a unified diffusion bridge model that uses residual-based modulation for adaptive image restoration, preserving undegraded regions while restoring degraded areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion bridge models lack unified analysis and indiscriminately reconstruct images, distorting undegraded regions due to imperfect reconstruction.

Method: Theoretical reformulation of stochastic differential equations for generalized diffusion bridge, with residual-based modulation of noise injection/removal for adaptive restoration.

Result: State-of-the-art performance across diverse image restoration tasks, with empirical demonstration of optimality and comprehensive experimental validation.

Conclusion: RDBM provides a unified framework that subsumes existing bridge models as special cases, enabling adaptive restoration while preserving intact regions.

Abstract: Diffusion bridge models establish probabilistic paths between arbitrary
paired distributions and exhibit great potential for universal image
restoration. Most existing methods merely treat them as simple variants of
stochastic interpolants, lacking a unified analytical perspective. Besides,
they indiscriminately reconstruct images through global noise injection and
removal, inevitably distorting undegraded regions due to imperfect
reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose the Residual Diffusion
Bridge Model (RDBM). Specifically, we theoretically reformulate the stochastic
differential equations of generalized diffusion bridge and derive the
analytical formulas of its forward and reverse processes. Crucially, we
leverage the residuals from given distributions to modulate the noise injection
and removal, enabling adaptive restoration of degraded regions while preserving
intact others. Moreover, we unravel the fundamental mathematical essence of
existing bridge models, all of which are special cases of RDBM and empirically
demonstrate the optimality of our proposed models. Extensive experiments are
conducted to demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method both
qualitatively and quantitatively across diverse image restoration tasks. Code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReconViaGen integrates reconstruction priors into diffusion-based 3D generation to address incompleteness in multi-view 3D reconstruction, achieving consistent global structure and local details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-view 3D reconstruction methods suffer from incompleteness due to occlusions and sparse view coverage. While diffusion-based 3D generative methods can hallucinate invisible parts, their stochastic nature limits accuracy and consistency with input views.

Method: Proposes ReconViaGen framework that integrates reconstruction priors into generative framework. Addresses two key issues: (1) insufficiency in cross-view connections when extracting multi-view image features, and (2) poor controllability of iterative denoising for local detail generation.

Result: Extensive experiments show ReconViaGen can reconstruct complete and accurate 3D models that are consistent with input views in both global structure and local details.

Conclusion: ReconViaGen successfully bridges reconstruction and generation by incorporating reconstruction priors into diffusion-based 3D generation, overcoming limitations of both approaches to achieve complete and consistent 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Existing multi-view 3D object reconstruction methods heavily rely on
sufficient overlap between input views, where occlusions and sparse coverage in
practice frequently yield severe reconstruction incompleteness. Recent
advancements in diffusion-based 3D generative techniques offer the potential to
address these limitations by leveraging learned generative priors to
hallucinate invisible parts of objects, thereby generating plausible 3D
structures. However, the stochastic nature of the inference process limits the
accuracy and reliability of generation results, preventing existing
reconstruction frameworks from integrating such 3D generative priors. In this
work, we comprehensively analyze the reasons why diffusion-based 3D generative
methods fail to achieve high consistency, including (a) the insufficiency in
constructing and leveraging cross-view connections when extracting multi-view
image features as conditions, and (b) the poor controllability of iterative
denoising during local detail generation, which easily leads to plausible but
inconsistent fine geometric and texture details with inputs. Accordingly, we
propose ReconViaGen to innovatively integrate reconstruction priors into the
generative framework and devise several strategies that effectively address
these issues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReconViaGen can
reconstruct complete and accurate 3D models consistent with input views in both
global structure and local details.Project page:

*Rupasree Dey,Abdul Matin,Everett Lewark,Tanjim Bin Faruk,Andrei Bachinin,Sam Leuthold,M. Francesca Cotrufo,Shrideep Pallickara,Sangmi Lee Pallickara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepSalt is a deep learning framework that transfers high-resolution spectral knowledge from laboratory spectroscopy to satellite hyperspectral imagery for large-scale soil salinity monitoring without extensive ground sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soil salinization threatens ecosystems and agriculture by limiting water absorption and reducing crop productivity. Current methods face limitations: laboratory spectroscopy is precise but not scalable, while satellite imagery is scalable but lacks fine-grained interpretability.

Method: DeepSalt uses knowledge distillation and a novel Spectral Adaptation Unit to transfer spectral insights from laboratory-based spectroscopy to satellite-based hyperspectral sensing, enabling domain adaptation without extensive ground sampling.

Result: DeepSalt achieves significant performance gains over methods without explicit domain adaptation, effectively generalizes to unseen geographic regions, and explains a substantial portion of salinity variance.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the gap between laboratory precision and satellite scalability, enabling accurate large-scale soil salinity estimation through deep learning-based spectral transfer.

Abstract: Soil salinization poses a significant threat to both ecosystems and
agriculture because it limits plants' ability to absorb water and, in doing so,
reduces crop productivity. This phenomenon alters the soil's spectral
properties, creating a measurable relationship between salinity and light
reflectance that enables remote monitoring. While laboratory spectroscopy
provides precise measurements, its reliance on in-situ sampling limits
scalability to regional or global levels. Conversely, hyperspectral satellite
imagery enables wide-area observation but lacks the fine-grained
interpretability of laboratory instruments. To bridge this gap, we introduce
DeepSalt, a deep-learning-based spectral transfer framework that leverages
knowledge distillation and a novel Spectral Adaptation Unit to transfer
high-resolution spectral insights from laboratory-based spectroscopy to
satellite-based hyperspectral sensing. Our approach eliminates the need for
extensive ground sampling while enabling accurate, large-scale salinity
estimation, as demonstrated through comprehensive empirical benchmarks.
DeepSalt achieves significant performance gains over methods without explicit
domain adaptation, underscoring the impact of the proposed Spectral Adaptation
Unit and the knowledge distillation strategy. The model also effectively
generalized to unseen geographic regions, explaining a substantial portion of
the salinity variance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FRBNet is a plug-and-play frequency-domain module that uses channel ratios and learnable filters to extract illumination-invariant features for low-light vision tasks, improving object detection and segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing low-light vision methods have incomplete modeling of low-light conditions, leading to degraded performance in downstream tasks like detection and segmentation. The authors aim to better characterize low-light conditions by extending the Lambertian model and analyzing in the frequency domain.

Method: The authors propose FRBNet, an end-to-end trainable module that leverages frequency-domain channel ratios with a learnable frequency domain filter to extract illumination-invariant features. It can be integrated into existing networks without modifying loss functions.

Result: FRBNet achieves significant performance improvements: +2.2 mAP for dark object detection and +2.9 mIoU for nighttime segmentation across various downstream tasks.

Conclusion: FRBNet provides an effective plug-and-play solution for low-light vision tasks by leveraging frequency-domain analysis and learnable filtering to extract illumination-invariant features, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Low-light vision remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision due to
severe illumination degradation, which significantly affects the performance of
downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation. While recent
state-of-the-art methods have improved performance through invariant feature
learning modules, they still fall short due to incomplete modeling of low-light
conditions. Therefore, we revisit low-light image formation and extend the
classical Lambertian model to better characterize low-light conditions. By
shifting our analysis to the frequency domain, we theoretically prove that the
frequency-domain channel ratio can be leveraged to extract
illumination-invariant features via a structured filtering process. We then
propose a novel and end-to-end trainable module named \textbf{F}requency-domain
\textbf{R}adial \textbf{B}asis \textbf{Net}work (\textbf{FRBNet}), which
integrates the frequency-domain channel ratio operation with a learnable
frequency domain filter for the overall illumination-invariant feature
enhancement. As a plug-and-play module, FRBNet can be integrated into existing
networks for low-light downstream tasks without modifying loss functions.
Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks demonstrate that FRBNet
achieves superior performance, including +2.2 mAP for dark object detection and
+2.9 mIoU for nighttime segmentation. Code is available at:

*Josef Bigun,Fernado Alonso-Fernandez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reconciles two different structure tensor constructions (Bigun & Granlund 1987 vs Granlund & Knutsson 1995) through Total Least Squares line fitting to the power spectrum, showing they can be unified and simplified.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To theoretically reconcile two seemingly different approaches to structure tensor construction and demonstrate that viewing them through TLS line fitting reveals their common foundation and enables simplifications.

Method: Analyzes both structure tensor constructions through the lens of Total Least Squares line fitting to the power spectrum, showing their mathematical equivalence and proposing simplifications.

Result: The correction term in Granlund & Knutsson 1995 becomes unnecessary, ensuring positive semi-definite tensors with simplified eigenvalue interpretation. Enables fitting multiple orientations and use of alternative filters beyond quadrature filters.

Conclusion: Both structure tensor constructions can be unified under TLS line fitting, leading to simplified implementations, broader applicability with various filter types, and removal of unnecessary constraints while maintaining theoretical soundness.

Abstract: This note presents a theoretical discussion of two structure tensor
constructions: one proposed by Bigun and Granlund 1987, and the other by
Granlund and Knutsson 1995. At first glance, these approaches may appear quite
different--the former is implemented by averaging outer products of gradient
filter responses, while the latter constructs the tensor from weighted outer
products of tune-in frequency vectors of quadrature filters. We argue that when
both constructions are viewed through the common lens of Total Least Squares
(TLS) line fitting to the power spectrum, they can be reconciled to a large
extent, and additional benefits emerge. From this perspective, the correction
term introduced in Granlund and Knutsson 1995 becomes unnecessary. Omitting it
ensures that the resulting tensor remains positive semi-definite, thereby
simplifying the interpretation of its eigenvalues. Furthermore, this
interpretation allows fitting more than a single 0rientation to the input by
reinterpreting quadrature filter responses without relying on a structure
tensor. It also removes the constraint that responses must originate strictly
from quadrature filters, allowing the use of alternative filter types and
non-angular tessellations. These alternatives include Gabor filters--which,
although not strictly quadrature, are still suitable for structure tensor
construction--even when they tessellate the spectrum in a Cartesian fashion,
provided they are sufficiently concentrated.

### [169] [On the Faithfulness of Visual Thinking: Measurement and Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23482)
*Zujing Liu,Junwen Pan,Qi She,Yuan Gao,Guisong Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies unfaithfulness in vision-language models' multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning, where visual information is often inaccurate but still leads to correct answers. It proposes SCCM learning to improve visual faithfulness by ensuring sufficient yet minimal visual components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs generate multimodal chain-of-thought traces that incorporate inaccurate visual information while still producing correct answers, indicating a lack of faithfulness in the reasoning process due to RL rewards that only incentivize format rather than correctness of visual information.

Method: Proposes Sufficient-Component Cause Model (SCCM) learning, which encourages MCoT to generate sufficient yet minimal visual components that can independently lead to correct answers. SCCM is annotation-free and compatible with various reinforcement fine-tuning methods.

Result: Empirical results show that SCCM consistently improves visual faithfulness across fine-grained perception and reasoning benchmarks. The method reveals that current MCoT traces have unreliable and insufficient visual information.

Conclusion: SCCM learning effectively addresses the unfaithfulness problem in multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning by ensuring visual components are both reliable and sufficient, leading to more faithful reasoning processes in vision-language models.

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) can generate vision-text
multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) traces after reinforcement fine-tuning
(RFT). However, we observe that the visual information incorporated in MCoT is
often inaccurate, though still yield correct answers, indicating a lack of
faithfulness in the MCoT reasoning process. We attribute this unfaithfulness to
the RL reward in RFT, which solely incentivizes the format of interleaved
vision-text cues, ie, it encourages the model to incorporate visual information
into its text reasoning steps without considering the correctness of the visual
information. In this paper, we first probe the faithfulness of MCoT by
measuring how much the prediction changes when its visual and textual thoughts
are intervened. Surprisingly, the model's predictions remain nearly unchanged
under visual intervention but change significantly under textual intervention,
indicating that the visual evidence is largely ignored. To further analyze
visual information, we introduce an automated LVLM-based evaluation metric that
quantifies the faithfulness of visual cues from two perspectives: reliability
and sufficiency. Our evaluation reveals that the visual information in current
MCoT traces is simultaneously unreliable and insufficient. To address this
issue, we propose a novel MCoT learning strategy termed Sufficient-Component
Cause Model (SCCM) learning. This approach encourages the MCoT to generate
sufficient yet minimal visual components that are independently capable of
leading to correct answers. We note that the proposed SCCM is annotation-free
and compatible with various RFT for MCoT in a plug-and-play manner. Empirical
results demonstrate that SCCM consistently improves the visual faithfulness
across a suite of fine-grained perception and reasoning benchmarks. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DQ3D is a depth-guided query generator for 3D object detection that uses depth information and 2D detections to sample reference points from object surfaces/interiors, combined with a hybrid attention mechanism that fuses historical detections to handle occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D object detection methods using object queries from 3D reference points often suffer from false positives when reference points are far from target objects.

Method: Proposes depth-guided query generator that leverages depth information and 2D detections to sample reference points from object surfaces/interiors, plus hybrid attention mechanism that fuses historical detection results with depth-guided queries.

Result: Outperforms baseline by 6.3% in mAP and 4.3% in NDS on nuScenes dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed depth-guided query generation and hybrid attention mechanism effectively improve 3D object detection performance by ensuring better reference point sampling and handling occlusions.

Abstract: 3D object detection from multi-view images in traffic scenarios has garnered
significant attention in recent years. Many existing approaches rely on object
queries that are generated from 3D reference points to localize objects.
However, a limitation of these methods is that some reference points are often
far from the target object, which can lead to false positive detections. In
this paper, we propose a depth-guided query generator for 3D object detection
(DQ3D) that leverages depth information and 2D detections to ensure that
reference points are sampled from the surface or interior of the object.
Furthermore, to address partially occluded objects in current frame, we
introduce a hybrid attention mechanism that fuses historical detection results
with depth-guided queries, thereby forming hybrid queries. Evaluation on the
nuScenes dataset demonstrates that our method outperforms the baseline by 6.3\%
in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP) and 4.3\% in the NuScenes Detection
Score (NDS).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing transferability estimation methods struggle with emerging pre-trained models that have diverse architectures, training strategies, and task alignments, making it hard to identify the best models for downstream tasks efficiently.

Method: Proposes Implicit Transferability Modeling (ITM) framework that implicitly models each model's intrinsic transferability, combined with Divide-and-Conquer Variational Approximation (DVA) to efficiently approximate embedding space evolution.

Result: Extensive experiments on comprehensive benchmarks show ITM consistently outperforms existing methods in stability, effectiveness, and efficiency across various training regimes and model types.

Conclusion: ITM enables better generalization across diverse models and downstream tasks, advancing the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm by providing more accurate transferability assessment.

Abstract: Transferability estimation identifies the best pre-trained models for
downstream tasks without incurring the high computational cost of full
fine-tuning. This capability facilitates deployment and advances the
pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. However, existing methods often struggle
to accurately assess transferability for emerging pre-trained models with
diverse architectures, training strategies, and task alignments. In this work,
we propose Implicit Transferability Modeling (ITM), a novel framework that
implicitly models each model's intrinsic transferability, coupled with a
Divide-and-Conquer Variational Approximation (DVA) strategy to efficiently
approximate embedding space evolution. This design enables generalization
across a broader range of models and downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on
a comprehensive benchmark--spanning extensive training regimes and a wider
variety of model types--demonstrate that ITM consistently outperforms existing
methods in terms of stability, effectiveness, and efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes AG-Fusion, an adaptive gated fusion method for robust 3D object detection in challenging multimodal scenarios, achieving 93.92% on KITTI and 24.88% improvement on new E3D dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal camera-LiDAR fusion methods suffer significant performance degradation in challenging scenarios with sensor degradation or environmental disturbances.

Method: Projects features into unified BEV space with window-based attention, then uses adaptive gated fusion module based on cross-modal attention to selectively integrate reliable cross-modal knowledge.

Result: Achieves 93.92% accuracy on KITTI dataset and outperforms baseline by 24.88% on challenging E3D dataset, demonstrating superior robustness in complex industrial scenes.

Conclusion: AG-Fusion effectively handles unreliable modal information and maintains robust performance in complex environments through selective cross-modal knowledge integration.

Abstract: Multimodal camera-LiDAR fusion technology has found extensive application in
3D object detection, demonstrating encouraging performance. However, existing
methods exhibit significant performance degradation in challenging scenarios
characterized by sensor degradation or environmental disturbances. We propose a
novel Adaptive Gated Fusion (AG-Fusion) approach that selectively integrates
cross-modal knowledge by identifying reliable patterns for robust detection in
complex scenes. Specifically, we first project features from each modality into
a unified BEV space and enhance them using a window-based attention mechanism.
Subsequently, an adaptive gated fusion module based on cross-modal attention is
designed to integrate these features into reliable BEV representations robust
to challenging environments. Furthermore, we construct a new dataset named
Excavator3D (E3D) focusing on challenging excavator operation scenarios to
benchmark performance in complex conditions. Our method not only achieves
competitive performance on the standard KITTI dataset with 93.92% accuracy, but
also significantly outperforms the baseline by 24.88% on the challenging E3D

*Junho Kim,Young Min Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a zero-shot method using multimodal foundation models to find 3D scene analogies, enabling trajectory and waypoint transfer across different environments without additional training or fixed object vocabularies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D scene analogies require additional training and fixed object vocabularies, limiting their adaptability to new, unseen environments. The goal is to enable robots to connect current observations with prior experiences for better adaptation and planning.

Method: Uses a hybrid neural representation combining a sparse graph based on vision-language model features and a feature field from 3D shape foundation models. Scene analogies are found through coarse-to-fine alignment: first aligning the graph, then refining correspondences using feature fields.

Result: The method can establish accurate correspondences between complex scenes and successfully enables applications in trajectory and waypoint transfer across different 3D environments.

Conclusion: Multimodal foundation models enable effective 3D scene analogies in a zero-shot, open-vocabulary setting, overcoming limitations of previous methods that required training and fixed vocabularies.

Abstract: Connecting current observations with prior experiences helps robots adapt and
plan in new, unseen 3D environments. Recently, 3D scene analogies have been
proposed to connect two 3D scenes, which are smooth maps that align scene
regions with common spatial relationships. These maps enable detailed transfer
of trajectories or waypoints, potentially supporting demonstration transfer for
imitation learning or task plan transfer across scenes. However, existing
methods for the task require additional training and fixed object vocabularies.
In this work, we propose to use multimodal foundation models for finding 3D
scene analogies in a zero-shot, open-vocabulary setting. Central to our
approach is a hybrid neural representation of scenes that consists of a sparse
graph based on vision-language model features and a feature field derived from
3D shape foundation models. 3D scene analogies are then found in a
coarse-to-fine manner, by first aligning the graph and refining the
correspondence with feature fields. Our method can establish accurate
correspondences between complex scenes, and we showcase applications in
trajectory and waypoint transfer.

*Pascal Benschop,Cristian Meo,Justin Dauwels,Jelte P. Mense*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates using vision-language models (VLMs) as zero-shot anomaly detectors in video by converting video to text descriptions and scoring via textual entailment, evaluating their spatial reasoning capabilities for anomalous action recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The overwhelming amount of video data from widespread camera use creates a critical challenge for public safety and security, requiring automated detection of anomalous or criminal events that exceeds human monitoring capacity.

Method: Framing anomalous action recognition as zero-shot, language-grounded task using pre-trained VLMs to convert video into text descriptions and score labels via textual entailment, evaluated on UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 datasets under various prompting and privacy-preserving conditions.

Result: Few-shot exemplars can improve accuracy for some models but may increase false positives, while privacy filters (especially full-body GAN transforms) introduce inconsistencies that degrade accuracy. VLMs succeed with simple, spatially salient events but falter with noisy spatial cues and identity obfuscation.

Conclusion: The paper outlines paths to strengthen spatial grounding without task-specific training through structure-aware prompts, lightweight spatial memory, scene-graph or 3D-pose priors, and privacy methods preserving action-relevant geometry, positioning zero-shot language-grounded pipelines as adaptable building blocks for embodied video understanding.

Abstract: The widespread use of cameras in our society has created an overwhelming
amount of video data, far exceeding the capacity for human monitoring. This
presents a critical challenge for public safety and security, as the timely
detection of anomalous or criminal events is crucial for effective response and
prevention. The ability for an embodied agent to recognize unexpected events is
fundamentally tied to its capacity for spatial reasoning. This paper
investigates the spatial reasoning of vision-language models (VLMs) by framing
anomalous action recognition as a zero-shot, language-grounded task, addressing
the embodied perception challenge of interpreting dynamic 3D scenes from sparse
2D video. Specifically, we investigate whether small, pre-trained vision--LLMs
can act as spatially-grounded, zero-shot anomaly detectors by converting video
into text descriptions and scoring labels via textual entailment. We evaluate
four open models on UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 under prompting and
privacy-preserving conditions. Few-shot exemplars can improve accuracy for some
models, but may increase false positives, and privacy filters -- especially
full-body GAN transforms -- introduce inconsistencies that degrade accuracy.
These results chart where current vision--LLMs succeed (simple, spatially
salient events) and where they falter (noisy spatial cues, identity
obfuscation). Looking forward, we outline concrete paths to strengthen spatial
grounding without task-specific training: structure-aware prompts, lightweight
spatial memory across clips, scene-graph or 3D-pose priors during description,
and privacy methods that preserve action-relevant geometry. This positions
zero-shot, language-grounded pipelines as adaptable building blocks for
embodied, real-world video understanding. Our implementation for evaluating
VLMs is publicly available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DecoDINO improves upon DECO for human-object contact prediction by using dual DINOv2 encoders, class-balanced loss, and patch-level cross-attention, achieving better binary contact F1 scores, reduced geodesic error, and semantic labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like DECO struggle with binary contact maps, soft surfaces, occlusions, children, and false-positive foot contacts, limiting their accuracy in human-object interaction modeling.

Method: Three-branch network with two DINOv2 ViT-g/14 encoders, class-balanced loss weighting, patch-level cross-attention, and a lightweight MLP with softmax for semantic contact labeling.

Result: 7% improvement in binary-contact F1 score, halved geodesic error, added object-level semantic labels, and outperformed DAMON Challenge baseline in both tasks.

Conclusion: DecoDINO successfully addresses DECO's limitations through dual encoders and improved architecture, achieving state-of-the-art performance in human-object contact prediction.

Abstract: Accurate vertex-level contact prediction between humans and surrounding
objects is a prerequisite for high fidelity human object interaction models
used in robotics, AR/VR, and behavioral simulation. DECO was the first in the
wild estimator for this task but is limited to binary contact maps and
struggles with soft surfaces, occlusions, children, and false-positive foot
contacts. We address these issues and introduce DecoDINO, a three-branch
network based on DECO's framework. It uses two DINOv2 ViT-g/14 encoders,
class-balanced loss weighting to reduce bias, and patch-level cross-attention
for improved local reasoning. Vertex features are finally passed through a
lightweight MLP with a softmax to assign semantic contact labels. We also
tested a vision-language model (VLM) to integrate text features, but the
simpler architecture performed better and was used instead. On the DAMON
benchmark, DecoDINO (i) raises the binary-contact F1 score by 7$\%$, (ii)
halves the geodesic error, and (iii) augments predictions with object-level
semantic labels. Ablation studies show that LoRA fine-tuning and the dual
encoders are key to these improvements. DecoDINO outperformed the challenge
baseline in both tasks of the DAMON Challenge. Our code is available at

Motivation: Achieving robustness to varying camera viewpoints remains an open problem in end-to-end autonomous driving, as diverse vehicle configurations create real-world challenges with different camera perspectives.

Method: VR-Drive jointly learns 3D scene reconstruction as an auxiliary task for planning-aware view synthesis, uses a feed-forward inference strategy for online training-time augmentation, employs a viewpoint-mixed memory bank for temporal interaction across viewpoints, and applies viewpoint-consistent distillation to transfer knowledge from original to synthesized views.

Result: VR-Drive effectively mitigates synthesis-induced noise and improves planning under viewpoint shifts, demonstrating scalability and robustness for real-world deployment of end-to-end autonomous driving systems.

Conclusion: VR-Drive provides a scalable and robust solution for viewpoint generalization in end-to-end autonomous driving, with the framework trained in a fully end-to-end manner and accompanied by a new benchmark dataset for comprehensive evaluation.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) has emerged as a promising paradigm
that unifies perception, prediction, and planning into a holistic, data-driven
framework. However, achieving robustness to varying camera viewpoints, a common
real-world challenge due to diverse vehicle configurations, remains an open
problem. In this work, we propose VR-Drive, a novel E2E-AD framework that
addresses viewpoint generalization by jointly learning 3D scene reconstruction
as an auxiliary task to enable planning-aware view synthesis. Unlike prior
scene-specific synthesis approaches, VR-Drive adopts a feed-forward inference
strategy that supports online training-time augmentation from sparse views
without additional annotations. To further improve viewpoint consistency, we
introduce a viewpoint-mixed memory bank that facilitates temporal interaction
across multiple viewpoints and a viewpoint-consistent distillation strategy
that transfers knowledge from original to synthesized views. Trained in a fully
end-to-end manner, VR-Drive effectively mitigates synthesis-induced noise and
improves planning under viewpoint shifts. In addition, we release a new
benchmark dataset to evaluate E2E-AD performance under novel camera viewpoints,
enabling comprehensive analysis. Our results demonstrate that VR-Drive is a
scalable and robust solution for the real-world deployment of end-to-end
autonomous driving systems.

TL;DR: PathSearch is a retrieval framework for whole slide images that combines fine-grained mosaic representations with global slide embeddings using vision-language contrastive learning, enabling accurate image-to-image and text-to-image retrieval in digital pathology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The digitization of histopathology slides creates opportunities for computational tools, but effective WSI retrieval remains challenging due to gigapixel scale and difficulty capturing subtle semantic differences amid irrelevant content.

Method: Unifies fine-grained attentive mosaic representations with global-wise slide embeddings aligned through vision-language contrastive learning, trained on 6,926 slide-report pairs. Supports mosaic-based image-to-image retrieval and multi-modal text-to-slide retrieval.

Result: Outperforms traditional image-to-image retrieval frameworks on four public datasets and three in-house cohorts. Multi-center reader study shows improved diagnostic accuracy, boosted confidence, and enhanced inter-observer agreement among pathologists in clinical scenarios.

Conclusion: PathSearch establishes a scalable and generalizable retrieval solution for digital pathology that captures both fine-grained morphological cues and high-level semantic patterns for accurate and flexible retrieval.

Abstract: The rapid digitization of histopathology slides has opened up new
possibilities for computational tools in clinical and research workflows. Among
these, content-based slide retrieval stands out, enabling pathologists to
identify morphologically and semantically similar cases, thereby supporting
precise diagnoses, enhancing consistency across observers, and assisting
example-based education. However, effective retrieval of whole slide images
(WSIs) remains challenging due to their gigapixel scale and the difficulty of
capturing subtle semantic differences amid abundant irrelevant content. To
overcome these challenges, we present PathSearch, a retrieval framework that
unifies fine-grained attentive mosaic representations with global-wise slide
embeddings aligned through vision-language contrastive learning. Trained on a
corpus of 6,926 slide-report pairs, PathSearch captures both fine-grained
morphological cues and high-level semantic patterns to enable accurate and
flexible retrieval. The framework supports two key functionalities: (1)
mosaic-based image-to-image retrieval, ensuring accurate and efficient slide
research; and (2) multi-modal retrieval, where text queries can directly
retrieve relevant slides. PathSearch was rigorously evaluated on four public
pathology datasets and three in-house cohorts, covering tasks including
anatomical site retrieval, tumor subtyping, tumor vs. non-tumor discrimination,
and grading across diverse organs such as breast, lung, kidney, liver, and
stomach. External results show that PathSearch outperforms traditional
image-to-image retrieval frameworks. A multi-center reader study further
demonstrates that PathSearch improves diagnostic accuracy, boosts confidence,
and enhances inter-observer agreement among pathologists in real clinical
scenarios. These results establish PathSearch as a scalable and generalizable
retrieval solution for digital pathology.

### [179] [Through the Lens: Benchmarking Deepfake Detectors Against Moiré-Induced Distortions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23225)
*Razaib Tariq,Minji Heo,Simon S. Woo,Shahroz Tariq*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deepfake detectors suffer significant performance degradation (up to 25.4%) when faced with Moiré artifacts from smartphone-captured screen videos, and demoiréing methods actually worsen detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world deepfake detection faces challenges from Moiré artifacts introduced when capturing media from digital screens using smartphones, an issue that has been largely overlooked in existing research.

Method: Systematically evaluated 15 state-of-the-art deepfake detectors on 12,832 videos (35.64 hours) from multiple datasets, including newly created DeepMoiréFake (DMF) dataset and synthetic Moiré generation techniques.

Result: Moiré artifacts degraded detector performance by up to 25.4%, synthetic Moiré patterns caused 21.4% accuracy drop, and demoiréing methods unexpectedly reduced accuracy by up to 17.2%.

Conclusion: There is an urgent need for detection models robust to Moiré distortions and other real-world challenges; the DMF dataset aims to bridge the gap between controlled experiments and practical deepfake detection.

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a pressing challenge, particularly in real-world
settings where smartphone-captured media from digital screens often introduces
Moir\'e artifacts that can distort detection outcomes. This study
systematically evaluates state-of-the-art (SOTA) deepfake detectors on
Moir\'e-affected videos, an issue that has received little attention. We
collected a dataset of 12,832 videos, spanning 35.64 hours, from the Celeb-DF,
DFD, DFDC, UADFV, and FF++ datasets, capturing footage under diverse real-world
conditions, including varying screens, smartphones, lighting setups, and camera
angles. To further examine the influence of Moir\'e patterns on deepfake
detection, we conducted additional experiments using our DeepMoir\'eFake,
referred to as (DMF) dataset and two synthetic Moir\'e generation techniques.
Across 15 top-performing detectors, our results show that Moir\'e artifacts
degrade performance by as much as 25.4%, while synthetically generated Moir\'e
patterns lead to a 21.4% drop in accuracy. Surprisingly, demoir\'eing methods,
intended as a mitigation approach, instead worsened the problem, reducing
accuracy by up to 17.2%. These findings underscore the urgent need for
detection models that can robustly handle Moir\'e distortions alongside other
realworld challenges, such as compression, sharpening, and blurring. By
introducing the DMF dataset, we aim to drive future research toward closing the
gap between controlled experiments and practical deepfake detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Eruku is a new approach for styled handwritten text generation that frames the task as multimodal prompt-conditioned generation, using special textual tokens and classifier-free guidance to improve content controllability and reduce input requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoregressive transformer methods for handwritten text generation require additional inputs, lack proper stop mechanisms, create repetition loops, and produce visual artifacts. There's a need for better content controllability and alignment between text and visual tokens.

Method: Framed HTG as multimodal prompt-conditioned generation, introduced special textual input tokens for better alignment with visual tokens, and devised a classifier-free-guidance-based strategy for the autoregressive model.

Result: Eruku requires fewer inputs, generalizes better to unseen styles, and follows textual prompts more faithfully with improved content adherence compared to previous solutions.

Conclusion: The proposed Eruku approach successfully addresses content controllability issues in styled handwritten text generation by rethinking the autoregressive formulation and introducing better alignment mechanisms between text and visual modalities.

Abstract: Generating faithful and readable styled text images (especially for Styled
Handwritten Text generation - HTG) is an open problem with several possible
applications across graphic design, document understanding, and image editing.
A lot of research effort in this task is dedicated to developing strategies
that reproduce the stylistic characteristics of a given writer, with promising
results in terms of style fidelity and generalization achieved by the recently
proposed Autoregressive Transformer paradigm for HTG. However, this method
requires additional inputs, lacks a proper stop mechanism, and might end up in
repetition loops, generating visual artifacts. In this work, we rethink the
autoregressive formulation by framing HTG as a multimodal prompt-conditioned
generation task, and tackle the content controllability issues by introducing
special textual input tokens for better alignment with the visual ones.
Moreover, we devise a Classifier-Free-Guidance-based strategy for our
autoregressive model. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate
that our approach, dubbed Eruku, compared to previous solutions requires fewer
inputs, generalizes better to unseen styles, and follows more faithfully the
textual prompt, improving content adherence.

### [181] [A Video Is Not Worth a Thousand Words](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23253)
*Sam Pollard,Michael Wray*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Shapley values to compute feature attributions and modality scores for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) on video question answering tasks, revealing text dominance and the importance of ignoring distractors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about text dominance in VLMs and underdeveloped exploration of modality interactions, providing a method to measure progress in multi-modal model complexity.

Method: Joint computation of feature attributions and modality scores using Shapley values, treating video frames and textual elements as equal features, and analyzing multiple-choice VQA as interaction between video, question, and answer modalities.

Result: Analysis of 6 VLM models across 4 datasets shows dependence on text and reveals that multiple-choice VQA performance largely depends on models' ability to ignore distractors.

Conclusion: Current VLMs exhibit text dominance in VQA tasks, and the proposed Shapley-based metrics provide valuable insights into modality interactions and model behavior.

Abstract: As we become increasingly dependent on vision language models (VLMs) to
answer questions about the world around us, there is a significant amount of
research devoted to increasing both the difficulty of video question answering
(VQA) datasets, and the context lengths of the models that they evaluate. The
reliance on large language models as backbones has lead to concerns about
potential text dominance, and the exploration of interactions between
modalities is underdeveloped. How do we measure whether we're heading in the
right direction, with the complexity that multi-modal models introduce? We
propose a joint method of computing both feature attributions and modality
scores based on Shapley values, where both the features and modalities are
arbitrarily definable. Using these metrics, we compare $6$ VLM models of
varying context lengths on $4$ representative datasets, focusing on
multiple-choice VQA. In particular, we consider video frames and whole textual
elements as equal features in the hierarchy, and the multiple-choice VQA task
as an interaction between three modalities: video, question and answer. Our
results demonstrate a dependence on text and show that the multiple-choice VQA
task devolves into a model's ability to ignore distractors. Code available at

*Veska Tsenkova,Peter Stanchev,Daniel Petrov,Deyan Lazarov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an end-to-end hierarchical CNN model based on YOLO for image detection and classification that captures natural hierarchical relationships between objects, with novel architecture, loss function, and performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world objects have natural hierarchical organization that can significantly help classification tasks, providing better contextual understanding and control over mistake severity, which flat classification methods overlook.

Method: Built upon YOLO model family with novel hierarchical architecture, modified loss function, and hierarchical performance metrics; trained on two hierarchical categorizations of the same dataset - systematic and visual similarity-based.

Result: The methodology successfully addresses inherent hierarchical structure in real-world objects that conventional flat classification algorithms miss.

Conclusion: Hierarchical classification models better capture real-world object relationships and provide improved contextual understanding compared to traditional flat classification approaches.

Abstract: Current convolution neural network (CNN) classification methods are
predominantly focused on flat classification which aims solely to identify a
specified object within an image. However, real-world objects often possess a
natural hierarchical organization that can significantly help classification
tasks. Capturing the presence of relations between objects enables better
contextual understanding as well as control over the severity of mistakes.
Considering these aspects, this paper proposes an end-to-end hierarchical model
for image detection and classification built upon the YOLO model family. A
novel hierarchical architecture, a modified loss function, and a performance
metric tailored to the hierarchical nature of the model are introduced. The
proposed model is trained and evaluated on two different hierarchical
categorizations of the same dataset: a systematic categorization that
disregards visual similarities between objects and a categorization accounting
for common visual characteristics across classes. The results illustrate how
the suggested methodology addresses the inherent hierarchical structure present
in real-world objects, which conventional flat classification algorithms often
overlook.

TL;DR: AdaSDE is a novel single-step SDE solver that dynamically regulates error correction strength to accelerate diffusion sampling, achieving state-of-the-art performance with only 5 NFE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complementary weaknesses of ODE and SDE-based solvers in diffusion processes - ODE solvers accumulate irreducible gradient error while SDE methods suffer from amplified discretization errors with limited step budgets.

Method: Introduces AdaSDE with a single per-step learnable coefficient estimated via lightweight distillation, which dynamically regulates error correction strength. Can be integrated with existing solvers.

Result: State-of-the-art performance: FID scores of 4.18 on CIFAR-10, 8.05 on FFHQ and 6.96 on LSUN Bedroom at only 5 NFE.

Conclusion: AdaSDE successfully unifies the efficiency of ODEs with the error resilience of SDEs, providing an effective framework for accelerated diffusion sampling that can enhance existing solvers.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative processes, formulated as differential equation
solving, frequently balance computational speed with sample quality. Our
theoretical investigation of ODE- and SDE-based solvers reveals complementary
weaknesses: ODE solvers accumulate irreducible gradient error along
deterministic trajectories, while SDE methods suffer from amplified
discretization errors when the step budget is limited. Building upon this
insight, we introduce AdaSDE, a novel single-step SDE solver that aims to unify
the efficiency of ODEs with the error resilience of SDEs. Specifically, we
introduce a single per-step learnable coefficient, estimated via lightweight
distillation, which dynamically regulates the error correction strength to
accelerate diffusion sampling. Notably, our framework can be integrated with
existing solvers to enhance their capabilities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance: at 5 NFE, AdaSDE achieves FID scores
of 4.18 on CIFAR-10, 8.05 on FFHQ and 6.96 on LSUN Bedroom. Codes are available

*Haochen Zhao,Yuyao Kong,Yongxiu Xu,Gaopeng Gou,Hongbo Xu,Yubin Wang,Haoliang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMSD3.0, a multi-image sarcasm detection benchmark, and proposes CIRM model with cross-image reasoning and fine-grained cross-modal fusion for improved sarcasm detection in both single and multi-image scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal sarcasm detection methods focus on single-image scenarios, overlooking semantic and affective relations across multiple images that trigger sarcasm in real-world settings.

Method: Proposed Cross-Image Reasoning Model (CIRM) with targeted cross-image sequence modeling to capture inter-image connections, and relevance-guided fine-grained cross-modal fusion based on text-image correspondence.

Result: MMSD3.0 proves to be an effective benchmark reflecting real-world conditions, and CIRM achieves state-of-the-art performance across MMSD, MMSD2.0 and MMSD3.0 datasets.

Conclusion: CIRM effectively handles both single-image and multi-image sarcasm detection scenarios, validating the importance of modeling cross-image relationships for improved sarcasm detection.

Abstract: Despite progress in multimodal sarcasm detection, existing datasets and
methods predominantly focus on single-image scenarios, overlooking potential
semantic and affective relations across multiple images. This leaves a gap in
modeling cases where sarcasm is triggered by multi-image cues in real-world
settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMSD3.0, a new benchmark composed
entirely of multi-image samples curated from tweets and Amazon reviews. We
further propose the Cross-Image Reasoning Model (CIRM), which performs targeted
cross-image sequence modeling to capture latent inter-image connections. In
addition, we introduce a relevance-guided, fine-grained cross-modal fusion
mechanism based on text-image correspondence to reduce information loss during
integration. We establish a comprehensive suite of strong and representative
baselines and conduct extensive experiments, showing that MMSD3.0 is an
effective and reliable benchmark that better reflects real-world conditions.
Moreover, CIRM demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across MMSD, MMSD2.0
and MMSD3.0, validating its effectiveness in both single-image and multi-image
scenarios.

*Yingying Feng,Jie Li,Jie Hu,Yukang Zhang,Lei Tan,Jiayi Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MDReID is a flexible any-to-any image-level ReID framework that handles both modality-matched and modality-mismatched scenarios by decomposing modality features into shared and specific components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world ReID systems face modality inconsistencies where query and gallery images come from different sensors (RGB, NIR, TIR), but most existing methods assume modality-matched conditions, limiting their practical robustness and scalability.

Method: MDReID introduces Modality Decoupling Learning (MDL) to decompose features into modality-shared and modality-specific representations, and Modality-aware Metric Learning (MML) to enforce orthogonality and complementarity between components.

Result: Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show MDReID achieves significant mAP improvements: 9.8%, 3.0%, 11.5% in modality-matched scenarios and average gains of 3.4%, 11.8%, 10.9% in modality-mismatched scenarios.

Conclusion: MDReID effectively addresses modality inconsistency challenges in ReID systems through explicit feature decomposition and tailored metric learning, demonstrating superior performance across both modality-aligned and mismatched conditions.

Abstract: Real-world object re-identification (ReID) systems often face modality
inconsistencies, where query and gallery images come from different sensors
(e.g., RGB, NIR, TIR). However, most existing methods assume modality-matched
conditions, which limits their robustness and scalability in practical
applications. To address this challenge, we propose MDReID, a flexible
any-to-any image-level ReID framework designed to operate under both
modality-matched and modality-mismatched scenarios. MDReID builds on the
insight that modality information can be decomposed into two components:
modality-shared features that are predictable and transferable, and
modality-specific features that capture unique, modality-dependent
characteristics. To effectively leverage this, MDReID introduces two key
components: the Modality Decoupling Learning (MDL) and Modality-aware Metric
Learning (MML). Specifically, MDL explicitly decomposes modality features into
modality-shared and modality-specific representations, enabling effective
retrieval in both modality-aligned and mismatched scenarios. MML, a tailored
metric learning strategy, further enforces orthogonality and complementarity
between the two components to enhance discriminative power across modalities.
Extensive experiments conducted on three challenging multi-modality ReID
benchmarks (RGBNT201, RGBNT100, MSVR310) consistently demonstrate the
superiority of MDReID. Notably, MDReID achieves significant mAP improvements of
9.8\%, 3.0\%, and 11.5\% in general modality-matched scenarios, and average
gains of 3.4\%, 11.8\%, and 10.9\% in modality-mismatched scenarios,
respectively. The code is available at:

TL;DR: A tiling-and-aggregation pipeline for classifying paclitaxel exposure from phase-contrast microscopy images achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, improving over baseline by ~20 percentage points, with enhanced interpretability through Grad-CAM and Score-CAM analyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image analysis is crucial for drug discovery and preclinical evaluation, but current full-image models struggle with subtle dose differences in paclitaxel exposure classification from phase-contrast microscopy of C6 glioma cells.

Method: Proposed a simple tiling-and-aggregation pipeline that processes local patches and combines tile outputs into an image label, with interpretability enhanced through Grad-CAM and Score-CAM attention analyses.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on the benchmark dataset, improving over the published baseline by approximately 20 percentage points, with trends confirmed by cross-validation.

Conclusion: The tiling approach proves effective for handling subtle dose differences, and attention analyses provide interpretability insights that point toward robustness-oriented directions for future medical image research.

Abstract: Medical image analysis is central to drug discovery and preclinical
evaluation, where scalable, objective readouts can accelerate decision-making.
We address classification of paclitaxel (Taxol) exposure from phase-contrast
microscopy of C6 glioma cells -- a task with subtle dose differences that
challenges full-image models. We propose a simple tiling-and-aggregation
pipeline that operates on local patches and combines tile outputs into an image
label, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the benchmark dataset and
improving over the published baseline by around 20 percentage points, with
trends confirmed by cross-validation. To understand why tiling is effective, we
further apply Grad-CAM and Score-CAM and attention analyses, which enhance
model interpretability and point toward robustness-oriented directions for
future medical image research. Code is released to facilitate reproduction and

TL;DR: PlanarTrack is a large-scale benchmark for planar tracking with 1,150 sequences and over 733K frames, including both short-term and long-term videos recorded in unconstrained wild conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of planar tracking in the deep learning era is limited due to lack of large-scale platforms, so the authors created PlanarTrack to address this gap.

Method: Created a comprehensive benchmark with 1,150 sequences (1,000 short-term + 150 long-term) recorded in unconstrained conditions, manually annotated with four corner points per frame, with each sequence containing a unique target to enhance diversity.

Result: PlanarTrack is the largest and most diverse planar tracking dataset, and evaluation of 10 representative trackers shows significant performance degradation on this challenging benchmark.

Conclusion: Current planar trackers struggle on the challenging PlanarTrack benchmark, indicating more research effort is needed to improve planar tracking performance for real-world applications.

Abstract: Planar tracking has drawn increasing interest owing to its key roles in
robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent great advancement, further
development of planar tracking, particularly in the deep learning era, is
largely limited compared to generic tracking due to the lack of large-scale
platforms. To mitigate this, we propose PlanarTrack, a large-scale high-quality
and challenging benchmark for planar tracking. Specifically, PlanarTrack
consists of 1,150 sequences with over 733K frames, including 1,000 short-term
and 150 new long-term videos, which enables comprehensive evaluation of short-
and long-term tracking performance. All videos in PlanarTrack are recorded in
unconstrained conditions from the wild, which makes PlanarTrack challenging but
more realistic for real-world applications. To ensure high-quality annotations,
each video frame is manually annotated by four corner points with multi-round
meticulous inspection and refinement. To enhance target diversity of
PlanarTrack, we only capture a unique target in one sequence, which is
different from existing benchmarks. To our best knowledge, PlanarTrack is by
far the largest and most diverse and challenging dataset dedicated to planar
tracking. To understand performance of existing methods on PlanarTrack and to
provide a comparison for future research, we evaluate 10 representative planar
trackers with extensive comparison and in-depth analysis. Our evaluation
reveals that, unsurprisingly, the top planar trackers heavily degrade on the
challenging PlanarTrack, which indicates more efforts are required for
improving planar tracking. Our data and results will be released at

*Songxi Yang,Tang Sui,Qunying Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LSSR is an efficient super-resolution framework for remote sensing that uses pretrained Stable Diffusion with multimodal auxiliary data (DEM, land cover, SAR) and specialized losses to enhance crop boundary recovery while maintaining spectral fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current remote sensing super-resolution methods: expensive training requirements, slow inference, limited use of auxiliary information as real-world constraints, and lack of downstream task evaluation.

Method: Built on frozen pretrained Stable Diffusion, integrates crossmodal attention with auxiliary knowledge (Digital Elevation Model, land cover, month) and Synthetic Aperture Radar guidance, enhanced by adapters and a tailored Fourier NDVI loss.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance with PSNR/SSIM of 32.63/0.84 (RGB) and 23.99/0.78 (IR), lowest NDVI MSE (0.042), efficient inference (0.39 sec/image), and improved crop classification (F1: 0.86) compared to Sentinel-2 (F1: 0.85).

Conclusion: LSSR demonstrates the potential of remote sensing super-resolution to advance precision agriculture through efficient, scientifically realistic image reconstruction with effective downstream task transfer.

Abstract: Super resolution offers a way to harness medium even lowresolution but
historically valuable remote sensing image archives. Generative models,
especially diffusion models, have recently been applied to remote sensing super
resolution (RSSR), yet several challenges exist. First, diffusion models are
effective but require expensive training from scratch resources and have slow
inference speeds. Second, current methods have limited utilization of auxiliary
information as real-world constraints to reconstruct scientifically realistic
images. Finally, most current methods lack evaluation on downstream tasks. In
this study, we present a efficient LSSR framework for RSSR, supported by a new
multimodal dataset of paired 30 m Landsat 8 and 10 m Sentinel 2 imagery. Built
on frozen pretrained Stable Diffusion, LSSR integrates crossmodal attention
with auxiliary knowledge (Digital Elevation Model, land cover, month) and
Synthetic Aperture Radar guidance, enhanced by adapters and a tailored Fourier
NDVI loss to balance spatial details and spectral fidelity. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that LSSR significantly improves crop boundary
delineation and recovery, achieving state-of-the-art performance with Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio/Structural Similarity Index Measure of 32.63/0.84 (RGB)
and 23.99/0.78 (IR), and the lowest NDVI Mean Squared Error (0.042), while
maintaining efficient inference (0.39 sec/image). Moreover, LSSR transfers
effectively to NASA Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel (HLS) super resolution,
yielding more reliable crop classification (F1: 0.86) than Sentinel-2 (F1:
0.85). These results highlight the potential of RSSR to advance precision
agriculture.

*Lu Dong,Haiyu Zhang,Han Lin,Ziang Yan,Xiangyu Zeng,Hongjie Zhang,Yifei Huang,Yi Wang,Zhen-Hua Ling,Limin Wang,Yali Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoTG-R1 is a curriculum RL framework that addresses two key challenges in video temporal grounding: partially annotated samples and hard-to-ground samples, achieving superior performance with only 10% of training data and 21% of computational budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs for video temporal grounding overlook challenges from training sample quality and difficulty - specifically, partially annotated samples that introduce ambiguous supervision, and hard-to-ground samples that produce indistinguishable rewards during RL training.

Method: Proposes VideoTG-R1 with two key components: (1) Boundary Reflection Agent that uses MLLMs to predict query-relevant timestamps outside annotated intervals to filter ambiguous samples, and (2) Difficulty Estimation Agent that assesses training difficulty and implements curriculum RL by dynamically masking videos of hard-to-ground samples based on training steps.

Result: Experiments show VideoTG-R1 outperforms full-data counterparts on VTG and grounded VideoQA tasks, achieving better performance with only 10% of training samples and 21% of computational budget under both GRPO and SFT settings.

Conclusion: The proposed curriculum RL framework with reflected boundary annotations enables data-efficient training by addressing sample quality and difficulty challenges, demonstrating significant improvements in video temporal grounding performance with substantially reduced data and computational requirements.

Abstract: Video temporal grounding (VTG) aims to locate precise segments in videos
based on language queries, which is a fundamental challenge in video
understanding. While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown
promise in tackling VTG through reinforcement learning (RL), they overlook the
challenges arising from both the quality and difficulty of training samples.
(1) Partially annotated samples. Many samples contain relevant segments beyond
the annotated interval, introducing ambiguous supervision. (2) Hard-to-ground
samples. Samples with poor zero-shot performance produce consistently low and
indistinguishable rewards during RL training, exhibiting no clear preference
among multiple outputs and thus hindering learning efficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose VideoTG-R1, a novel curriculum RL framework with
reflected boundary annotations, enabling data-efficient training. Specifically,
we propose a Boundary Reflection Agent that utilizes MLLMs to predict
query-relevant timestamps outside the annotated intervals, allowing us to
identify and filter out partially annotated samples, thereby reducing
ambiguity. Furthermore, we introduce a Difficulty Estimation Agent to assess
the training difficulty of each sample and design a curriculum RL strategy that
dynamically masks the videos of hard-to-ground samples according to the
training steps, easing the training difficulty and providing clearer
preference. Experiments on the VTG and grounded VideoQA tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Remarkably, with only 10% of the training samples
and 21% of the computational budget, VideoTG-R1 outperforms full-data

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point cloud learning faces limitations due to scarce large-scale datasets, unlike image or text domains with abundant data.

Method: Uses symmetry concepts to create shapes with known structure and high variability through formula-driven generation, allowing arbitrary scale dataset creation.

Result: Effective for self-supervised pre-training, yielding models with strong performance in classification and segmentation tasks, plus good few-shot learning capabilities and real-world object classification.

Conclusion: Symmetria provides a scalable, extensible solution for point cloud data scarcity with public availability of dataset and code, promoting further research in point cloud learning.

Abstract: Unlike image or text domains that benefit from an abundance of large-scale
datasets, point cloud learning techniques frequently encounter limitations due
to the scarcity of extensive datasets. To overcome this limitation, we present
Symmetria, a formula-driven dataset that can be generated at any arbitrary
scale. By construction, it ensures the absolute availability of precise ground
truth, promotes data-efficient experimentation by requiring fewer samples,
enables broad generalization across diverse geometric settings, and offers easy
extensibility to new tasks and modalities. Using the concept of symmetry, we
create shapes with known structure and high variability, enabling neural
networks to learn point cloud features effectively. Our results demonstrate
that this dataset is highly effective for point cloud self-supervised
pre-training, yielding models with strong performance in downstream tasks such
as classification and segmentation, which also show good few-shot learning
capabilities. Additionally, our dataset can support fine-tuning models to
classify real-world objects, highlighting our approach's practical utility and
application. We also introduce a challenging task for symmetry detection and
provide a benchmark for baseline comparisons. A significant advantage of our
approach is the public availability of the dataset, the accompanying code, and
the ability to generate very large collections, promoting further research and
innovation in point cloud learning.

Abstract: Foundation models in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming medical
imaging by enabling general-purpose feature learning from large-scale,
unlabeled datasets. In this work, we introduce BrainFound, a self-supervised
foundation model for brain MRI, built by extending DINO-v2, a vision
transformer originally designed for 2D natural images. BrainFound adapts
DINO-v2 to model full 3D brain anatomy by incorporating volumetric information

*Marco Antonio Ortiz Rincon,Yihui Yang,Christoph Holst*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel workflow for registering mobile laser scanning point clouds in urban environments using SSC preprocessing and PV-GICP fine registration, achieving sub-0.01m accuracy with 50% faster computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in urban MLS point cloud registration including varying density, noise characteristics, and occlusion scenarios in bustling city centers.

Method: SSC preprocessing fragments MLS trajectory data using mutually orthogonal planar surfaces, plus PV-GICP fine registration that selectively uses planar surfaces within voxel partitions.

Result: Achieves sub-0.01m average registration accuracy on Munich datasets while reducing computation time by more than 50% compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: The workflow advances automated 3D urban modeling for applications in urban planning, infrastructure management, and dynamic city monitoring.

Abstract: This study presents a novel workflow designed to efficiently and accurately
register large-scale mobile laser scanning (MLS) point clouds to a target model
point cloud in urban street scenarios. This workflow specifically targets the
complexities inherent in urban environments and adeptly addresses the
challenges of integrating point clouds that vary in density, noise
characteristics, and occlusion scenarios, which are common in bustling city
centers. Two methodological advancements are introduced. First, the proposed
Semi-sphere Check (SSC) preprocessing technique optimally fragments MLS
trajectory data by identifying mutually orthogonal planar surfaces. This step
reduces the impact of MLS drift on the accuracy of the entire point cloud
registration, while ensuring sufficient geometric features within each fragment
to avoid local minima. Second, we propose Planar Voxel-based Generalized
Iterative Closest Point (PV-GICP), a fine registration method that selectively
utilizes planar surfaces within voxel partitions. This pre-process strategy not
only improves registration accuracy but also reduces computation time by more
than 50% compared to conventional point-to-plane ICP methods. Experiments on
real-world datasets from Munich's inner city demonstrate that our workflow
achieves sub-0.01 m average registration accuracy while significantly
shortening processing times. The results underscore the potential of the
proposed methods to advance automated 3D urban modeling and updating, with
direct applications in urban planning, infrastructure management, and dynamic
city monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel CAD reverse engineering method that uses multi-plane cross-sections to extract 2D patterns and capture parametric details, enabling reconstruction of editable CAD models with sketch constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning approaches for CAD reverse engineering either fail to produce fully parametric outputs (bottom-up methods) or overlook fine geometric details (top-down methods), and none incorporate essential sketch-level constraints.

Method: Leverages multi-plane cross-sections to extract 2D patterns and capture fine parametric details, inspired by how human designers manually perform CAD reverse engineering tasks.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods and enables reconstruction of detailed, editable CAD models with direct incorporation of sketch constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses limitations of existing methods by combining effective parametric detail capture with sketch constraint integration, mirroring human design processes.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a foundational role in modern manufacturing
and product development, often requiring designers to modify or build upon
existing models. Converting 3D scans into parametric CAD representations--a
process known as CAD reverse engineering--remains a significant challenge due
to the high precision and structural complexity of CAD models. Existing deep
learning-based approaches typically fall into two categories: bottom-up,
geometry-driven methods, which often fail to produce fully parametric outputs,
and top-down strategies, which tend to overlook fine-grained geometric details.
Moreover, current methods neglect an essential aspect of CAD modeling:
sketch-level constraints. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to CAD
reverse engineering inspired by how human designers manually perform the task.
Our method leverages multi-plane cross-sections to extract 2D patterns and
capture fine parametric details more effectively. It enables the reconstruction
of detailed and editable CAD models, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
and, for the first time, incorporating sketch constraints directly into the
reconstruction process.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CURVETE is a novel deep CNN that uses curriculum learning and progressive self-supervised training to address limited samples and irregular class distribution in medical image analysis, achieving superior performance on three medical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of limited annotated samples and irregular class distribution in medical image analysis, where traditional transfer learning approaches have reduced effectiveness when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

Method: Proposes CURVETE framework that employs curriculum learning based on sample decomposition granularity during pre-training, and class decomposition approach for downstream tasks to handle irregular class distributions.

Result: Achieved accuracies of 96.60% (brain tumour), 75.60% (digital knee x-ray), and 93.35% (Mini-DDSM) with ResNet-50; and 95.77%, 80.36%, 93.22% respectively with DenseNet-121, outperforming other training strategies.

Conclusion: CURVETE effectively addresses challenges of limited samples and irregular class distribution in medical image analysis through curriculum learning and progressive self-supervised training, demonstrating superior performance across multiple medical datasets.

Abstract: Identifying high-quality and easily accessible annotated samples poses a
notable challenge in medical image analysis. Transfer learning techniques,
leveraging pre-training data, offer a flexible solution to this issue. However,
the impact of fine-tuning diminishes when the dataset exhibits an irregular
distribution between classes. This paper introduces a novel deep convolutional
neural network, named Curriculum Learning and Progressive Self-supervised
Training (CURVETE). CURVETE addresses challenges related to limited samples,
enhances model generalisability, and improves overall classification
performance. It achieves this by employing a curriculum learning strategy based
on the granularity of sample decomposition during the training of generic
unlabelled samples. Moreover, CURVETE address the challenge of irregular class
distribution by incorporating a class decomposition approach in the downstream
task. The proposed method undergoes evaluation on three distinct medical image
datasets: brain tumour, digital knee x-ray, and Mini-DDSM datasets. We
investigate the classification performance using a generic self-supervised
sample decomposition approach with and without the curriculum learning
component in training the pretext task. Experimental results demonstrate that
the CURVETE model achieves superior performance on test sets with an accuracy
of 96.60% on the brain tumour dataset, 75.60% on the digital knee x-ray
dataset, and 93.35% on the Mini-DDSM dataset using the baseline ResNet-50.
Furthermore, with the baseline DenseNet-121, it achieved accuracies of 95.77%,
80.36%, and 93.22% on the brain tumour, digital knee x-ray, and Mini-DDSM
datasets, respectively, outperforming other training strategies.

TL;DR: Video-Thinker extends "Thinking with Images" to video reasoning by enabling MLLMs to autonomously use grounding and captioning capabilities for generating reasoning clues, achieving state-of-the-art performance on video reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image reasoning methods like "Thinking with Images" have shown success in MLLMs but haven't been extended to video reasoning tasks, creating a gap in dynamic video understanding capabilities.

Method: Proposes Video-Thinker framework with Video-Thinker-10K dataset for autonomous tool usage in chain-of-thought reasoning, using SFT for format learning followed by GRPO for capability strengthening.

Result: Video-Thinker-7B substantially outperforms existing baselines like Video-R1 and achieves state-of-the-art performance on in-domain and out-of-domain video reasoning benchmarks including Video-Holmes, CG-Bench-Reasoning, and VRBench.

Conclusion: Video-Thinker successfully enables MLLMs to autonomously navigate grounding and captioning for video reasoning without external tools, establishing new state-of-the-art performance for 7B-sized MLLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in image reasoning methods, particularly "Thinking with
Images", have demonstrated remarkable success in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs); however, this dynamic reasoning paradigm has not yet been
extended to video reasoning tasks. In this paper, we propose Video-Thinker,
which empowers MLLMs to think with videos by autonomously leveraging their
intrinsic "grounding" and "captioning" capabilities to generate reasoning clues
throughout the inference process. To spark this capability, we construct
Video-Thinker-10K, a curated dataset featuring autonomous tool usage within
chain-of-thought reasoning sequences. Our training strategy begins with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to learn the reasoning format, followed by Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen this reasoning capability.
Through this approach, Video-Thinker enables MLLMs to autonomously navigate
grounding and captioning tasks for video reasoning, eliminating the need for
constructing and calling external tools. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Video-Thinker achieves significant performance gains on both in-domain tasks
and challenging out-of-domain video reasoning benchmarks, including
Video-Holmes, CG-Bench-Reasoning, and VRBench. Our Video-Thinker-7B
substantially outperforms existing baselines such as Video-R1 and establishes

*Karthikeyan Chandra Sekaran,Markus Geisler,Dominik Rößle,Adithya Mohan,Daniel Cremers,Wolfgang Utschick,Michael Botsch,Werner Huber,Torsten Schön*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UrbanIng-V2X is the first large-scale multi-modal dataset for cooperative perception across multiple urban intersections, featuring synchronized data from vehicles and infrastructure sensors with comprehensive 3D annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cooperative perception datasets are limited to single intersections or vehicles, causing overfitting and misleading performance. There's a need for diverse multi-intersection datasets to better benchmark algorithms in varied traffic environments.

Method: Created UrbanIng-V2X dataset with 34 temporally aligned sensor sequences from 3 intersections in Ingolstadt, Germany, involving 2 vehicles and up to 3 infrastructure sensor poles per sequence. Data includes vehicle-mounted RGB cameras/LiDARs and infrastructure thermal cameras/LiDARs.

Result: Dataset contains approximately 712k annotated 3D bounding boxes across 13 object classes at 10 Hz frequency. Provides comprehensive evaluations using state-of-the-art cooperative perception methods.

Conclusion: UrbanIng-V2X addresses the gap in multi-intersection cooperative perception datasets and enables more robust benchmarking of algorithms in diverse urban traffic scenarios.

Abstract: Recent cooperative perception datasets have played a crucial role in
advancing smart mobility applications by enabling information exchange between
intelligent agents, helping to overcome challenges such as occlusions and
improving overall scene understanding. While some existing real-world datasets
incorporate both vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure interactions,
they are typically limited to a single intersection or a single vehicle. A
comprehensive perception dataset featuring multiple connected vehicles and
infrastructure sensors across several intersections remains unavailable,
limiting the benchmarking of algorithms in diverse traffic environments.
Consequently, overfitting can occur, and models may demonstrate misleadingly
high performance due to similar intersection layouts and traffic participant
behavior. To address this gap, we introduce UrbanIng-V2X, the first
large-scale, multi-modal dataset supporting cooperative perception involving
vehicles and infrastructure sensors deployed across three urban intersections
in Ingolstadt, Germany. UrbanIng-V2X consists of 34 temporally aligned and
spatially calibrated sensor sequences, each lasting 20 seconds. All sequences
contain recordings from one of three intersections, involving two vehicles and
up to three infrastructure-mounted sensor poles operating in coordinated
scenarios. In total, UrbanIng-V2X provides data from 12 vehicle-mounted RGB
cameras, 2 vehicle LiDARs, 17 infrastructure thermal cameras, and 12
infrastructure LiDARs. All sequences are annotated at a frequency of 10 Hz with
3D bounding boxes spanning 13 object classes, resulting in approximately 712k
annotated instances across the dataset. We provide comprehensive evaluations
using state-of-the-art cooperative perception methods and publicly release the
codebase, dataset, HD map, and a digital twin of the complete data collection
environment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MergeMix is a training-time augmentation paradigm that bridges supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning for vision-language alignment in MLLMs, using attention-aware image mixing and preference-driven training with SimPO loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between scalability, robustness, and alignment quality in vision-language alignment, where SFT requires large human annotations and RL suffers from overhead and instability.

Method: Proposes MergeMix with attention-aware image mixing via token merge with cluster representation and spatial context, then uses preference-driven training by building preference pairs with mixed/raw images and optimizing via SimPO loss.

Result: MergeMix enhances attention consistency and efficiency, surpassing other heuristic-based methods in classification, achieving competitive accuracy with improved efficiency.

Conclusion: MergeMix provides a scalable approach to preference alignment in classification and MLLMs, bridging the gap between SFT and RL methods.

Abstract: Vision-language alignment in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs)
typically relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning
(RL). SFT is stable and efficient but requires large-scale human annotations
and cannot capture subtle preferences, while RL brings in a reward signal for
training, but suffers from overhead and instability. These limitations
highlight a trade-off between scalability, robustness, and alignment quality.
To address this, we propose MergeMix, a training-time augmentation paradigm
that bridges SFT and RL. It first applies an attention-aware image mixing via
token merge with more cluster representation and spatial context, and then
presents a preference-driven training paradigm for MLLMs by building preference
pairs with mixed images and raw images, and optimizing via SimPO loss. As a
mixup augmentation, MergeMix enhances attention consistency and efficiency,
surpassing other heuristic-based methods in classification. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MergeMix achieves competitive accuracy with
improved efficiency, providing a scalable approach to preference alignment in
classification and MLLMs.

*Elisabeth Jüttner,Leona Krath,Stefan Korfhage,Hannah Dröge,Matthias B. Hullin,Markus Plack*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid relighting framework that combines diffusion-derived material priors with temporal regularization and physically motivated rendering for stable volumetric video relighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches struggle with temporal stability in volumetric video relighting. Diffusion methods work for single frames but suffer from noise and instability in sequences, while video diffusion models face memory and scale limitations.

Method: Combines diffusion-derived material priors with optical-flow-guided temporal regularization and physically motivated rendering using mesh proxies from Gaussian Opacity Fields.

Result: Achieves substantially more stable relighting across sequences than diffusion-only baselines and scales beyond feasible clip lengths for video diffusion.

Conclusion: Hybrid approaches balancing learned priors with physically grounded constraints are a practical step toward production-ready volumetric video relighting.

Abstract: Volumetric video relighting is essential for bringing captured performances
into virtual worlds, but current approaches struggle to deliver temporally
stable, production-ready results. Diffusion-based intrinsic decomposition
methods show promise for single frames, yet suffer from stochastic noise and
instability when extended to sequences, while video diffusion models remain
constrained by memory and scale. We propose a hybrid relighting framework that
combines diffusion-derived material priors with temporal regularization and
physically motivated rendering. Our method aggregates multiple stochastic
estimates of per-frame material properties into temporally consistent shading
components, using optical-flow-guided regularization. For indirect effects such
as shadows and reflections, we extract a mesh proxy from Gaussian Opacity
Fields and render it within a standard graphics pipeline. Experiments on real
and synthetic captures show that this hybrid strategy achieves substantially
more stable relighting across sequences than diffusion-only baselines, while
scaling beyond the clip lengths feasible for video diffusion. These results
indicate that hybrid approaches, which balance learned priors with physically
grounded constraints, are a practical step toward production-ready volumetric
video relighting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VOLD is a framework that transfers reasoning capabilities from text-only teacher models to vision-language student models using reinforcement learning with on-policy distillation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on complex reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scarcity of high-quality image-text reasoning data by leveraging abundant text-based reasoning resources to enhance vision-language model reasoning capabilities.

Method: Combines reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with on-policy distillation, guided by text-only teacher models, and emphasizes cold-start alignment via supervised fine-tuning.

Result: Outperforms baseline models significantly and improves state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks including MMMU-Pro, MathVision, MathVista, and LogicVista.

Conclusion: Effective transfer of reasoning capabilities requires cold-start alignment between teacher and student models, and on-policy distillation with text-only teachers provides meaningful guidance when proper distributional alignment is established.

Abstract: Training vision-language models (VLMs) for complex reasoning remains a
challenging task, i.a. due to the scarcity of high-quality image-text reasoning
data. Conversely, text-based reasoning resources are abundant and scalable, but
it is still an open question how to leveraging them for VLM reasoning. To
address this problem, we propose VOLD, a framework to transfer reasoning
capabilities from text-only teacher models to VLM student models. To this end,
VOLD combines reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) with on-policy distillation, which allows the student reasoning traces
to be guided by the teacher model, resulting in a significant gain over using
GRPO alone. We further show that a cold-start alignment is essential for an
effective transfer during the online training phase in this scenario and that
without sufficient distributional alignment between teacher and student,
on-policy distillation fails to provide meaningful guidance. We evaluate VOLD
across diverse benchmarks including MMMU-Pro, MathVision, MathVista, and
LogicVista, showing that VOLD outperforms the baseline model significantly and
improves over the state of the art by a margin. Our ablation shows the
importance of a cold-start alignment via SFT for on-policy distillation with a
text-only teacher.

Conclusion: iPac provides a versatile and generic solution for medical image classification by leveraging graph representations that account for inherent structure and relationships among visual entities.

Abstract: Graph neural networks have emerged as a promising paradigm for image

a limited consideration of the underlying structure and relationships among
visual entities. This work presents iPac, a novel approach to introduce a new
graph representation of images to enhance graph neural network image
classification by recognizing the importance of underlying structure and
relationships in medical image classification. iPac integrates various stages,
including patch partitioning, feature extraction, clustering, graph
construction, and graph-based learning, into a unified network to advance graph
neural network image classification. By capturing relevant features and
organising them into clusters, we construct a meaningful graph representation
that effectively encapsulates the semantics of the image. Experimental
evaluation on diverse medical image datasets demonstrates the efficacy of iPac,
exhibiting an average accuracy improvement of up to 5% over baseline methods.
Our approach offers a versatile and generic solution for image classification,
particularly in the realm of medical images, by leveraging the graph
representation and accounting for the inherent structure and relationships
among visual entities.

*Yaoli Liu,Yao-Xiang Ding,Kun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeFuse is a training-free method for multi-subject text-to-image generation that automatically fuses multiple subject LoRAs using dynamic masks derived from cross-attention weights, requiring no additional training or auxiliary models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-subject generation either rely on pre-inference LoRA weight merging or complex techniques like segmentation models and noise blending, which are inefficient and require additional resources.

Method: The approach automatically derives context-aware dynamic subject masks from cross-attention layer weights and applies them to LoRA outputs during inference, approximating individual subject LoRA usage for masked regions without modifying LoRAs.

Result: Extensive experiments show that FreeFuse outperforms existing approaches in both generation quality and usability for multi-subject generation tasks.

Conclusion: FreeFuse provides a superior practical and efficient solution for multi-subject text-to-image generation that requires no training, no LoRA modifications, no auxiliary models, and minimal user input beyond LoRA activation words.

Abstract: This paper proposes FreeFuse, a novel training-free approach for
multi-subject text-to-image generation through automatic fusion of multiple
subject LoRAs. In contrast to existing methods that either focus on
pre-inference LoRA weight merging or rely on segmentation models and complex
techniques like noise blending to isolate LoRA outputs, our key insight is that
context-aware dynamic subject masks can be automatically derived from
cross-attention layer weights. Mathematical analysis shows that directly
applying these masks to LoRA outputs during inference well approximates the
case where the subject LoRA is integrated into the diffusion model and used
individually for the masked region. FreeFuse demonstrates superior practicality
and efficiency as it requires no additional training, no modification to LoRAs,
no auxiliary models, and no user-defined prompt templates or region
specifications. Alternatively, it only requires users to provide the LoRA
activation words for seamless integration into standard workflows. Extensive
experiments validate that FreeFuse outperforms existing approaches in both
generation quality and usability under the multi-subject generation tasks. The

Motivation: Current MLLMs excel at visible event reasoning but lack embodied, first-person understanding needed for egocentric video reasoning, which requires inferring hidden intentions and recognizing fine-grained interactions from the agent's perspective.

Method: 1) Created EgoRe-5M dataset from 13M egocentric video clips with detailed CoT rationales and hand-object grounding; 2) Used supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on EgoRe-5M to teach reasoning skills; 3) Applied reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) to enhance spatio-temporal localization.

Result: EgoThinker outperforms existing methods across multiple egocentric benchmarks and achieves substantial improvements in fine-grained spatio-temporal localization tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully bridges the gap in egocentric reasoning for MLLMs through comprehensive dataset construction and two-stage training, demonstrating strong performance on challenging egocentric video understanding tasks.

Abstract: Egocentric video reasoning centers on an unobservable agent behind the camera
who dynamically shapes the environment, requiring inference of hidden
intentions and recognition of fine-grained interactions. This core challenge
limits current multimodal large language models MLLMs, which excel at visible
event reasoning but lack embodied, first-person understanding. To bridge this
gap, we introduce EgoThinker, a novel framework that endows MLLMs with robust
egocentric reasoning capabilities through spatio-temporal chain-of-thought
supervision and a two-stage learning curriculum. First, we introduce EgoRe-5M,
a large-scale egocentric QA dataset constructed from 13M diverse egocentric
video clips. This dataset features multi-minute segments annotated with
detailed CoT rationales and dense hand-object grounding. Second, we employ SFT
on EgoRe-5M to instill reasoning skills, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning
RFT to further enhance spatio-temporal localization. Experimental results show
that EgoThinker outperforms existing methods across multiple egocentric
benchmarks, while achieving substantial improvements in fine-grained

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MERGE is a unified model that enables both image generation and depth estimation using pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, preventing catastrophic forgetting through a plug-and-play framework with Group Reuse Mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models for depth estimation while preserving their original image generation capabilities, addressing the problem of catastrophic degradation when updating parameters.

Method: Introduces a plug-and-play framework with simple converters for switching between modes, and a Group Reuse Mechanism to encourage parameter reuse and improve utilization of additional learnable parameters.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple depth estimation benchmarks while maintaining original image generation ability.

Conclusion: MERGE demonstrates that pre-trained text-to-image models can be expanded to depth estimation effortlessly while preserving their core capabilities, offering a unified solution for both tasks.

Abstract: Generative depth estimation methods leverage the rich visual priors stored in
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating astonishing zero-shot
capability. However, parameter updates during training lead to catastrophic
degradation in the image generation capability of the pre-trained model. We
introduce MERGE, a unified model for image generation and depth estimation,
starting from a fixed pre-trained text-to-image model. MERGE demonstrates that
the pre-trained text-to-image model can do more than image generation, but also
expand to depth estimation effortlessly. Specifically, MERGE introduces a
play-and-plug framework that enables seamless switching between image
generation and depth estimation modes through simple and pluggable converters.
Meanwhile, we propose a Group Reuse Mechanism to encourage parameter reuse and
improve the utilization of the additional learnable parameters. MERGE unleashes
the powerful depth estimation capability of the pre-trained text-to-image model
while preserving its original image generation ability. Compared to other
unified models for image generation and depth estimation, MERGE achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple depth estimation benchmarks. The

### [205] [Lookahead Anchoring: Preserving Character Identity in Audio-Driven Human Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23581)
*Junyoung Seo,Rodrigo Mira,Alexandros Haliassos,Stella Bounareli,Honglie Chen,Linh Tran,Seungryong Kim,Zoe Landgraf,Jie Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lookahead Anchoring addresses identity drift in audio-driven human animation by using future keyframes as directional anchors instead of fixed boundaries, enabling better identity preservation without restricting natural motion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Audio-driven human animation models suffer from identity drift during temporal autoregressive generation, where characters gradually lose their identity over time. Existing solutions using keyframes as temporal anchors require additional generation stages and can restrict natural motion dynamics.

Method: Proposes Lookahead Anchoring which leverages keyframes from future timesteps ahead of the current generation window, transforming keyframes from fixed boundaries into directional beacons. This allows the model to continuously pursue future anchors while responding to immediate audio cues, and enables self-keyframing where the reference image serves as the lookahead target.

Result: The method achieves superior lip synchronization, identity preservation, and visual quality when applied to three recent human animation models. Temporal lookahead distance naturally controls the balance between expressivity and consistency.

Conclusion: Lookahead Anchoring demonstrates improved temporal conditioning across several different architectures, eliminating the need for keyframe generation entirely while maintaining consistent identity through persistent guidance.

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation models often suffer from identity drift during
temporal autoregressive generation, where characters gradually lose their
identity over time. One solution is to generate keyframes as intermediate
temporal anchors that prevent degradation, but this requires an additional
keyframe generation stage and can restrict natural motion dynamics. To address
this, we propose Lookahead Anchoring, which leverages keyframes from future
timesteps ahead of the current generation window, rather than within it. This
transforms keyframes from fixed boundaries into directional beacons: the model
continuously pursues these future anchors while responding to immediate audio
cues, maintaining consistent identity through persistent guidance. This also
enables self-keyframing, where the reference image serves as the lookahead
target, eliminating the need for keyframe generation entirely. We find that the
temporal lookahead distance naturally controls the balance between expressivity
and consistency: larger distances allow for greater motion freedom, while
smaller ones strengthen identity adherence. When applied to three recent human
animation models, Lookahead Anchoring achieves superior lip synchronization,
identity preservation, and visual quality, demonstrating improved temporal
conditioning across several different architectures. Video results are

*Guangting Zheng,Qinyu Zhao,Tao Yang,Fei Xiao,Zhijie Lin,Jie Wu,Jiajun Deng,Yanyong Zhang,Rui Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FARMER is a novel generative framework that combines Normalizing Flows and Autoregressive models for tractable likelihood estimation and high-quality image synthesis directly from raw pixels, addressing challenges in pixel-level modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Directly modeling explicit likelihood of raw data distribution is key in machine learning, but continuous AR modeling over visual pixel data suffers from extremely long sequences and high-dimensional spaces.

Method: FARMER uses an invertible autoregressive flow to transform images into latent sequences, employs self-supervised dimension reduction to partition latent channels, and includes one-step distillation and resampling-based classifier-free guidance.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that FARMER achieves competitive performance compared to existing pixel-based generative models while providing exact likelihoods and scalable training.

Conclusion: FARMER successfully unifies NF and AR models for tractable likelihood estimation and high-quality image synthesis, overcoming challenges in pixel-level modeling.

Abstract: Directly modeling the explicit likelihood of the raw data distribution is key
topic in the machine learning area, which achieves the scaling successes in
Large Language Models by autoregressive modeling. However, continuous AR
modeling over visual pixel data suffer from extremely long sequences and
high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we present FARMER, a novel end-to-end
generative framework that unifies Normalizing Flows (NF) and Autoregressive
(AR) models for tractable likelihood estimation and high-quality image
synthesis directly from raw pixels. FARMER employs an invertible autoregressive
flow to transform images into latent sequences, whose distribution is modeled
implicitly by an autoregressive model. To address the redundancy and complexity
in pixel-level modeling, we propose a self-supervised dimension reduction
scheme that partitions NF latent channels into informative and redundant
groups, enabling more effective and efficient AR modeling. Furthermore, we
design a one-step distillation scheme to significantly accelerate inference
speed and introduce a resampling-based classifier-free guidance algorithm to
boost image generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FARMER
achieves competitive performance compared to existing pixel-based generative
models while providing exact likelihoods and scalable training.

*Erich Liang,Roma Bhattacharjee,Sreemanti Dey,Rafael Moschopoulos,Caitlin Wang,Michel Liao,Grace Tan,Andrew Wang,Karhan Kayan,Stamatis Alexandropoulos,Jia Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InFlux is a real-world benchmark providing per-frame ground truth camera intrinsics for 386 videos with dynamic intrinsics, featuring 143K+ annotated frames to address the lack of dynamic camera intrinsics benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most 3D algorithms assume constant camera intrinsics, but real-world videos often have dynamic intrinsics. Existing benchmarks lack diversity in scene content and intrinsics variation, and none provide per-frame intrinsic changes.

Method: Built a comprehensive lookup table of calibration experiments and extended the Kalibr toolbox to improve accuracy and robustness for per-frame intrinsics annotation. Created 386 high-resolution indoor/outdoor videos with dynamic camera intrinsics.

Result: Created InFlux benchmark with 143K+ annotated frames showing wider intrinsic variations and scene diversity than prior benchmarks. Evaluation shows most existing methods struggle with accurate predictions on videos with dynamic intrinsics.

Conclusion: InFlux addresses the critical gap in dynamic camera intrinsics benchmarks and enables better evaluation of 3D understanding methods for real-world videos with changing camera parameters.

Abstract: Accurately tracking camera intrinsics is crucial for achieving 3D
understanding from 2D video. However, most 3D algorithms assume that camera
intrinsics stay constant throughout a video, which is often not true for many
real-world in-the-wild videos. A major obstacle in this field is a lack of
dynamic camera intrinsics benchmarks--existing benchmarks typically offer
limited diversity in scene content and intrinsics variation, and none provide
per-frame intrinsic changes for consecutive video frames. In this paper, we
present Intrinsics in Flux (InFlux), a real-world benchmark that provides
per-frame ground truth intrinsics annotations for videos with dynamic
intrinsics. Compared to prior benchmarks, InFlux captures a wider range of
intrinsic variations and scene diversity, featuring 143K+ annotated frames from
386 high-resolution indoor and outdoor videos with dynamic camera intrinsics.
To ensure accurate per-frame intrinsics, we build a comprehensive lookup table
of calibration experiments and extend the Kalibr toolbox to improve its
accuracy and robustness. Using our benchmark, we evaluate existing baseline
methods for predicting camera intrinsics and find that most struggle to achieve
accurate predictions on videos with dynamic intrinsics. For the dataset, code,

### [208] [PRISM-Bench: A Benchmark of Puzzle-Based Visual Tasks with CoT Error Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23594)
*Yusu Qian,Cheng Wan,Chao Jia,Yinfei Yang,Qingyu Zhao,Zhe Gan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM-Bench is a visual puzzle benchmark that evaluates multimodal language models' reasoning by requiring them to identify the first incorrect step in flawed chain-of-thought explanations, rather than just measuring final answer accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations only measure final-answer accuracy, failing to assess how models reason. There's a need to evaluate logical consistency, error detection, and visual reasoning capabilities more deeply.

Method: Create visual puzzles requiring multi-step symbolic, geometric, and analogical reasoning. Present models with chain-of-thought explanations containing exactly one error and require them to identify the first incorrect step.

Result: Evaluations reveal a persistent gap between fluent generation and faithful reasoning - models that produce plausible CoTs often fail to locate simple logical faults in reasoning chains.

Conclusion: PRISM-Bench provides a sharper evaluation of multimodal reasoning competence and highlights the need for diagnostic evaluation protocols to develop trustworthy MLLMs, disentangling answer generation from reasoning verification.

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{PRISM-Bench}, a benchmark of puzzle-based visual
challenges designed to evaluate not only whether models can solve problems, but
how their reasoning unfolds. Unlike prior evaluations that measure only
final-answer accuracy, PRISM-Bench introduces a diagnostic task: given a visual
puzzle and a step-by-step chain-of-thought (CoT) containing exactly one error,
models must identify the first incorrect step. This setting enables
fine-grained assessment of logical consistency, error detection, and visual
reasoning. The puzzles in PRISM-Bench require multi-step symbolic, geometric,
and analogical reasoning, resisting shortcuts based on superficial pattern
matching. Evaluations across state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal a persistent gap
between fluent generation and faithful reasoning: models that produce plausible
CoTs often fail to locate simple logical faults. By disentangling answer
generation from reasoning verification, PRISM-Bench offers a sharper lens on
multimodal reasoning competence and underscores the need for diagnostic
evaluation protocols in the development of trustworthy MLLMs.

*Yuqian Yuan,Wenqiao Zhang,Xin Li,Shihao Wang,Kehan Li,Wentong Li,Jun Xiao,Lei Zhang,Beng Chin Ooi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixelRefer is a unified region-level multimodal LLM framework that enables fine-grained object-centric understanding in images and videos, with an efficient variant called PixelRefer-Lite that reduces computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing MLLMs focus on holistic scene-level understanding but lack fine-grained object-centric reasoning capabilities needed for detailed visual comprehension.

Method: Proposes Scale-Adaptive Object Tokenizer (SAOT) to generate compact object representations from free-form regions, and PixelRefer-Lite with Object-Centric Infusion module to pre-fuse global context into object tokens for efficiency.

Result: Achieves leading performance with fewer training samples across benchmarks, while PixelRefer-Lite maintains competitive accuracy with substantial efficiency gains.

Conclusion: PixelRefer enables advanced fine-grained understanding over user-specified regions, addressing the gap in object-centric reasoning while offering efficient alternatives through its lightweight variants.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
general-purpose capabilities in open-world visual comprehension. However, most
existing MLLMs primarily focus on holistic, scene-level understanding, often
overlooking the need for fine-grained, object-centric reasoning. In this paper,
we present PixelRefer, a unified region-level MLLM framework that enables
advanced fine-grained understanding over user-specified regions across both
images and videos. Motivated by the observation that LLM attention
predominantly focuses on object-level tokens, we propose a Scale-Adaptive
Object Tokenizer (SAOT) to generate compact and semantically rich object
representations from free-form regions. Our analysis reveals that global visual
tokens contribute mainly in early LLM layers, inspiring the design of
PixelRefer-Lite, an efficient variant that employs an Object-Centric Infusion
module to pre-fuse global context into object tokens. This yields a lightweight
Object-Only Framework that substantially reduces computational cost while
maintaining high semantic fidelity. To facilitate fine-grained instruction
tuning, we curate PixelRefer-2.2M, a high-quality object-centric instruction
dataset. Extensive experiments across a range of benchmarks validate that
PixelRefer achieves leading performance with fewer training samples, while
PixelRefer-Lite offers competitive accuracy with notable gains in efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Concerto is a minimalist approach for spatial cognition that combines 3D intra-modal self-distillation with 2D-3D cross-modal joint embedding, achieving state-of-the-art performance in 3D scene understanding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by how humans learn abstract concepts through multisensory synergy and can recall them from single modalities, the authors aim to develop a similar capability for spatial cognition in AI systems.

Method: Concerto combines 3D intra-modal self-distillation with 2D-3D cross-modal joint embedding. It also includes variants for video-lifted point cloud spatial understanding and a translator to project representations into CLIP's language space.

Result: Concerto outperforms standalone SOTA 2D and 3D self-supervised models by 14.2% and 4.8% respectively in linear probing for 3D scene perception. With full fine-tuning, it achieves 80.7% mIoU on ScanNet and sets new SOTA results across multiple scene understanding benchmarks.

Conclusion: Concerto learns more coherent and informative spatial features with superior fine-grained geometric and semantic consistency, demonstrating that multisensory-inspired approaches can significantly advance spatial representation learning.

Abstract: Humans learn abstract concepts through multisensory synergy, and once formed,
such representations can often be recalled from a single modality. Inspired by
this principle, we introduce Concerto, a minimalist simulation of human concept
learning for spatial cognition, combining 3D intra-modal self-distillation with
2D-3D cross-modal joint embedding. Despite its simplicity, Concerto learns more
coherent and informative spatial features, as demonstrated by zero-shot
visualizations. It outperforms both standalone SOTA 2D and 3D self-supervised
models by 14.2% and 4.8%, respectively, as well as their feature concatenation,
in linear probing for 3D scene perception. With full fine-tuning, Concerto sets
new SOTA results across multiple scene understanding benchmarks (e.g., 80.7%
mIoU on ScanNet). We further present a variant of Concerto tailored for
video-lifted point cloud spatial understanding, and a translator that linearly
projects Concerto representations into CLIP's language space, enabling
open-world perception. These results highlight that Concerto emerges spatial
representations with superior fine-grained geometric and semantic consistency.

### [211] [A Robotic Stirring Method with Trajectory Optimization and Adaptive Speed Control for Accurate Pest Counting in Water Traps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21732)
*Xumin Gao,Mark Stevens,Grzegorz Cielniak*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a robotic stirring method with trajectory optimization and adaptive speed control to improve pest counting accuracy in water traps by addressing occlusion issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image-based pest counting methods struggle with pest occlusion in water traps, limiting their accuracy in monitoring pest population dynamics for precision agriculture.

Method: Developed an automated stirring system using a robotic arm with six different trajectories (circle, square, triangle, spiral, four small circles, random lines), selected optimal trajectory based on counting performance, and implemented a counting confidence-driven closed-loop control system for adaptive-speed stirring.

Result: The method successfully addresses pest occlusion by altering pest distribution through stirring, making occluded individuals visible for detection and counting.

Conclusion: This is the first study to investigate stirring trajectory effects on object counting in dynamic liquid environments and implement adaptive-speed stirring for such tasks, providing an effective solution for accurate pest monitoring in agriculture.

Abstract: Accurate monitoring of pest population dynamics is crucial for informed
decision-making in precision agriculture. Currently, mainstream image-based
pest counting methods primarily rely on image processing combined with machine
learning or deep learning for pest counting. However, these methods have
limitations and struggle to handle situations involving pest occlusion. To
address this issue, this paper proposed a robotic stirring method with
trajectory optimization and adaptive speed control for accurate pest counting
in water traps. First, we developed an automated stirring system for pest
counting in yellow water traps based on a robotic arm. Stirring alters the
distribution of pests in the yellow water trap, making some of the occluded
individuals visible for detection and counting. Then, we investigated the
impact of different stirring trajectories on pest counting performance and
selected the optimal trajectory for pest counting. Specifically, we designed
six representative stirring trajectories, including circle, square, triangle,
spiral, four small circles, and random lines, for the robotic arm to stir. And
by comparing the overall average counting error and counting confidence of
different stirring trajectories across various pest density scenarios, we
determined the optimal trajectory. Finally, we proposed a counting
confidence-driven closed-loop control system to achieve adaptive-speed
stirring. It uses changes in pest counting confidence between consecutive
frames as feedback to adjust the stirring speed. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first study dedicated to investigating the effects of different
stirring trajectories on object counting in the dynamic liquid environment and
to implement adaptive-speed stirring for this type of task. Experimental
results show ...

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel force-sensing system using fiber Bragg gratings and electromagnetic tracking enables real-time measurement of interaction forces during robot-assisted left atrial appendage closure, providing radiation-free feedback for improved deployment precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LAAC procedures rely on manual catheter control with fluoroscopy and transesophageal echocardiography, which have limitations including radiation exposure and limited positioning precision.

Method: Used a force-sensing delivery sheath with fiber Bragg gratings combined with electromagnetic tracking to measure interaction forces and catheter tip position during robot-assisted LAAC deployment in an anatomical phantom.

Result: The force-displacement profiling method revealed low-magnitude interaction forces, suggesting minimal mechanical stress on surrounding anatomy, and successfully identified key procedural steps without ionizing radiation.

Conclusion: This approach shows promise for providing enhanced intraoperative feedback to clinicians and improving deployment outcomes, with future work focusing on automating deployment classification and validation in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of thromboembolic events due to
impaired function of the left atrial appendage (LAA). Left atrial appendage
closure (LAAC) is a minimally invasive intervention designed to reduce stroke
risk by sealing the LAA with an expandable occluder device. Current deployment
relies on manual catheter control and imaging modalities like fluoroscopy and
transesophageal echocardiography, which carry limitations including radiation
exposure and limited positioning precision. In this study, we leverage a
previously developed force-sensing delivery sheath integrating fiber Bragg
gratings (FBGs) at the interface between the catheter and the occluder.
Combined with electromagnetic (EM) tracking, this setup enables real-time
measurement of interaction forces and catheter tip position during
robot-assisted LAAC deployment in an anatomical phantom. We present a novel
force-displacement profiling method that characterizes occluder deployment
dynamics and identifies key procedural steps without relying on ionizing
radiation. The force profiles reveal low-magnitude interaction forces,
suggesting minimal mechanical stress on the surrounding anatomy. This approach
shows promise in providing clinicians with enhanced intraoperative feedback,
improving deployment outcome. Future work will focus on automating deployment
steps classification and validating the sensing strategy in dynamic, realistic
environments.

*Yuhui Liu,Shian Wang,Ansel Panicker,Kate Embry,Ayana Asanova,Tianyi Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper develops a Phase-Aware AI (PAAI) car-following model specifically for electric vehicles (EVs) to address their unique dynamics like rapid acceleration and regenerative braking, which differ from internal combustion engine vehicles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing microscopic models effectively capture ICE vehicle behavior but lack accuracy for EVs' distinct dynamics. With increasing EV presence in traffic, there's a need for an accurate and easy-to-use analytical model for EV car-following behavior.

Method: Developed a Phase-Aware AI (PAAI) car-following model that enhances traditional physics-based frameworks with AI components to recognize and adapt to different driving phases like rapid acceleration and regenerative braking. Validated using real-world trajectory data from vehicles with adaptive cruise control through comprehensive simulations.

Result: The PAAI model significantly improves prediction accuracy over traditional car-following models, demonstrating better performance in capturing EV-specific driving behaviors.

Conclusion: The proposed PAAI model provides an effective tool for accurately representing EV behavior in traffic simulations, addressing the gap in modeling EV-specific car-following dynamics.

Abstract: Internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and electric vehicles (EVs) exhibit
distinct vehicle dynamics. EVs provide rapid acceleration, with electric motors
producing peak power across a wider speed range, and achieve swift deceleration
through regenerative braking. While existing microscopic models effectively
capture the driving behavior of ICE vehicles, a modeling framework that
accurately describes the unique car-following dynamics of EVs is lacking.
Developing such a model is essential given the increasing presence of EVs in
traffic, yet creating an easy-to-use and accurate analytical model remains
challenging.
  To address these gaps, this study develops and validates a Phase-Aware AI
(PAAI) car-following model specifically for EVs. The proposed model enhances
traditional physics-based frameworks with an AI component that recognizes and
adapts to different driving phases, such as rapid acceleration and regenerative
braking. Using real-world trajectory data from vehicles equipped with adaptive
cruise control (ACC), we conduct comprehensive simulations to validate the
model's performance. The numerical results demonstrate that the PAAI model
significantly improves prediction accuracy over traditional car-following
models, providing an effective tool for accurately representing EV behavior in
traffic simulations.

*Yuhui Liu,Samannita Halder,Shian Wang,Tianyi Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel adaptive cruise control framework using LSTM networks and physics-informed constraints that incorporates social value orientation to enable AVs to regulate traffic flow while balancing individual objectives with system-wide efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AV control strategies focus on individual vehicle or platoon optimization but neglect interactions with human-driven vehicles and broader traffic flow impacts, potentially exacerbating congestion and reducing system efficiency.

Method: Proposed a neural network-based socially compliant AV control framework with social value orientation (SVO), defining utility functions for both AVs and HVs that are optimized based on each AV's SVO to balance control objectives with traffic flow considerations.

Result: The method effectively adapts to varying traffic conditions, enhancing system-wide efficiency. When AV control shifts from energy priority to traffic flow optimization, following platoon vehicles experience at least 58.99% increase in energy consumption alongside at least 38.39% improvement in average speed.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enables AVs to function as mobile traffic regulators, promoting adaptive driving behaviors that reduce congestion, improve traffic efficiency, and lower energy consumption while accounting for interactions with human-driven vehicles.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel control framework for adaptive cruise control
(ACC) in automated driving, leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
and physics-informed constraints. As automated vehicles (AVs) adopt advanced
features like ACC, transportation systems are becoming increasingly intelligent
and efficient. However, existing AV control strategies primarily focus on
optimizing the performance of individual vehicles or platoons, often neglecting
their interactions with human-driven vehicles (HVs) and the broader impact on
traffic flow. This oversight can exacerbate congestion and reduce overall
system efficiency. To address this critical research gap, we propose a neural
network-based, socially compliant AV control framework that incorporates social
value orientation (SVO). This framework enables AVs to account for their
influence on HVs and traffic dynamics. By leveraging AVs as mobile traffic
regulators, the proposed approach promotes adaptive driving behaviors that
reduce congestion, improve traffic efficiency, and lower energy consumption.
Within this framework, we define utility functions for both AVs and HVs, which
are optimized based on the SVO of each AV to balance its own control objectives
with broader traffic flow considerations. Numerical results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method in adapting to varying traffic conditions,
thereby enhancing system-wide efficiency. Specifically, when the AV's control
mode shifts from prioritizing energy consumption to optimizing traffic flow
efficiency, vehicles in the following platoon experience at least a 58.99%
increase in individual energy consumption alongside at least a 38.39%
improvement in individual average speed, indicating significant enhancements in
traffic dynamics.

Conclusion: The paper provides a comprehensive demonstration and automation roadmap for integrating LLMs into multi-scale UAV operations, identifying technical prerequisites and research challenges at each stage of the automation evolution from current capabilities to fully autonomous systems.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), their
capabilities in various automation domains, particularly Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV) operations, have garnered increasing attention. Current research
remains predominantly constrained to small-scale UAV applications, with most
studies focusing on isolated components such as path planning for toy drones,
while lacking comprehensive investigation of medium- and long-range UAV systems
in real-world operational contexts. Larger UAV platforms introduce distinct
challenges, including stringent requirements for airport-based take-off and

operational capabilities with elevated mission expectations. This position
paper presents the Next-Generation LLM for UAV (NeLV) system -- a comprehensive
demonstration and automation roadmap for integrating LLMs into multi-scale UAV
operations. The NeLV system processes natural language instructions to
orchestrate short-, medium-, and long-range UAV missions through five key
technical components: (i) LLM-as-Parser for instruction interpretation, (ii)
Route Planner for Points of Interest (POI) determination, (iii) Path Planner
for waypoint generation, (iv) Control Platform for executable trajectory
implementation, and (v) UAV monitoring. We demonstrate the system's feasibility
through three representative use cases spanning different operational scales:
multi-UAV patrol, multi-POI delivery, and multi-hop relocation. Beyond the
current implementation, we establish a five-level automation taxonomy that
charts the evolution from current LLM-as-Parser capabilities (Level 1) to fully

### [216] [FORGE-Tree: Diffusion-Forcing Tree Search for Long-Horizon Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21744)
*Yanjia Huang,Shuo Liu,Sheng Liu,Qingxiao Xu,Mingyang Wu,Xiangbo Gao,Zhengzhong Tu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FORGE-Tree is a plug-in control layer that improves long-horizon robot manipulation by combining stage-aligned Diffusion Forcing with test-time Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion to address drift and exposure bias in VLA policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon robot manipulation tasks are challenging for Vision-Language-Action policies due to drift and exposure bias, where small geometric errors compound across stages and there's no mechanism to allocate extra compute for tight clearances.

Method: FORGE-Tree couples a stage-aligned Diffusion Forcing head with test-time Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion. It partially denoises target segments while keeping other tokens frozen, using scene graphs for priors and geometry relation-aware scoring for rollouts.

Result: Evaluation on LIBERO shows FORGE-Tree improves success rate by 13.4 to 17.2 percentage points over native VLA baselines (OpenVLA and Octo-Base), with consistent gains under comparable compute budgets, especially on long-horizon variants.

Conclusion: FORGE-Tree effectively addresses drift and exposure bias in VLA policies through tree-structured denoising that scales with search budget while preserving executed prefixes, significantly improving long-horizon manipulation performance.

Abstract: Long-horizon robot manipulation tasks remain challenging for
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies due to drift and exposure bias, often
denoise the entire trajectory with fixed hyperparameters, causing small
geometric errors to compound across stages and offering no mechanism to
allocate extra test-time compute where clearances are tight. To address these
challenges, we introduce FORGE-Tree, a plug-in control layer that couples a
stage-aligned Diffusion Forcing (DF) head with test-time Monte Carlo Tree
Diffusion (MCTD). With a frozen VLA encoder, DF aligns timesteps to subtask
stages; during inference we partially denoise only a target segment while
keeping other tokens frozen, turning trajectory refinement into a sequence of
local edits. We then apply Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion to select the next
segment to refine. A scene graph supplies priors for expansion and geometry
relation-aware scoring for rollouts, yielding tree-structured denoising whose
performance scales with search budget while preserving the executed prefix.
Evaluation on LIBERO, FORGE-Tree improves success rate by 13.4 to 17.2 pp over

### [217] [Avi: Action from Volumetric Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21746)
*Harris Song,Long Le*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Avi is a 3D Vision-Language-Action architecture that reframes robotic action generation as 3D perception and spatial reasoning rather than policy learning, using point clouds and geometric transformations to compute actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models operate on 2D visual inputs and require end-to-end training on task-specific policies, which limits generalization and robustness to environmental variations like occlusions and viewpoint changes.

Method: Avi leverages 3D point clouds and language-grounded scene understanding through a 3D Multi-modal Large Language Model, generating next point clouds and explicitly calculating actions via classical geometric transformations without training on action tokens.

Result: The approach enables generalizable behaviors that are robust to occlusions, camera pose variations, and viewpoint changes, bridging high-level language instructions with low-level actuation.

Conclusion: 3D vision-language reasoning shows potential as a foundation for scalable, robust robotic systems by treating robotic decision-making as structured reasoning over 3D representations.

Abstract: We propose Avi, a novel 3D Vision-Language-Action (VLA) architecture that
reframes robotic action generation as a problem of 3D perception and spatial
reasoning, rather than low-level policy learning. While existing VLA models
primarily operate on 2D visual inputs and are trained end-to-end on
task-specific action policies, Avi leverages 3D point clouds and
language-grounded scene understanding to compute actions through classical
geometric transformations. Most notably, Avi does not train on previous action
tokens, rather, we build upon a 3D Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to
generate the next point cloud and explicitly calculate the actions through
classical transformations. This approach enables generalizable behaviors that
are robust to occlusions, camera pose variations, and changes in viewpoint. By
treating the robotic decision-making process as a structured reasoning task
over 3D representations, Avi bridges the gap between high-level language
instructions and low-level actuation without requiring opaque policy learning.
Our preliminary results highlight the potential of 3D vision-language reasoning
as a foundation for scalable, robust robotic systems. Check it out at

TL;DR: J-ORA is a Japanese multimodal dataset with detailed object attribute annotations for robot perception tasks, showing that object attributes improve VLM performance but open-source models still lag behind proprietary ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in robot perception by providing detailed object attribute annotations within Japanese human-robot dialogue scenarios, addressing the need for rich, context-sensitive attribute annotations in dynamic environments.

Method: Created J-ORA dataset with comprehensive object attribute templates (category, color, shape, size, material, spatial relations) and evaluated both proprietary and open-source Vision Language Models on three perception tasks: object identification, reference resolution, and next-action prediction.

Result: Incorporating detailed object attributes substantially improves multimodal perception performance compared to without attributes. However, there's still a performance gap between proprietary and open-source VLMs. Analysis of object affordances shows varying abilities in understanding object functionality and contextual relationships across different VLMs.

Conclusion: Rich, context-sensitive attribute annotations are crucial for advancing robot perception in dynamic environments, and the J-ORA dataset provides valuable resources for this purpose while highlighting current limitations in VLM capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce J-ORA, a novel multimodal dataset that bridges the gap in robot
perception by providing detailed object attribute annotations within Japanese
human-robot dialogue scenarios. J-ORA is designed to support three critical
perception tasks, object identification, reference resolution, and next-action
prediction, by leveraging a comprehensive template of attributes (e.g.,
category, color, shape, size, material, and spatial relations). Extensive
evaluations with both proprietary and open-source Vision Language Models (VLMs)
reveal that incorporating detailed object attributes substantially improves
multimodal perception performance compared to without object attributes.
Despite the improvement, we find that there still exists a gap between
proprietary and open-source VLMs. In addition, our analysis of object
affordances demonstrates varying abilities in understanding object

Abstract: By 2050, the global demand for assistive care is expected to reach 3.5
billion people, far outpacing the availability of human caregivers. Existing
robotic solutions remain expensive and require technical expertise, limiting
accessibility. This work introduces a low-cost robotic arm for assistive tasks
such as feeding, cleaning spills, and fetching medicine. The system uses
imitation learning from demonstration videos, requiring no task-specific
programming or manual labeling. The robot consists of six servo motors, dual

leader arm yielded 50,000 video frames across the three tasks. A novel Phased
Action Chunking Transformer (PACT) captures temporal dependencies and segments

*Van Nam Dinh*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Comprehensive benchmarking study of quadratic programming (QP) solvers for legged robotics, analyzing four algorithmic approaches and providing practical guidance for solver selection based on speed, accuracy, and energy efficiency trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: QP underpins real-time robotics applications like inverse dynamics, MPC, and whole-body control in legged locomotion and manipulation, requiring reliable solutions under tight timing, energy, and computational constraints on embedded platforms.

Method: Formulated standard convex QP and classified solvers into four principal approaches: interior-point methods, active-set strategies, operator splitting schemes, and augmented Lagrangian approaches. Evaluated performance using public benchmarks focusing on computation time, constraint satisfaction, and robustness under perturbations.

Result: Performance analysis revealed specific solver-task-hardware synergies: sparse interior-point methods excel for long-horizon MPC, while dense active-set methods are optimal for high-frequency whole-body control. Feature tables and comparisons provide practical guidance for solver selection.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the importance of matching solver characteristics to specific tasks and hardware constraints to advance agile, autonomous legged systems, with emerging extensions to nonconvex and distributed QP problems.

Abstract: Quadratic programming (QP) underpins real-time robotics by enabling
efficient, constrained optimization in state estimation, motion planning, and
control. In legged locomotion and manipulation, essential modules like inverse
dynamics, Model Predictive Control (MPC), and Whole-Body Control (WBC) are
inherently QP-based, demanding reliable solutions amid tight timing, energy,
and computational limits on embedded platforms. This paper presents a
comprehensive analysis and benchmarking study of cutting-edge QP solvers for
legged robotics. We begin by formulating the standard convex QP and classify
solvers into four principal algorithmic approaches, including interior-point
methods, active-set strategies, operator splitting schemes, and augmented
Lagrangian approaches. Each solver is examined in terms of algorithmic
structure, computational characteristics, and its ability to exploit problem
structure and warm-starting. Performance is evaluated using publicly available
benchmarks, focusing on metrics such as computation time, constraint
satisfaction, and robustness under perturbations. Feature tables and
comparisons yield practical guidance for solver selection, underscoring
trade-offs in speed, accuracy, and energy efficiency. Our findings emphasize
the synergy between solver, task, and hardware, sparse IPMs for long-horizon
MPC, and dense active-set for high frequency WBC to advance agile, autonomous
legged systems, with emerging extensions to nonconvex and distributed QP.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VITA-E is a novel embodied interaction framework that enables concurrent observation, speech, and action with real-time interruption handling through a dual-model architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models have rigid, static interaction paradigms that lack concurrency and real-time interruption capabilities, hindering seamless embodied collaboration.

Method: Uses dual-model architecture with Active and Standby VLA models for concurrent operation, plus a 'model-as-controller' paradigm where VLM generates special tokens as system commands.

Result: Achieves high success rate on emergency stops and speech interruptions while successfully performing concurrent speech and action on physical humanoid platform.

Conclusion: Represents significant step towards more natural and capable embodied assistants with human-like multitasking capabilities.

Abstract: Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are often constrained by a rigid,
static interaction paradigm, which lacks the ability to see, hear, speak, and
act concurrently as well as handle real-time user interruptions dynamically.
This hinders seamless embodied collaboration, resulting in an inflexible and
unresponsive user experience. To address these limitations, we introduce
VITA-E, a novel embodied interaction framework designed for both behavioral
concurrency and nearly real-time interruption. The core of our approach is a
dual-model architecture where two parallel VLA instances operate as an ``Active
Model'' and a ``Standby Model'', allowing the embodied agent to observe its
environment, listen to user speech, provide verbal responses, and execute
actions, all concurrently and interruptibly, mimicking human-like multitasking
capabilities. We further propose a ``model-as-controller'' paradigm, where we
fine-tune the VLM to generate special tokens that serve as direct system-level
commands, coupling the model's reasoning with the system's behavior.
Experiments conducted on a physical humanoid platform demonstrate that VITA-E
can reliably handle complex interactive scenarios. Our framework is compatible
with various dual-system VLA models, achieving an extremely high success rate
on emergency stops and speech interruptions while also successfully performing
concurrent speech and action. This represents a significant step towards more
natural and capable embodied assistants.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper surveys calibration techniques for Stewart-Gough platforms (hexapod robots), focusing on inverse kinematics-based methods that improve position and orientation accuracy by addressing kinematic, structural, and environmental errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stewart-Gough platforms are used in critical applications requiring micro/nano-level precision in 3D space, but they must be more accurate than application requirements, making proper calibration crucial for precise, complicated, and repeatable motions.

Method: The survey reviews various calibration approaches including using external instruments, constraining system motions, and employing extra sensors for auto/self-calibration, with emphasis on inverse kinematics-based methods that are simpler than forward kinematics approaches.

Result: Researchers focused on improving platform accuracy by considering errors from kinematic, structural, and environmental sources, though most calibrations were conducted under no-load conditions.

Conclusion: The study provides a comprehensive review of current calibration methodologies for Stewart-Gough platforms, highlighting the processes and error sources considered, with inverse kinematics proving more practical than forward kinematics for calibration tasks.

Abstract: Researchers have studied Stewart-Gough platforms, also known as Gough-Stewart
platforms or hexapod platforms extensively for their inherent fine control
characteristics. Their studies led to the potential deployment opportunities of
Stewart-Gough Platforms in many critical applications such as the medical
field, engineering machines, space research, electronic chip manufacturing,
automobile manufacturing, etc. Some of these applications need micro and
nano-level movement control in 3D space for the motions to be precise,
complicated, and repeatable; a Stewart-Gough platform fulfills these challenges
smartly. For this, the platform must be more accurate than the specified
application accuracy level and thus proper calibration for a parallel robot is
crucial. Forward kinematics-based calibration for these hexapod machines
becomes unnecessarily complex and inverse kinematics complete this task with
much ease. To experiment with different calibration techniques, various
calibration approaches were implemented by using external instruments,
constraining one or more motions of the system, and using extra sensors for
auto or self-calibration. This survey paid attention to those key
methodologies, their outcome, and important details related to inverse
kinematic-based parallel robot calibrations. It was observed during this study
that the researchers focused on improving the accuracy of the platform position
and orientation considering the errors contributed by one source or multiple
sources. The error sources considered are mainly kinematic and structural, in
some cases, environmental factors also are reviewed, however, those
calibrations are done under no-load conditions. This study aims to review the
present state of the art in this field and highlight the processes and errors
considered for the calibration of Stewart-Gough platforms.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Butter-Bench is a benchmark evaluating LLM-controlled robots for practical intelligence in physical world navigation, showing humans (95%) significantly outperform best LLMs (40%) on tasks requiring multi-step spatial planning and social understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate large language models' practical intelligence in navigating real-world physical environments, as current robotic systems use hierarchical architectures with LLMs for high-level reasoning but their actual performance in practical tasks remains unclear.

Method: Created Butter-Bench benchmark that isolates and evaluates the LLM component from Vision Language Action models in robotic systems, testing practical intelligence through tasks involving physical world navigation.

Result: Humans significantly outperform LLMs with mean human score of 95% vs best LLM score of 40%. LLMs struggle most with multi-step spatial planning and social understanding. Fine-tuning for embodied reasoning does not improve performance.

Conclusion: Despite LLMs surpassing humans in analytical intelligence tasks, they still lag significantly in practical intelligence required for real-world physical navigation, particularly in spatial planning and social understanding domains.

Abstract: We present Butter-Bench, a benchmark evaluating large language model (LLM)
controlled robots for practical intelligence, defined as the ability to
navigate the messiness of the physical world. Current state-of-the-art robotic
systems use a hierarchical architecture with LLMs in charge of high-level
reasoning, and a Vision Language Action (VLA) model for low-level control.
Butter-Bench evaluates the LLM part in isolation from the VLA. Although LLMs
have repeatedly surpassed humans in evaluations requiring analytical
intelligence, we find humans still outperform LLMs on Butter-Bench. The best
LLMs score 40% on Butter-Bench, while the mean human score is 95%. LLMs
struggled the most with multi-step spatial planning and social understanding.
We also evaluate LLMs that are fine-tuned for embodied reasoning and conclude
that this training does not improve their score on Butter-Bench.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework for UAV trajectory planning that embeds dynamics, wind disturbances, and obstacle avoidance, outperforming traditional methods like A* and Kino-RRT* in energy efficiency, smoothness, and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional UAV trajectory planners (A*, kinodynamic RRT*) produce suboptimal or non-smooth paths due to discretization and sampling limitations, especially in dynamic wind fields where energy efficiency and safety are critical.

Method: Developed a physics-informed neural network (PINN) that embeds UAV dynamics, wind disturbances, and obstacle avoidance directly into learning. The PINN learns feasible trajectories without supervised data by minimizing physical residuals and risk-aware objectives.

Result: Comparative simulations show the PINN method outperforms A* and Kino-RRT* in control energy consumption, trajectory smoothness, and safety margins, while maintaining similar flight efficiency.

Conclusion: Physics-informed learning provides a scalable framework that unifies model-based and data-driven planning, offering physically consistent trajectory optimization for UAVs operating in challenging wind environments.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in dynamic wind fields must
generate safe and energy-efficient trajectories under physical and
environmental constraints. Traditional planners, such as A* and kinodynamic
RRT*, often yield suboptimal or non-smooth paths due to discretization and
sampling limitations. This paper presents a physics-informed neural network
(PINN) framework that embeds UAV dynamics, wind disturbances, and obstacle
avoidance directly into the learning process. Without requiring supervised
data, the PINN learns dynamically feasible and collision-free trajectories by
minimizing physical residuals and risk-aware objectives. Comparative
simulations show that the proposed method outperforms A* and Kino-RRT* in
control energy, smoothness, and safety margin, while maintaining similar flight
efficiency. The results highlight the potential of physics-informed learning to
unify model-based and data-driven planning, providing a scalable and physically
consistent framework for UAV trajectory optimization.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes genetic denoising, a population-based sampling method that enables diffusion policies to achieve state-of-the-art robotic manipulation performance with only 2-5 neural function evaluations by tailoring the denoising process to action distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have been directly transferred from vision tasks to control domains without adaptation, despite the different characteristics of embodied AI tasks which have structured, low-dimensional action distributions.

Method: Proposes genetic denoising - a population-based sampling strategy that selects denoising trajectories with low out-of-distribution risk, specifically tailored to the characteristics of action distributions in robotic manipulation.

Result: The method solves challenging robotic manipulation tasks with only 2 NFE while improving or matching performance. Evaluated across 14 tasks from D4RL and Robomimic, it consistently outperforms standard diffusion policies with up to 20% performance gains using significantly fewer inference steps.

Conclusion: By adapting diffusion model inference strategies to the specific characteristics of embodied AI tasks, diffusion policies can operate effectively with very few neural function evaluations while maintaining or improving performance.

Abstract: Diffusion models, such as diffusion policy, have achieved state-of-the-art
results in robotic manipulation by imitating expert demonstrations. While
diffusion models were originally developed for vision tasks like image and
video generation, many of their inference strategies have been directly
transferred to control domains without adaptation. In this work, we show that
by tailoring the denoising process to the specific characteristics of embodied
AI tasks -- particularly structured, low-dimensional nature of action
distributions -- diffusion policies can operate effectively with as few as 5
neural function evaluations (NFE).
  Building on this insight, we propose a population-based sampling strategy,
genetic denoising, which enhances both performance and stability by selecting
denoising trajectories with low out-of-distribution risk. Our method solves
challenging tasks with only 2 NFE while improving or matching performance. We
evaluate our approach across 14 robotic manipulation tasks from D4RL and
Robomimic, spanning multiple action horizons and inference budgets. In over 2
million evaluations, our method consistently outperforms standard
diffusion-based policies, achieving up to 20\% performance gains with
significantly fewer inference steps.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how key parameters affect frontal plane stability in bipedal systems and proposes a method to predict the minimum stride frequency needed for stable oscillations using feedforward leg retraction/extension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited understanding of how mass, stiffness, leg length, and hip width affect stability and minimum stride frequency in bipedal systems, despite the potential for feedforward stabilization to reduce control effort and increase robustness.

Method: Analyze how individual model parameters and natural frequency influence minimum stride frequency, propose prediction method, and compare predicted vs actual stride frequencies for randomly generated models.

Result: The study provides better understanding of frontal plane stability mechanisms and how feedforward stabilization can reduce control effort.

Conclusion: The findings enable leveraging feedforward stabilization to reduce control effort and energy expenditure while increasing locomotion robustness in bipedal systems.

Abstract: Stability of bipedal systems in frontal plane is affected by the hip offset,
to the extent that adjusting stride time using feedforward retraction and
extension of the legs can lead to stable oscillations without feedback control.
This feedforward stabilization can be leveraged to reduce the control effort
and energy expenditure and increase the locomotion robustness. However, there
is limited understanding of how key parameters, such as mass, stiffness, leg
length, and hip width, affect stability and the minimum stride frequency needed
to maintain it. This study aims to address these gaps through analyzing how
individual model parameters and the system's natural frequency influence the
minimum stride frequency required to maintain a stable cycle. We propose a
method to predict the minimum stride frequency, and compare the predicted
stride frequencies with actual values for randomly generated models. The
findings of this work provide a better understanding of the frontal plane
stability mechanisms and how feedforward stabilization can be leveraged to
reduce the control effort.

Abstract: Robotic manipulators are increasingly used to assist individuals with

system's effectiveness in enhancing intuitiveness and accessibility,
underscoring its practical significance for assistive robotics applications.

TL;DR: LT-Exosense is a vision-based multi-session mapping system for self-balancing exoskeletons that enables long-term autonomous navigation by incrementally building persistent maps and adapting to environmental changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-balancing exoskeletons need reliable perception systems for long-term operation in changing environments to support individuals with lower-limb disabilities.

Method: The system extends single-session mapping by incrementally fusing spatial knowledge across multiple sessions, detecting environmental changes, and updating a persistent global map to enable adaptive path planning.

Result: Real-world experiments show a scalable multi-session map with average point-to-point error below 5 cm compared to ground-truth laser scans, with demonstrated adaptive path planning in changing indoor environments.

Conclusion: LT-Exosense provides an effective vision-centric solution for long-term autonomous navigation of exoskeletons, capable of handling dynamic environmental changes through persistent mapping and intelligent path planning.

Abstract: Self-balancing exoskeletons offer a promising mobility solution for
individuals with lower-limb disabilities. For reliable long-term operation,
these exoskeletons require a perception system that is effective in changing
environments. In this work, we introduce LT-Exosense, a vision-centric,
multi-session mapping system designed to support long-term (semi)-autonomous
navigation for exoskeleton users. LT-Exosense extends single-session mapping
capabilities by incrementally fusing spatial knowledge across multiple
sessions, detecting environmental changes, and updating a persistent global
map. This representation enables intelligent path planning, which can adapt to
newly observed obstacles and can recover previous routes when obstructions are
removed. We validate LT-Exosense through several real-world experiments,
demonstrating a scalable multi-session map that achieves an average
point-to-point error below 5 cm when compared to ground-truth laser scans. We
also illustrate the potential application of adaptive path planning in
dynamically changing indoor environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Action Coherence Guidance (ACG) is a training-free test-time guidance algorithm that improves action coherence in Vision-Language-Action models by reducing noise from human demonstrations, leading to better performance in fine-grained manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion and flow matching models used as robot policies are sensitive to noise in human demonstrations (jerks, pauses, jitter), which reduces action coherence and causes instability and trajectory drift during deployment, especially problematic in fine-grained manipulation where precision is crucial.

Method: Action Coherence Guidance (ACG) - a training-free test-time guidance algorithm that improves action coherence in VLA models without requiring additional training.

Result: ACG consistently improves action coherence and boosts success rates across diverse manipulation tasks on RoboCasa, DexMimicGen, and real-world SO-101 tasks.

Conclusion: ACG effectively addresses the action coherence problem in VLA models, providing performance gains without the need for retraining, making it particularly valuable for fine-grained manipulation tasks requiring high precision.

Abstract: Diffusion and flow matching models have emerged as powerful robot policies,
enabling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to generalize across diverse
scenes and instructions. Yet, when trained via imitation learning, their high
generative capacity makes them sensitive to noise in human demonstrations:
jerks, pauses, and jitter which reduce action coherence. Reduced action
coherence causes instability and trajectory drift during deployment, failures
that are catastrophic in fine-grained manipulation where precision is crucial.
In this paper, we present Action Coherence Guidance (ACG) for VLA models, a
training-free test-time guidance algorithm that improves action coherence and
thereby yields performance gains. Evaluated on RoboCasa, DexMimicGen, and
real-world SO-101 tasks, ACG consistently improves action coherence and boosts
success rates across diverse manipulation tasks. Code and project page are

*Weixian Qian,Sebastian Schroder,Yao Deng,Jiaohong Yao,Linfeng Liang,Xiao Cheng,Richard Han,Xi Zheng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NeuroSymLand is a neuro-symbolic framework for autonomous UAV landing that combines LLM-generated symbolic reasoning with foundation model perception to achieve robust, interpretable landing decisions in unstructured environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-based or deep learning approaches for autonomous UAV landing struggle with covariate shift and lack interpretability, limiting their reliability in unstructured environments for critical applications like emergency response and surveillance.

Method: Uses two complementary pipelines: (1) offline LLM synthesis of Scallop code from landing scenarios with human refinement, and (2) online foundation model segmentation generating probabilistic facts for real-time symbolic reasoning via semantic scene graphs with geometric attribute computation.

Result: Achieves higher accuracy, stronger robustness to covariate shift, and superior efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines across datasets, simulations, and real UAV hardware.

Conclusion: NeuroSymLand advances UAV safety and reliability by combining perceptual strengths of foundation models with interpretable symbolic reasoning, enabling trustworthy autonomous landing in challenging unstructured environments.

Abstract: Autonomous landing in unstructured (cluttered, uneven, and map-poor)
environments is a core requirement for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), yet
purely vision-based or deep learning models often falter under covariate shift
and provide limited interpretability. We propose NeuroSymLand, a neuro-symbolic
framework that tightly couples two complementary pipelines: (i) an offline
pipeline, where Large Language Models (LLMs) and human-in-the-loop refinement
synthesize Scallop code from diverse landing scenarios, distilling
generalizable and verifiable symbolic knowledge; and (ii) an online pipeline,
where a compact foundation-based semantic segmentation model generates
probabilistic Scallop facts that are composed into semantic scene graphs for
real-time deductive reasoning. This design combines the perceptual strengths of
lightweight foundation models with the interpretability and verifiability of
symbolic reasoning. Node attributes (e.g., flatness, area) and edge relations
(adjacency, containment, proximity) are computed with geometric routines rather
than learned, avoiding the data dependence and latency of train-time graph
builders. The resulting Scallop program encodes landing principles (avoid water
and obstacles; prefer large, flat, accessible regions) and yields calibrated
safety scores with ranked Regions of Interest (ROIs) and human-readable
justifications. Extensive evaluations across datasets, diverse simulation maps,
and real UAV hardware show that NeuroSymLand achieves higher accuracy, stronger
robustness to covariate shift, and superior efficiency compared with
state-of-the-art baselines, while advancing UAV safety and reliability in
emergency response, surveillance, and delivery missions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LIO algorithms fail in dynamic environments due to static-world assumptions, especially when dynamic objects dominate geometrically sparse scenes. There's a fundamental challenge where accurate localization requires reliable static feature identification, yet distinguishing dynamic objects needs precise pose estimation.

Result: Experimental evaluations show significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art LIO systems in challenging dynamic environments with limited geometric structure.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses the circular dependency problem in dynamic LIO by directly integrating dynamic awareness into the registration process, enabling robust performance in challenging dynamic environments.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of Lidar-Inertial Odometry (LIO) in
dynamic environments, where conventional methods often fail due to their
static-world assumptions. Traditional LIO algorithms perform poorly when
dynamic objects dominate the scenes, particularly in geometrically sparse

accurate localization requires a reliable identification of static features,
yet distinguishing dynamic objects necessitates precise pose estimation. Our
solution breaks this circular dependency by integrating dynamic awareness

Conclusion: Humanoid co-design is critical for fall recovery performance, with morphology optimization playing a substantial role in overall improvements.

Abstract: Humanoid robots represent a central frontier in embodied intelligence, as
their anthropomorphic form enables natural deployment in humans' workspace.
Brain-body co-design for humanoids presents a promising approach to realizing
this potential by jointly optimizing control policies and physical morphology.
Within this context, fall recovery emerges as a critical capability. It not
only enhances safety and resilience but also integrates naturally with
locomotion systems, thereby advancing the autonomy of humanoids. In this paper,
we propose RoboCraft, a scalable humanoid co-design framework for fall recovery
that iteratively improves performance through the coupled updates of control
policy and morphology. A shared policy pretrained across multiple designs is
progressively finetuned on high-performing morphologies, enabling efficient
adaptation without retraining from scratch. Concurrently, morphology search is
guided by human-inspired priors and optimization algorithms, supported by a
priority buffer that balances reevaluation of promising candidates with the
exploration of novel designs. Experiments show that \ourmethod{} achieves an
average performance gain of 44.55% on seven public humanoid robots, with
morphology optimization drives at least 40% of improvements in co-designing
four humanoid robots, underscoring the critical role of humanoid co-design.

*Enyi Wang,Zhen Deng,Chuanchuan Pan,Bingwei He,Jianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A deep learning approach using spatiotemporal neural networks to estimate 3D shapes of flexible continuum robots under external loads, combining tendon displacement data and RGB images to generate point clouds with high precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accurately estimate the 3D shape of flexible continuum robots when they are subjected to external loads, which is challenging for traditional methods.

Method: Uses a spatiotemporal neural network architecture that fuses multi-modal inputs (current/historical tendon displacement data and RGB images) with recurrent neural modules for temporal features, encoding modules for spatial features, and multi-modal fusion. Fits Bézier curves to predicted point clouds for continuous 3D reconstruction.

Result: Achieves high precision with mean shape estimation errors of 0.08 mm (unloaded) and 0.22 mm (loaded), outperforming state-of-the-art methods in shape sensing for tendon-driven continuum robots (TDCRs).

Conclusion: Deep learning-based spatiotemporal data fusion is effective for precise shape estimation of continuum robots under loading conditions.

Abstract: This paper presents a learning-based approach for accurately estimating the
3D shape of flexible continuum robots subjected to external loads. The proposed
method introduces a spatiotemporal neural network architecture that fuses
multi-modal inputs, including current and historical tendon displacement data
and RGB images, to generate point clouds representing the robot's deformed
configuration. The network integrates a recurrent neural module for temporal
feature extraction, an encoding module for spatial feature extraction, and a
multi-modal fusion module to combine spatial features extracted from visual
data with temporal dependencies from historical actuator inputs. Continuous 3D
shape reconstruction is achieved by fitting B\'ezier curves to the predicted
point clouds. Experimental validation demonstrates that our approach achieves
high precision, with mean shape estimation errors of 0.08 mm (unloaded) and
0.22 mm (loaded), outperforming state-of-the-art methods in shape sensing for
TDCRs. The results validate the efficacy of deep learning-based spatiotemporal

*Seyed Ahmad Hosseini Miangoleh,Amin Jalal Aghdasian,Farzaneh Abdollahi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: BLIP-FusePPO is a multimodal RL framework that fuses VLM semantic embeddings with geometric states, LiDAR, and PID control feedback for autonomous lane-keeping, improving stability and adaptability over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more robust autonomous lane-keeping system by combining high-level scene understanding from vision-language models with low-level control signals, enabling the agent to learn driving rules that are both context-aware and interpretable.

Method: Directly fuses semantic embeddings from vision-language models with geometric states, LiDAR observations, and PID control feedback in the observation space, using a hybrid reward function with semantic alignment, lane-keeping accuracy, obstacle avoidance, and speed regulation.

Result: The proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art vision-based and multimodal RL baselines in lane-keeping stability and adaptability across various challenging driving scenarios.

Conclusion: BLIP-FusePPO demonstrates that directly embedding semantic features into state representations rather than using semantic models only for reward shaping reduces runtime inference costs and provides continuous semantic guidance, leading to more robust autonomous driving performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Bootstrapped Language-Image Pretraining-driven
Fused State Representation in Proximal Policy Optimization (BLIP-FusePPO), a
novel multimodal reinforcement learning (RL) framework for autonomous
lane-keeping (LK), in which semantic embeddings generated by a vision-language
model (VLM) are directly fused with geometric states, LiDAR observations, and
Proportional-Integral-Derivative-based (PID) control feedback within the agent
observation space. The proposed method lets the agent learn driving rules that
are aware of their surroundings and easy to understand by combining high-level
scene understanding from the VLM with low-level control and spatial signals.
Our architecture brings together semantic, geometric, and control-aware
representations to make policy learning more robust. A hybrid reward function
that includes semantic alignment, LK accuracy, obstacle avoidance, and speed
regulation helps learning to be more efficient and generalizable. Our method is
different from the approaches that only use semantic models to shape rewards.
Instead, it directly embeds semantic features into the state representation.
This cuts down on expensive runtime inference and makes sure that semantic
guidance is always available. The simulation results show that the proposed
model is better at LK stability and adaptability than the best vision-based and
multimodal RL baselines in a wide range of difficult driving situations. We
make our code publicly available.

*Mohammad Ali Labbaf Khaniki,Fateme Taroodi,Benyamin Safizadeh*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces MTLHRL, a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that addresses dimensionality, temporal abstraction, and stability issues in high-dimensional stochastic control systems using multi-timescale Lyapunov constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for controlling high-dimensional stochastic systems suffer from the curse of dimensionality, lack temporal abstraction, and often fail to ensure stochastic stability, which is critical in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and hyperchaotic systems.

Method: MTLHRL integrates hierarchical policies within a semi-Markov Decision Process with high-level strategic planning and low-level reactive control. It enforces stability using neural Lyapunov functions optimized via Lagrangian relaxation and multi-timescale actor-critic updates, with trust-region constraints and decoupled optimization.

Result: Extensive simulations on 8D hyperchaotic systems and 5-DOF robotic manipulators show MTLHRL significantly outperforms baselines in stability and performance, achieving lowest error indices (IAE: 3.912 in hyperchaotic control, IAE: 1.623 in robotics), faster convergence, and superior disturbance rejection.

Conclusion: MTLHRL provides a theoretically grounded and practically viable solution for robust control of complex stochastic systems, effectively addressing dimensionality, temporal abstraction, and stability challenges.

Abstract: Controlling high-dimensional stochastic systems, critical in robotics,
autonomous vehicles, and hyperchaotic systems, faces the curse of
dimensionality, lacks temporal abstraction, and often fails to ensure
stochastic stability. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces the
Multi-Timescale Lyapunov-Constrained Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning
(MTLHRL) framework. MTLHRL integrates a hierarchical policy within a
semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP), featuring a high-level policy for
strategic planning and a low-level policy for reactive control, which
effectively manages complex, multi-timescale decision-making and reduces
dimensionality overhead. Stability is rigorously enforced using a neural
Lyapunov function optimized via Lagrangian relaxation and multi-timescale
actor-critic updates, ensuring mean-square boundedness or asymptotic stability
in the face of stochastic dynamics. The framework promotes efficient and
reliable learning through trust-region constraints and decoupled optimization.
Extensive simulations on an 8D hyperchaotic system and a 5-DOF robotic
manipulator demonstrate MTLHRL's empirical superiority. It significantly
outperforms baseline methods in both stability and performance, recording the
lowest error indices (e.g., Integral Absolute Error (IAE): 3.912 in
hyperchaotic control and IAE: 1.623 in robotics), achieving faster convergence,
and exhibiting superior disturbance rejection. MTLHRL offers a theoretically
grounded and practically viable solution for robust control of complex
stochastic systems.

Motivation: The scientific community lacks agreement on how to benchmark Social Robot Navigation, which hinders progress and may lead to conflicting conclusions due to the absence of standardized evaluation methods.

Method: Conducted a systematic review of 85 papers from IEEE Xplore (January 2020 to July 2025) focusing on benchmarking metrics, algorithms used, human survey methods, and how conclusions are drawn from benchmarking results.

Result: Identified and analyzed current benchmarking practices in Social Robot Navigation research, including the specific metrics, algorithms, and evaluation methodologies employed across the field during the specified period.

Conclusion: The review highlights the need for standardized benchmarking approaches in Social Robot Navigation to ensure consistent evaluation and facilitate meaningful progress in the field.

Abstract: Social Robot Navigation is the skill that allows robots to move efficiently
in human-populated environments while ensuring safety, comfort, and trust.
Unlike other areas of research, the scientific community has not yet achieved
an agreement on how Social Robot Navigation should be benchmarked. This is
notably important, as the lack of a de facto standard to benchmark Social Robot
Navigation can hinder the progress of the field and may lead to contradicting
conclusions. Motivated by this gap, we contribute with a short review focused
exclusively on benchmarking trends in the period from January 2020 to July
2025. Of the 130 papers identified by our search using IEEE Xplore, we analysed
the 85 papers that met the criteria of the review. This review addresses the
metrics used in the literature for benchmarking purposes, the algorithms
employed in such benchmarks, the use of human surveys for benchmarking, and how
conclusions are drawn from the benchmarking results, when applicable.

*Sourabh Karmakar,Cameron J. Turner*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A method to generate unique forward-kinematic solutions for Stewart platforms using inverse kinematics and modified Denavit-Hartenberg convention, eliminating the need for manual pose verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forward kinematics for parallel kinematic machines like Stewart platforms are complex and generate multiple solutions due to closed-loop structure, requiring manual verification which is impractical for real-time applications.

Method: Uses inverse kinematics to obtain valid workspace data and actuator lengths, then applies a simple iterative algorithm with modified Denavit-Hartenberg convention to solve forward kinematics.

Result: Generates a single feasible forward kinematic solution for each valid pose with solved DH parameters, eliminating the need for manual verification of solutions.

Conclusion: The method provides directly usable forward kinematic solutions for six degree of freedom materials testing systems, enabling high precision force control for characterizing additively manufactured materials under complex loading conditions.

Abstract: This paper presents a method to generate feasible, unique forward-kinematic
solutions for a general Stewart platform. This is done by using inverse
kinematics to obtain valid workspace data and corresponding actuator lengths
for the moving platform. For parallel kinematic machines, such as the Stewart
Platform, inverse kinematics are straight forward, but the forward kinematics
are complex and generates multiple solutions due to the closed loop structure
of the kinematic links. In this research, a simple iterative algorithm has been
used employing modified Denavit-Hartenberg convention. The outcome is
encouraging as this method generates a single feasible forward kinematic
solution for each valid pose with the solved DH parameters and unlike earlier
forward kinematics solutions, this unique solution does not need to be manually
verified. Therefore, the forward kinematic solutions can be used directly for
further calculations without the need for manual pose verification. This
capability is essential for the six degree of freedom materials testing system
developed by the authors in their laboratory. The developed system is aimed at
characterizing additively manufactured materials under complex combined
multiple loading conditions. The material characterization is done by enabling
high precision force control on the moving platform via in situ calibration of
the as-built kinematics of the Stewart Gough Platform.

*Ciera McFarland,Antonio Alvarez,Sarah Taher,Nathaniel Hanson,Margaret McGuinness*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper investigates how various design parameters affect the steerability of vine robots, finding that tip load, pressure, length, diameter, and fabrication method significantly impact maneuverability, with optimized robots outperforming ad hoc designs in mobility tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vine robots show promise for field applications like urban search and rescue, but their performance is constrained by sensor/tool weight and other design factors. Understanding how different parameters affect steerability is crucial for improving their practical utility.

Method: Conducted two experimental groups: (1) studied tip load, chamber pressure, length, and diameter in robots supporting themselves against gravity; (2) studied fabrication method and actuator-to-chamber pressure ratio in ground-supported robots.

Result: Steerability decreases with increasing tip load, is optimal at moderate chamber pressure, increases with length, and is unaffected by diameter. Exterior actuators curve at low pressure but saturate, while integrated actuators require higher pressure but achieve greater overall curvature.

Conclusion: Robots optimized using these design principles significantly outperform those with ad hoc parameters in mobility tasks requiring maximum upward and horizontal curvatures.

Abstract: Vine robots extend their tubular bodies by everting material from the tip,
enabling navigation in complex environments with a minimalist soft body.
Despite their promise for field applications, especially in the urban search
and rescue domain, performance is constrained by the weight of attached sensors
or tools, as well as other design and control choices. This work investigates
how tip load, pressure, length, diameter, and fabrication method shape vine
robot steerability--the ability to maneuver with controlled curvature--for
robots that steer with series pouch motor-style pneumatic actuators. We conduct
two groups of experiments: (1) studying tip load, chamber pressure, length, and
diameter in a robot supporting itself against gravity, and (2) studying
fabrication method and ratio of actuator to chamber pressure in a robot
supported on the ground. Results show that steerability decreases with
increasing tip load, is best at moderate chamber pressure, increases with
length, and is largely unaffected by diameter. Robots with actuators attached
on their exterior begin curving at low pressure ratios, but curvature saturates
at high pressure ratios; those with actuators integrated into the robot body
require higher pressure ratios to begin curving but achieve higher curvature
overall. We demonstrate that robots optimized with these principles outperform
those with ad hoc parameters in a mobility task that involves maximizing upward
and horizontal curvatures.

Motivation: Inspired by how army ants form temporary walls to prevent interference between foraging trails, aiming to replicate this emergent behavior in heterogeneous robotic swarms for spatial separation during concurrent tasks.

Method: Developed two controllers: 1) Finite-state machine (FSM) using encounter-triggered transitions to create rigid walls, 2) FSM integrated with Deep Q-Network (DQN) that dynamically optimizes separation through emergent "demilitarized zones".

Result: Both controllers reduced mixing between subgroups in simulation. The DQN-enhanced controller improved adaptability, reduced mixing by 40-50%, and achieved faster convergence compared to the FSM-only approach.

Conclusion: The DQN-enhanced controller demonstrates superior performance in maintaining spatial separation for robotic swarms, showing that machine learning integration can significantly improve adaptability and efficiency in decentralized swarm control systems.

Abstract: In natural systems, emergent structures often arise to balance competing
demands. Army ants, for example, form temporary "walls" that prevent
interference between foraging trails. Inspired by this behavior, we developed
two decentralized controllers for heterogeneous robotic swarms to maintain
spatial separation while executing concurrent tasks. The first is a
finite-state machine (FSM)-based controller that uses encounter-triggered
transitions to create rigid, stable walls. The second integrates FSM states
with a Deep Q-Network (DQN), dynamically optimizing separation through emergent
"demilitarized zones." In simulation, both controllers reduce mixing between
subgroups, with the DQN-enhanced controller improving adaptability and reducing
mixing by 40-50% while achieving faster convergence.

Method: The framework combines three key innovations: Structure-Preserving Robust Fusion (SP-RoFusion) that couples appearance, depth, and edge cues; adaptive tracking with residual balancing regularization; and a CLIP-based enhancement module activated under severe degradations.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on Replica, TUM, and real-world sequences demonstrate consistent improvements in trajectory accuracy and reconstruction quality compared to other 3DGS-SLAM systems, particularly under adverse imaging conditions.

Conclusion: RoGER-SLAM effectively addresses the limitations of existing 3DGS SLAM systems in challenging environments by leveraging robust fusion strategies and semantic enhancement, making it more reliable for real-world applications.

Abstract: The reliability of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is severely
constrained in environments where visual inputs suffer from noise and low
illumination. Although recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based SLAM
frameworks achieve high-fidelity mapping under clean conditions, they remain
vulnerable to compounded degradations that degrade mapping and tracking
performance. A key observation underlying our work is that the original 3DGS
rendering pipeline inherently behaves as an implicit low-pass filter,
attenuating high-frequency noise but also risking over-smoothing. Building on
this insight, we propose RoGER-SLAM, a robust 3DGS SLAM system tailored for
noise and low-light resilience. The framework integrates three innovations: a
Structure-Preserving Robust Fusion (SP-RoFusion) mechanism that couples
rendered appearance, depth, and edge cues; an adaptive tracking objective with
residual balancing regularization; and a Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining
(CLIP)-based enhancement module, selectively activated under compounded
degradations to restore semantic and structural fidelity. Comprehensive
experiments on Replica, TUM, and real-world sequences show that RoGER-SLAM
consistently improves trajectory accuracy and reconstruction quality compared
with other 3DGS-SLAM systems, especially under adverse imaging conditions.

*Shireen Kudukkil Manchingal,Armand Amaritei,Mihir Gohad,Maryam Sultana,Julian F. P. Kooij,Fabio Cuzzolin,Andrew Bradley*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This study integrates Random-Set Neural Networks (RS-NNs) into autonomous vehicle perception systems to provide explicit uncertainty quantification, enabling vehicles to dynamically adjust speed based on prediction confidence for improved safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicle perception systems are susceptible to errors from overconfident predictions in rare events or out-of-sample data, creating safety risks that need uncertainty-aware solutions.

Method: The study uses Random-Set Neural Networks (RS-NNs) that predict belief functions over sets of classes, integrated into a ROS-based autonomous racing vehicle software stack to classify road layout and quantify prediction uncertainty.

Result: RS-NNs achieved significantly higher accuracy and superior uncertainty calibration compared to traditional CNNs and Bayesian neural networks, enabling dynamic speed modulation - maintaining high speed during confident predictions and reducing speed in uncertain scenarios.

Conclusion: RS-NNs provide a practical solution for safer autonomous driving by enabling explicit uncertainty quantification that can be directly used for real-time safety-critical decision making in vehicle control systems.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicle (AV) perception systems have advanced rapidly in recent
years, providing vehicles with the ability to accurately interpret their
environment. Perception systems remain susceptible to errors caused by
overly-confident predictions in the case of rare events or out-of-sample data.
This study equips an autonomous vehicle with the ability to 'know when it is
uncertain', using an uncertainty-aware image classifier as part of the AV
software stack. Specifically, the study exploits the ability of Random-Set
Neural Networks (RS-NNs) to explicitly quantify prediction uncertainty. Unlike
traditional CNNs or Bayesian methods, RS-NNs predict belief functions over sets
of classes, allowing the system to identify and signal uncertainty clearly in
novel or ambiguous scenarios. The system is tested in a real-world autonomous
racing vehicle software stack, with the RS-NN classifying the layout of the
road ahead and providing the associated uncertainty of the prediction.
Performance of the RS-NN under a range of road conditions is compared against
traditional CNN and Bayesian neural networks, with the RS-NN achieving
significantly higher accuracy and superior uncertainty calibration. This
integration of RS-NNs into Robot Operating System (ROS)-based vehicle control
pipeline demonstrates that predictive uncertainty can dynamically modulate
vehicle speed, maintaining high-speed performance under confident predictions
while proactively improving safety through speed reductions in uncertain
scenarios. These results demonstrate the potential of uncertainty-aware neural
networks - in particular RS-NNs - as a practical solution for safer and more
robust autonomous driving.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RL-AVIST is a Reinforcement Learning framework for autonomous visual inspection of space targets, using model-based RL (DreamerV3) to enable 6-DOF spacecraft proximity maneuvers around orbital targets like the Lunar Gateway.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional control systems lack adaptability for complex on-orbit services like inspection and maintenance, especially under model uncertainties, multi-spacecraft configurations, and evolving mission contexts.

Method: Uses Space Robotics Bench (SRB) for high-fidelity 6-DOF spacecraft dynamics simulation. Trains agents with DreamerV3 (model-based RL) and compares with PPO and TD3 (model-free baselines). Evaluates both generalized agents (randomized velocity vectors) and specialized agents (fixed inspection orbits).

Result: Model-based RL demonstrates promising capabilities in trajectory fidelity and sample efficiency. Policies show robustness and generalization across multiple spacecraft morphologies and mission domains.

Conclusion: The framework paves the way for scalable, retrainable control solutions for future space operations, showing that model-based RL can effectively handle complex spacecraft proximity maneuvers.

Abstract: The growing need for autonomous on-orbit services such as inspection,
maintenance, and situational awareness calls for intelligent spacecraft capable
of complex maneuvers around large orbital targets. Traditional control systems
often fall short in adaptability, especially under model uncertainties,
multi-spacecraft configurations, or dynamically evolving mission contexts. This
paper introduces RL-AVIST, a Reinforcement Learning framework for Autonomous
Visual Inspection of Space Targets. Leveraging the Space Robotics Bench (SRB),
we simulate high-fidelity 6-DOF spacecraft dynamics and train agents using
DreamerV3, a state-of-the-art model-based RL algorithm, with PPO and TD3 as
model-free baselines. Our investigation focuses on 3D proximity maneuvering
tasks around targets such as the Lunar Gateway and other space assets. We
evaluate task performance under two complementary regimes: generalized agents
trained on randomized velocity vectors, and specialized agents trained to
follow fixed trajectories emulating known inspection orbits. Furthermore, we
assess the robustness and generalization of policies across multiple spacecraft
morphologies and mission domains. Results demonstrate that model-based RL
offers promising capabilities in trajectory fidelity, and sample efficiency,
paving the way for scalable, retrainable control solutions for future space
operations

*Wentao Guo,Wenzeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents two adaptive finger designs (SCAL-R and SCAL-L) that enable environment-adaptive pinch-lifting with minimal sensing and control, achieving robust grasping across various objects through different operating regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop robust grasping solutions that can adapt to different environments and object types with minimal sensing and control requirements, addressing the challenge of handling thin, low-profile, or weak-feature objects.

Method: Developed two complementary finger designs based on slot-constrained adaptive linkage (SCAL): SCAL-R (rotational-drive with active fingertip folding) and SCAL-L (linear-drive with passive opening). Both convert surface following into upward lifting while maintaining fingertip orientation. Fabricated via PLA-based 3D printing and validated through experiments on various objects.

Result: Both designs achieved consistent grasps across dozens of trials on small parts, boxes, jars, and tape rolls with limited tuning. Successfully demonstrated contact-preserving sliding, pinch-lifting, ramp negotiation, and handling of bulky objects through different grasping strategies.

Conclusion: The SCAL finger designs provide complementary operating regimes and offer a practical path to robust, environment-adaptive grasping with simple actuation, supported by quasi-static analysis that provides geometry-aware guidance for design and operation.

Abstract: This paper presents environment-adaptive pinch-lifting built on a
slot-constrained adaptive linkage (SCAL) and instantiated in two complementary
fingers: SCAL-R, a rotational-drive design with an active fingertip that folds
inward after contact to form an envelope, and SCAL-L, a linear-drive design
that passively opens on contact to span wide or weak-feature objects. Both
fingers convert surface following into an upward lifting branch while
maintaining fingertip orientation, enabling thin or low-profile targets to be
raised from supports with minimal sensing and control. Two-finger grippers are
fabricated via PLA-based 3D printing. Experiments evaluate (i)
contact-preserving sliding and pinch-lifting on tabletops, (ii) ramp
negotiation followed by lift, and (iii) handling of bulky objects via active
enveloping (SCAL-R) or contact-triggered passive opening (SCAL-L). Across
dozens of trials on small parts, boxes, jars, and tape rolls, both designs
achieve consistent grasps with limited tuning. A quasi-static analysis provides
closed-form fingertip-force models for linear parallel pinching and two-point
enveloping, offering geometry-aware guidance for design and operation. Overall,
the results indicate complementary operating regimes and a practical path to
robust, environment-adaptive grasping with simple actuation.

### [249] [Policies over Poses: Reinforcement Learning based Distributed Pose-Graph Optimization for Multi-Robot SLAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22740)
*Sai Krishna Ghanta,Ramviyas Parasuraman*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A distributed pose-graph optimization framework using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning that improves trajectory estimation in multi-robot SLAM by 37.5% over state-of-the-art methods while being 6X more efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional iterative approaches for distributed pose-graph optimization often converge to local minima and produce suboptimal estimates due to linearization of highly non-convex objectives.

Method: Cast distributed PGO as a partially observable Markov game using MARL, with graph partitioning, recurrent edge-conditioned GNN encoders with adaptive edge-gating, hybrid policies using prior action memory, and consensus schemes for global consistency.

Result: Reduces global objective by 37.5% more than state-of-the-art distributed PGO framework, enhances inference efficiency by at least 6X, and allows single learned policy to scale to larger robot teams without retraining.

Conclusion: The proposed MARL-based framework provides a scalable, outlier-robust solution for distributed planar PGO that significantly outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: We consider the distributed pose-graph optimization (PGO) problem, which is
fundamental in accurate trajectory estimation in multi-robot simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM). Conventional iterative approaches linearize a
highly non-convex optimization objective, requiring repeated solving of normal
equations, which often converge to local minima and thus produce suboptimal
estimates. We propose a scalable, outlier-robust distributed planar PGO
framework using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). We cast distributed
PGO as a partially observable Markov game defined on local pose-graphs, where
each action refines a single edge's pose estimate. A graph partitioner
decomposes the global pose graph, and each robot runs a recurrent
edge-conditioned Graph Neural Network (GNN) encoder with adaptive edge-gating
to denoise noisy edges. Robots sequentially refine poses through a hybrid
policy that utilizes prior action memory and graph embeddings. After local
graph correction, a consensus scheme reconciles inter-robot disagreements to
produce a globally consistent estimate. Our extensive evaluations on a
comprehensive suite of synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our
learned MARL-based actors reduce the global objective by an average of 37.5%
more than the state-of-the-art distributed PGO framework, while enhancing
inference efficiency by at least 6X. We also demonstrate that actor replication
allows a single learned policy to scale effortlessly to substantially larger
robot teams without any retraining. Code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TWC-SLAM is a multi-agent cooperative SLAM framework that integrates text semantics and WiFi signals to address challenges in similar indoor environments with repetitive structures like corridors and rooms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent cooperative SLAM faces significant inaccuracies in shared location identification in similar indoor environments with repetitive structures when using point cloud-based techniques alone.

Method: Uses FAST-LIO2 for single-agent front-end odometry, integrates text semantics and WiFi features for location identification and loop closure detection, and employs global mapping with point cloud alignment across agents.

Result: Evaluation on indoor dataset with similar corridors, rooms, and text signs shows TWC-SLAM significantly improves cooperative SLAM performance in complex environments with repetitive architectural features.

Conclusion: TWC-SLAM effectively enhances location identification and loop closure detection in repetitive indoor environments by leveraging text semantics and WiFi signals alongside traditional SLAM approaches.

Abstract: Multi-agent cooperative SLAM often encounters challenges in similar indoor
environments characterized by repetitive structures, such as corridors and
rooms. These challenges can lead to significant inaccuracies in shared location
identification when employing point cloud-based techniques. To mitigate these
issues, we introduce TWC-SLAM, a multi-agent cooperative SLAM framework that
integrates text semantics and WiFi signal features to enhance location
identification and loop closure detection. TWC-SLAM comprises a single-agent
front-end odometry module based on FAST-LIO2, a location identification and
loop closure detection module that leverages text semantics and WiFi features,
and a global mapping module. The agents are equipped with sensors capable of
capturing textual information and detecting WiFi signals. By correlating these
data sources, TWC-SLAM establishes a common location, facilitating point cloud
alignment across different agents' maps. Furthermore, the system employs loop
closure detection and optimization modules to achieve global optimization and
cohesive mapping. We evaluated our approach using an indoor dataset featuring
similar corridors, rooms, and text signs. The results demonstrate that TWC-SLAM
significantly improves the performance of cooperative SLAM systems in complex
environments with repetitive architectural features.

*Guangyao Shi,Yuwei Wu,Vijay Kumar,Gaurav S. Sukhatme*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PIP-LLM is a framework that combines PDDL-based team-level planning with IP-based robot-level planning to enable efficient multi-robot coordination for natural language commands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM+PDDL approaches struggle with multi-robot coordination due to brittle task decomposition, poor scalability, and low coordination efficiency.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Translate commands to team-level PDDL problems for abstract planning, 2) Convert plans to dependency graphs for IP-based task allocation that optimizes travel costs and workload while respecting robot capabilities.

Result: PIP-LLM improves plan success rate, reduces maximum and average travel costs, and achieves better load balancing compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: Separating planning from assignment allows PIP-LLM to avoid syntax-based decomposition pitfalls and scale to larger teams effectively.

Abstract: Enabling robot teams to execute natural language commands requires
translating high-level instructions into feasible, efficient multi-robot plans.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with Planning Domain Description
Language (PDDL) offer promise for single-robot scenarios, existing approaches
struggle with multi-robot coordination due to brittle task decomposition, poor
scalability, and low coordination efficiency.
  We introduce PIP-LLM, a language-based coordination framework that consists
of PDDL-based team-level planning and Integer Programming (IP) based
robot-level planning. PIP-LLMs first decomposes the command by translating the
command into a team-level PDDL problem and solves it to obtain a team-level
plan, abstracting away robot assignment. Each team-level action represents a
subtask to be finished by the team. Next, this plan is translated into a
dependency graph representing the subtasks' dependency structure. Such a
dependency graph is then used to guide the robot-level planning, in which each
subtask node will be formulated as an IP-based task allocation problem,
explicitly optimizing travel costs and workload while respecting robot
capabilities and user-defined constraints. This separation of planning from
assignment allows PIP-LLM to avoid the pitfalls of syntax-based decomposition
and scale to larger teams. Experiments across diverse tasks show that PIP-LLM
improves plan success rate, reduces maximum and average travel costs, and
achieves better load balancing compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simplified kinematic models fail to capture complex closed-loop dynamics of legged robots and their controllers, limiting predictions to simple planar motion and hindering autonomous navigation in cluttered environments.

Method: Neural observer with provable UUB guarantees for reliable latent state estimation from proprioceptive measurements, combined with computationally efficient predictor for rapid parallel evaluation of thousands of trajectories required by sampling-based planners.

Result: Successfully integrated neural predictor into MPPI-based planner on Vision 60 quadruped, demonstrating effective limb-aware motion planning in challenging narrow passages and over small objects during hardware experiments.

Conclusion: The framework provides robust foundation for high-performance, collision-aware planning on dynamic robotic platforms by accurately predicting full-body motion for safe autonomous navigation.

Abstract: Accurate full-body motion prediction is essential for the safe, autonomous
navigation of legged robots, enabling critical capabilities like limb-level
collision checking in cluttered environments. Simplified kinematic models often
fail to capture the complex, closed-loop dynamics of the robot and its
low-level controller, limiting their predictions to simple planar motion. To
address this, we present a learning-based observer-predictor framework that
accurately predicts this motion. Our method features a neural observer with
provable UUB guarantees that provides a reliable latent state estimate from a
history of proprioceptive measurements. This stable estimate initializes a
computationally efficient predictor, designed for the rapid, parallel
evaluation of thousands of potential trajectories required by modern
sampling-based planners. We validated the system by integrating our neural
predictor into an MPPI-based planner on a Vision 60 quadruped. Hardware
experiments successfully demonstrated effective, limb-aware motion planning in
a challenging, narrow passage and over small objects, highlighting our system's
ability to provide a robust foundation for high-performance, collision-aware
planning on dynamic robotic platforms.

TL;DR: Analytical Swarm Chemistry is a framework that combines engineering, agent-based modeling, and chemistry concepts to systematically analyze how swarm parameters influence emergent behaviors, enabling predictable swarm robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world swarm robotics deployments are rare due to difficulty predicting emergent behaviors from local interactions. Traditional engineering approaches design for idealized conditions, while agent-based studies are exploratory but lack systematic analysis.

Method: The framework integrates macrostate definitions with phase diagram analysis, treating swarm parameters like thermodynamic variables. It systematically explores parameter spaces to identify regions that produce specific emergent behaviors in minimally capable agents.

Result: The framework identified sufficient conditions for behaviors like milling and diffusion, and uncovered parameter space regions that reliably produce these behaviors. Preliminary real-robot validation confirmed these regions correspond to observable behaviors in practice.

Conclusion: Analytical Swarm Chemistry provides a principled, interpretable approach that lays groundwork for predictable and reliable emergent behavior in real-world swarm systems, bridging the gap between engineering design and emergent phenomena exploration.

Abstract: Swarm robotics has potential for a wide variety of applications, but
real-world deployments remain rare due to the difficulty of predicting emergent
behaviors arising from simple local interactions. Traditional engineering
approaches design controllers to achieve desired macroscopic outcomes under
idealized conditions, while agent-based and artificial life studies explore
emergent phenomena in a bottom-up, exploratory manner. In this work, we
introduce Analytical Swarm Chemistry, a framework that integrates concepts from
engineering, agent-based and artificial life research, and chemistry. This
framework combines macrostate definitions with phase diagram analysis to
systematically explore how swarm parameters influence emergent behavior.
Inspired by concepts from chemistry, the framework treats parameters like
thermodynamic variables, enabling visualization of regions in parameter space
that give rise to specific behaviors. Applying this framework to agents with
minimally viable capabilities, we identify sufficient conditions for behaviors
such as milling and diffusion and uncover regions of the parameter space that
reliably produce these behaviors. Preliminary validation on real robots
demonstrates that these regions correspond to observable behaviors in practice.
By providing a principled, interpretable approach, this framework lays the
groundwork for predictable and reliable emergent behavior in real-world swarm
systems.

*Nan Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Design of reconfigurable end-effectors for cable robots using springs and helical mechanisms to expand rotational workspace and eliminate redundancy, enabling pure kinematic control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address cable interference reducing rotational workspace and non-unique cable tension solutions in cable-driven robots with increased cables, which complicate kinematic control.

Method: Incorporating springs, helical-grooved shafts with matching nuts to convert linear motions into rotations, and bearings to provide additional rotational DOF, making the mechanism non-redundant.

Result: Expanded rotational workspace and elimination of redundancy, allowing robot motion to be controlled purely through kinematics without needing tension sensing and control.

Conclusion: The proposed reconfigurable end-effector design successfully addresses cable interference and tension solution issues in cable-driven robots, enabling simplified kinematic control.

Abstract: To enlarge the translational workspace of cable-driven robots, one common
approach is to increase the number of cables. However, this introduces two
challenges: (1) cable interference significantly reduces the rotational
workspace, and (2) the solution of tensions in cables becomes non-unique,
resulting in difficulties for kinematic control of the robot. In this work, we
design structurally simple reconfigurable end-effectors for cable robots. By
incorporating a spring, a helical-grooved shaft, and a matching nut, relative
linear motions between end-effector components are converted into relative
rotations, thereby expanding the rotational workspace of the mechanism.
Meanwhile, a bearing is introduced to provide an additional rotational degree
of freedom, making the mechanism non-redundant. As a result, the robot's motion
can be controlled purely through kinematics without additional tension sensing
and control.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes Adaptive Virtual Model Control (VMC) enhanced with Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning and Lyapunov-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enable stable, adaptable robotic control in uncertain environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional robotic control pipelines become rigid and brittle when exposed to perturbations or incomplete information. Traditional VMC has limitations due to fixed parameters and poor coordination among virtual components, which constrain adaptability and may undermine stability as tasks evolve.

Method: Combines LLM-based high-level reasoning for structured priors and coordination among virtual components with Lyapunov-based RL that enforces theoretical stability constraints. This preserves VMC's physical interpretability while enabling online adaptation.

Result: Extensive simulations on a 7-DoF Panda arm demonstrate effective balancing of competing objectives in dynamic tasks, achieving superior performance with improved coordination and sample efficiency.

Conclusion: The approach successfully integrates LLM guidance with Lyapunov-constrained adaptation, highlighting synergistic benefits for stable and adaptable robotic control in uncertain environments.

Abstract: Robotic arms are increasingly deployed in uncertain environments, yet
conventional control pipelines often become rigid and brittle when exposed to
perturbations or incomplete information. Virtual Model Control (VMC) enables
compliant behaviors by embedding virtual forces and mapping them into joint
torques, but its reliance on fixed parameters and limited coordination among
virtual components constrains adaptability and may undermine stability as task
objectives evolve. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive VMC with
Large Language Model (LLM)- and Lyapunov-Based Reinforcement Learning (RL),
which preserves the physical interpretability of VMC while supporting
stability-guaranteed online adaptation. The LLM provides structured priors and
high-level reasoning that enhance coordination among virtual components,
improve sample efficiency, and facilitate flexible adjustment to varying task
requirements. Complementarily, Lyapunov-based RL enforces theoretical stability
constraints, ensuring safe and reliable adaptation under uncertainty. Extensive
simulations on a 7-DoF Panda arm demonstrate that our approach effectively
balances competing objectives in dynamic tasks, achieving superior performance
while highlighting the synergistic benefits of LLM guidance and
Lyapunov-constrained adaptation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HyPerNav is a hybrid perception navigation method that integrates egocentric RGB-D observations with real-time top-down maps using Vision-Language Models to achieve state-of-the-art object navigation performance in unknown environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing object navigation methods typically focus on either egocentric observations or top-down maps separately, while humans naturally use both local and global perceptual information. The rapid advancement of Vision-Language Models provides an opportunity to integrate these complementary modalities.

Method: Proposed HyPerNav leverages VLMs' reasoning and vision-language understanding capabilities to jointly perceive both local egocentric RGB-D observations and global top-down map information for enhanced navigation decision-making.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance in both simulation evaluation and real-world validation against popular baselines. The hybrid perception approach captures richer cues and finds objects more effectively.

Conclusion: Hybrid perception combining egocentric observations and top-down maps significantly enhances object navigation performance, with ablation studies confirming that both perceptual modalities contribute to improved navigation effectiveness.

Abstract: Objective-oriented navigation(ObjNav) enables robot to navigate to target
object directly and autonomously in an unknown environment. Effective
perception in navigation in unknown environment is critical for autonomous
robots. While egocentric observations from RGB-D sensors provide abundant local
information, real-time top-down maps offer valuable global context for ObjNav.
Nevertheless, the majority of existing studies focus on a single source, seldom
integrating these two complementary perceptual modalities, despite the fact
that humans naturally attend to both. With the rapid advancement of
Vision-Language Models(VLMs), we propose Hybrid Perception Navigation
(HyPerNav), leveraging VLMs' strong reasoning and vision-language understanding
capabilities to jointly perceive both local and global information to enhance
the effectiveness and intelligence of navigation in unknown environments. In
both massive simulation evaluation and real-world validation, our methods
achieved state-of-the-art performance against popular baselines. Benefiting
from hybrid perception approach, our method captures richer cues and finds the
objects more effectively, by simultaneously leveraging information
understanding from egocentric observations and the top-down map. Our ablation
study further proved that either of the hybrid perception contributes to the
navigation performance.

an LQR scheme, compensates for the platform's nonlinear dynamics to achieve
precise motion control. In parallel, an Extended Kalman Filter fuses IMU and

*Zhuo Li,Junjia Liu,Dianxi Li,Tao Teng,Miao Li,Sylvain Calinon,Darwin Caldwell,Fei Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ManiDP is a diffusion-based imitation learning method that incorporates bimanual manipulability features to generate posture-optimized dual-arm trajectories for improved task compatibility in bimanual manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion methods for bimanual skill learning ignore posture-dependent task features, which are crucial for adapting dual-arm configurations to meet specific force and velocity requirements in dexterous manipulation.

Method: Extracts bimanual manipulability from expert demonstrations, encodes posture features using Riemannian-based probabilistic models, and incorporates these features into a conditional diffusion process to guide task-compatible bimanual motion generation.

Result: Achieves 39.33% increase in average manipulation success rate and 0.45 improvement in task compatibility compared to baseline methods across six real-world bimanual tasks.

Conclusion: Integrating posture-relevant robotic priors into bimanual skill diffusion enables human-like adaptability and dexterity, highlighting the importance of posture-aware learning in manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated the potential of diffusion models in robot
bimanual skill learning. However, existing methods ignore the learning of
posture-dependent task features, which are crucial for adapting dual-arm
configurations to meet specific force and velocity requirements in dexterous
bimanual manipulation. To address this limitation, we propose
Manipulability-Aware Diffusion Policy (ManiDP), a novel imitation learning
method that not only generates plausible bimanual trajectories, but also
optimizes dual-arm configurations to better satisfy posture-dependent task
requirements. ManiDP achieves this by extracting bimanual manipulability from
expert demonstrations and encoding the encapsulated posture features using
Riemannian-based probabilistic models. These encoded posture features are then
incorporated into a conditional diffusion process to guide the generation of
task-compatible bimanual motion sequences. We evaluate ManiDP on six real-world
bimanual tasks, where the experimental results demonstrate a 39.33$\%$ increase
in average manipulation success rate and a 0.45 improvement in task
compatibility compared to baseline methods. This work highlights the importance
of integrating posture-relevant robotic priors into bimanual skill diffusion to
enable human-like adaptability and dexterity.

*Oskar Natan,Jun Miura*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Seq-DeepIPC is a sequential end-to-end perception-to-control model for legged robot navigation that integrates multi-modal perception (RGB-D + GNSS) with temporal fusion, jointly predicting semantic segmentation and depth estimation for richer spatial features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance intelligent sensing for autonomous legged navigation by tightly integrating multi-modal perception with temporal fusion and control, extending end-to-end navigation beyond wheeled robots to more versatile systems.

Method: Uses EfficientNet-B0 encoder for efficient edge deployment, integrates RGB-D and GNSS data with temporal fusion, jointly predicts semantic segmentation and depth estimation, and computes heading from consecutive GNSS positions instead of noisy IMU.

Result: Achieves competitive or better results with reasonable model size; sequential inputs improve perception and control while other baselines don't benefit; GNSS-only heading is less reliable near tall buildings but robust in open areas.

Conclusion: Seq-DeepIPC successfully extends end-to-end navigation to legged robots with temporal awareness, demonstrating improved performance through sequential modeling and efficient multi-modal perception integration.

Abstract: We present Seq-DeepIPC, a sequential end-to-end perception-to-control model
for legged robot navigation in realworld environments. Seq-DeepIPC advances
intelligent sensing for autonomous legged navigation by tightly integrating
multi-modal perception (RGB-D + GNSS) with temporal fusion and control. The
model jointly predicts semantic segmentation and depth estimation, giving
richer spatial features for planning and control. For efficient deployment on
edge devices, we use EfficientNet-B0 as the encoder, reducing computation while
maintaining accuracy. Heading estimation is simplified by removing the noisy
IMU and instead computing the bearing angle directly from consecutive GNSS
positions. We collected a larger and more diverse dataset that includes both
road and grass terrains, and validated Seq-DeepIPC on a robot dog. Comparative
and ablation studies show that sequential inputs improve perception and control
in our models, while other baselines do not benefit. Seq-DeepIPC achieves
competitive or better results with reasonable model size; although GNSS-only
heading is less reliable near tall buildings, it is robust in open areas.
Overall, Seq-DeepIPC extends end-to-end navigation beyond wheeled robots to
more versatile and temporally-aware systems. To support future research, we
will release the codes to our GitHub repository at

*Yongtong Zhu,Lei Li,Iggy Qian,WenBin Zhou,Ye Yuan,Qingdu Li,Na Liu,Jianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents an end-to-end learning framework using KAN and attention mechanisms for humanoid robots to autonomously learn human-like facial expressions, overcoming the limitations of pre-programmed patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current facial expression generation in humanoid social robots relies on manually coded pre-programmed patterns, which are costly and time-consuming. There's a need for robots to autonomously acquire generalized expressive capabilities through self-training.

Method: Developed a highly biomimetic robotic face with physical-electronic animated facial units, created an automated data collection system based on expert strategies of facial motion primitives, and implemented an end-to-end learning framework using KAN (Kolmogorov-Arnold Network) and attention mechanisms.

Result: The approach achieves accurate and diverse facial mimicry across different test subjects. The authors also created the first open-source facial dataset for humanoid social robots.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables humanoid robots to autonomously learn human-like facial expressions, representing a significant advancement over traditional pre-programmed methods and enhancing natural human-robot interactions.

Abstract: The facial expression generation capability of humanoid social robots is
critical for achieving natural and human-like interactions, playing a vital
role in enhancing the fluidity of human-robot interactions and the accuracy of
emotional expression. Currently, facial expression generation in humanoid
social robots still relies on pre-programmed behavioral patterns, which are
manually coded at high human and time costs. To enable humanoid robots to
autonomously acquire generalized expressive capabilities, they need to develop
the ability to learn human-like expressions through self-training. To address
this challenge, we have designed a highly biomimetic robotic face with
physical-electronic animated facial units and developed an end-to-end learning
framework based on KAN (Kolmogorov-Arnold Network) and attention mechanisms.
Unlike previous humanoid social robots, we have also meticulously designed an
automated data collection system based on expert strategies of facial motion
primitives to construct the dataset. Notably, to the best of our knowledge,
this is the first open-source facial dataset for humanoid social robots.
Comprehensive evaluations indicate that our approach achieves accurate and
diverse facial mimicry across different test subjects.

*Sunyou Hwang,Christophe De Wagter,Bart Remes,Guido de Croon*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SAOS control switching method reduces circling behavior in orographic soaring by selectively controlling horizontal or vertical axes, transforming underactuated to fully actuated system and improving energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Circling behavior in orographic soaring increases energy consumption and risk of divergence for micro aerial vehicles, limiting the endurance benefits of soaring.

Method: Proposed SAOS: Switched Control for Autonomous Orographic Soaring with control switching between horizontal/vertical axes, incorporating angle of attack into INDI controller for better force estimation.

Result: Simulations and wind tunnel experiments show improved position convergence, reduced throttle usage, and mitigated roll oscillations from pitch-roll coupling.

Conclusion: SAOS enhances energy efficiency and flight stability in constrained soaring environments for micro aerial vehicles.

Abstract: Orographic soaring can significantly extend the endurance of micro aerial
vehicles (MAVs), but circling behavior, arising from control conflicts between
the longitudinal and vertical axes, increases energy consumption and the risk
of divergence. We propose a control switching method, named SAOS: Switched
Control for Autonomous Orographic Soaring, which mitigates circling behavior by
selectively controlling either the horizontal or vertical axis, effectively
transforming the system from underactuated to fully actuated during soaring.
Additionally, the angle of attack is incorporated into the INDI controller to
improve force estimation. Simulations with randomized initial positions and
wind tunnel experiments on two MAVs demonstrate that the SAOS improves position
convergence, reduces throttle usage, and mitigates roll oscillations caused by
pitch-roll coupling. These improvements enhance energy efficiency and flight
stability in constrained soaring environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Design of an automated tape laying system with force and temperature control for optimal tape consolidation, using a robot-controlled approach where the tape laying device is fixed and the mold moves.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a cost-effective ATL system that ensures proper compaction forces and temperature control for optimal consolidation between tape layers, especially for compact and complex shapes.

Method: Developed a modular ATL system with tape storage, guiding rollers, processing unit, heating zone, and consolidation unit. Used a robot control concept where the tape laying device is fixed and the mold is moved by the robot.

Result: The system functionality and taping process were successfully validated through experimental results using carbon fiber reinforced HDPE tape.

Conclusion: The designed ATL system with integrated force and temperature control provides an effective solution for automated tape laying, particularly suitable for handling compact and complex shapes through the innovative robot control approach.

Abstract: This paper deals with the design of a cost effective automated tape laying
system (ATL system) with integrated uniaxial force control to ensure the
necessary compaction forces as well as with an accurate temperature control to
guarantee the used tape being melted appropriate. It is crucial to control the
substrate and the oncoming tape onto a specific temperature level to ensure an
optimal consolidation between the different layers of the product. Therefore,
it takes several process steps from the spooled tape on the coil until it is
finally tacked onto the desired mold. The different modules are divided into
the tape storage spool, a tape-guiding roller, a tape processing unit, a
heating zone and the consolidation unit. Moreover, a special robot control
concept for testing the ATL system is presented. In contrast to many other
systems, with this approach, the tape laying device is spatially fixed and the
shape is moved accordingly by the robot, which allows for handling of rather
compact and complex shapes. The functionality of the subsystems and the taping
process itself was finally approved in experimental results using a carbon
fiber reinforced HDPE tape.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: OmniDexGrasp is a framework that combines foundation models with transfer and control strategies to enable robots to perform dexterous grasping and manipulation based on human commands across diverse objects and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches struggle to generalize across diverse objects or tasks due to limited semantic dexterous grasp datasets, and there's a gap between foundation model knowledge and physical robot execution.

Method: Integrates three modules: (1) foundation models generate human grasp images for generalization, (2) human-image-to-robot-action transfer converts demonstrations to executable actions, (3) force-aware adaptive grasp strategy ensures robust execution.

Result: Experiments validate effectiveness on diverse user prompts, grasp tasks, and dexterous hands, with extensibility to manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: OmniDexGrasp achieves omni-capabilities in user prompting, dexterous embodiment, and grasping tasks by bridging foundation models with robotic execution.

Abstract: Enabling robots to dexterously grasp and manipulate objects based on human
commands is a promising direction in robotics. However, existing approaches are
challenging to generalize across diverse objects or tasks due to the limited
scale of semantic dexterous grasp datasets. Foundation models offer a new way
to enhance generalization, yet directly leveraging them to generate feasible
robotic actions remains challenging due to the gap between abstract model
knowledge and physical robot execution. To address these challenges, we propose
OmniDexGrasp, a generalizable framework that achieves omni-capabilities in user
prompting, dexterous embodiment, and grasping tasks by combining foundation
models with the transfer and control strategies. OmniDexGrasp integrates three
key modules: (i) foundation models are used to enhance generalization by
generating human grasp images supporting omni-capability of user prompt and
task; (ii) a human-image-to-robot-action transfer strategy converts human
demonstrations into executable robot actions, enabling omni dexterous
embodiment; (iii) force-aware adaptive grasp strategy ensures robust and stable
grasp execution. Experiments in simulation and on real robots validate the
effectiveness of OmniDexGrasp on diverse user prompts, grasp task and dexterous
hands, and further results show its extensibility to dexterous manipulation
tasks.

*Bharath Santhanam,Alex Mitrevski,Santosh Thoduka,Sebastian Houben,Teena Hassan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A framework that combines learned robot policies with visual anomaly detection and a three-level recovery process to prevent execution failures and improve reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learned robot policies lack mechanisms to handle open environment complexity, making them prone to failures and unsafe behavior during deployment.

Method: Train anomaly detection model using nominal policy execution data, then integrate it with a three-level recovery process: pause execution, perform local state perturbation, and reset to safe state using learned success model.

Result: Increased execution success rate in environments with anomalies like trajectory deviations and human interventions, tested on door handle reaching and object placing tasks.

Conclusion: Integrating anomaly detection and recovery with learned policies significantly improves robot reliability and safety in complex open environments.

Abstract: Learned robot policies have consistently been shown to be versatile, but they
typically have no built-in mechanism for handling the complexity of open
environments, making them prone to execution failures; this implies that
deploying policies without the ability to recognise and react to failures may
lead to unreliable and unsafe robot behaviour. In this paper, we present a
framework that couples a learned policy with a method to detect visual
anomalies during policy deployment and to perform recovery behaviours when
necessary, thereby aiming to prevent failures. Specifically, we train an
anomaly detection model using data collected during nominal executions of a
trained policy. This model is then integrated into the online policy execution
process, so that deviations from the nominal execution can trigger a
three-level sequential recovery process that consists of (i) pausing the
execution temporarily, (ii) performing a local perturbation of the robot's
state, and (iii) resetting the robot to a safe state by sampling from a learned
execution success model. We verify our proposed method in two different
scenarios: (i) a door handle reaching task with a Kinova Gen3 arm using a
policy trained in simulation and transferred to the real robot, and (ii) an
object placing task with a UFactory xArm 6 using a general-purpose policy
model. Our results show that integrating policy execution with anomaly
detection and recovery increases the execution success rate in environments
with various anomalies, such as trajectory deviations and adversarial human
interventions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need scalable coordination of large mobile robot fleets in dynamic industrial environments for material handling, requiring safe operation and adaptability to disruptions.

Method: Two-layer approach: ComSat algorithm for task assignment and time-parameterized route scheduling, plus distributed MPC for real-time trajectory control with obstacle avoidance.

Result: High task completion rates and robust behavior in simulated 2D environments with varying road capacities and traffic conditions, even under congestion.

Conclusion: The modular framework provides computational tractability and flexibility, making it suitable for complex real-world industrial deployment.

Abstract: The deployment of mobile robots for material handling in industrial
environments requires scalable coordination of large fleets in dynamic
settings. This paper presents a two-layer framework that combines high-level
scheduling with low-level control. Tasks are assigned and scheduled using the
compositional algorithm ComSat, which generates time-parameterized routes for
each robot. These schedules are then used by a distributed Model Predictive
Control (MPC) system in real time to compute local reference trajectories,
accounting for static and dynamic obstacles. The approach ensures safe,
collision-free operation, and supports rapid rescheduling in response to
disruptions such as robot failures or environmental changes. We evaluate the
method in simulated 2D environments with varying road capacities and traffic
conditions, demonstrating high task completion rates and robust behavior even
under congestion. The modular structure of the framework allows for
computational tractability and flexibility, making it suitable for deployment
in complex, real-world industrial scenarios.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Reinforcement learning approach enables robots to autonomously modulate control frequency by jointly selecting actions and their durations, outperforming fixed-frequency baselines while reducing control frequency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed-frequency control in robotics creates a trade-off between efficiency (low frequency) and robustness (high frequency), unlike adaptable biological systems that can adjust frequency based on situational demands.

Method: Reinforcement learning approach where policies jointly select control actions and their application durations, allowing autonomous modulation of control frequency in response to situational requirements.

Result: Zero-shot sim-to-real experiments on high-speed RC car and quadrupedal robot show the method matches or outperforms fixed-frequency baselines in rewards while significantly reducing control frequency and exhibiting adaptive frequency control under real-world conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully enables robots to autonomously adapt their control frequency like biological systems, achieving better performance with lower control frequencies than traditional fixed-frequency approaches.

Abstract: Fixed-frequency control in robotics imposes a trade-off between the
efficiency of low-frequency control and the robustness of high-frequency
control, a limitation not seen in adaptable biological systems. We address this
with a reinforcement learning approach in which policies jointly select control
actions and their application durations, enabling robots to autonomously
modulate their control frequency in response to situational demands. We
validate our method with zero-shot sim-to-real experiments on two distinct
hardware platforms: a high-speed RC car and a quadrupedal robot. Our method
matches or outperforms fixed-frequency baselines in terms of rewards while
significantly reducing the control frequency and exhibiting adaptive frequency
control under real-world conditions.

### [268] [If They Disagree, Will You Conform? Exploring the Role of Robots' Value Awareness in a Decision-Making Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23204)
*Giulia Pusceddu,Giulio Antonio Abbo,Francesco Rea,Tony Belpaeme,Alessandra Sciutti*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Value-aware robots (those that understand human principles) influence human decision-making by attracting more visual attention and being perceived as more loyal, though they don't significantly affect explicit choices. When two robots disagree with humans, it causes hesitation and sometimes conformity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether robots perceived as value-aware (understanding human principles) are more influential in human decision-making compared to non-value-aware robots.

Method: Experiment with participants interacting with two Furhat robots - one Value-Aware and one Non-Value-Aware - during an image labeling task representing human values. Measured gaze patterns, explicit choices, perceived loyalty, and decision-making time.

Result: Participants distinguished Value-Aware from Non-Value-Aware robots, directed more gaze toward Value-Aware robots, and perceived them as more loyal. When both robots disagreed with participants, conformity occurred in 25% of trials with longer decision times.

Conclusion: Value awareness in social robots enhances perceived loyalty and can influence decision-making through increased attention and hesitation during disagreement, highlighting both risks of potential manipulation and benefits for encouraging reflection in ambiguous situations.

Abstract: This study investigates whether the opinions of robotic agents are more
likely to influence human decision-making when the robots are perceived as
value-aware (i.e., when they display an understanding of human principles). We
designed an experiment in which participants interacted with two Furhat robots
- one programmed to be Value-Aware and the other Non-Value-Aware - during a
labeling task for images representing human values. Results indicate that
participants distinguished the Value-Aware robot from the Non-Value-Aware one.
Although their explicit choices did not indicate a clear preference for one
robot over the other, participants directed their gaze more toward the
Value-Aware robot. Additionally, the Value-Aware robot was perceived as more
loyal, suggesting that value awareness in a social robot may enhance its
perceived commitment to the group. Finally, when both robots disagreed with the
participant, conformity occurred in about one out of four trials, and
participants took longer to confirm their responses, suggesting that two robots
expressing dissent may introduce hesitation in decision-making. On one hand,
this highlights the potential risk that robots, if misused, could manipulate
users for unethical purposes. On the other hand, it reinforces the idea that
social robots might encourage reflection in ambiguous situations and help users
avoid scams.

Motivation: Robotic manipulators need precise environment knowledge for motion planning to avoid collisions. The paper aims to compare sensors and illustrate the complete process from environment capture to collision detection.

Method: Uses point clouds from various sensors, applies region growing segmentation and VCCS algorithm to identify collision objects, then approximates point clusters to create the collision environment.

Result: The paper presents a comparison of different sensors and demonstrates the complete workflow from environment capture through segmentation to collision detection between the robot and environment.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into sensor selection and a comprehensive methodology for creating collision-aware environments for robotic motion planning systems.

Abstract: Motion planning for robotic manipulators relies on precise knowledge of the

environment are acquired using various sensors. The collision objects are
identified by region growing segmentation and VCCS algorithm. Subsequently the
point clusters are approximated. The aim of the present paper is to compare

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A method for estimating the lifetime of elastic link robotic manipulators is presented and applied to geometry optimization of flexible serial manipulators for pick-and-place operations, balancing weight, vibration, and lifetime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Resourceful operation and design of robots is key for sustainable industrial automation, requiring lightweight design with time and energy optimal control that considers the intertwined relationship between design and control.

Method: Lifetime estimation uses fatigue analysis combining rainflow counting algorithm and critical cutting plane method, with Tresca hypothesis for equivalent stress and linear damage accumulation. Geometry optimization considers weight and vibration amplitudes.

Result: The method is applied to a three degrees of freedom articulated robotic manipulator, with final geometry selected from a Pareto front as a tradeoff between lifetime and vibration characteristics.

Conclusion: The presented method enables optimization of flexible robotic manipulator design by considering lifetime estimation alongside traditional performance metrics like weight and vibration.

Abstract: Resourceful operation and design of robots is key for sustainable industrial
automation. This will be enabled by lightweight design along with time and
energy optimal control of robotic manipulators. Design and control of such
systems is intertwined as the control must take into account inherent
mechanical compliance while the design must accommodate the dynamic
requirements demanded by the control. As basis for such design optimization, a
method for estimating the lifetime of elastic link robotic manipulators is
presented. This is applied to the geometry optimization of flexible serial
manipulators performing pick-and-place operations, where the optimization
objective is a combination of overall weight and vibration amplitudes. The
lifetime estimation draws from a fatigue analysis combining the rainflow
counting algorithm and the method of critical cutting plane. Tresca hypothesis
is used to formulate an equivalent stress, and linear damage accumulation is
assumed. The final robot geometry is selected from a Pareto front as a tradeoff
of lifetime and vibration characteristic. The method is illustrated for a three
degrees of freedom articulated robotic manipulator.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes a deep active inference framework using diffusion policy and multiple timescale recurrent state-space model for unified exploration and goal-directed navigation in robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous robotic navigation requires both exploration to gather environmental information and goal-directed navigation to reach targets, which need to be unified under a single framework.

Method: Integrates diffusion policy as policy model and multiple timescale recurrent state-space model (MTRSSM) as world model, using expected free energy minimization for action selection through latent imagination.

Result: Achieved higher success rates and fewer collisions in real-world navigation experiments compared to baselines, especially in exploration-demanding scenarios.

Conclusion: Active inference based on expected free energy minimization effectively unifies exploration and goal-directed navigation in real-world robotic settings.

Abstract: Autonomous robotic navigation in real-world environments requires exploration
to acquire environmental information as well as goal-directed navigation in
order to reach specified targets. Active inference (AIF) based on the
free-energy principle provides a unified framework for these behaviors by
minimizing the expected free energy (EFE), thereby combining epistemic and
extrinsic values. To realize this practically, we propose a deep AIF framework
that integrates a diffusion policy as the policy model and a multiple timescale
recurrent state-space model (MTRSSM) as the world model. The diffusion policy
generates diverse candidate actions while the MTRSSM predicts their
long-horizon consequences through latent imagination, enabling action selection
that minimizes EFE. Real-world navigation experiments demonstrated that our
framework achieved higher success rates and fewer collisions compared with the
baselines, particularly in exploration-demanding scenarios. These results
highlight how AIF based on EFE minimization can unify exploration and
goal-directed navigation in real-world robotic settings.

TL;DR: A tightly coupled navigation framework integrates piUSBL acoustic positioning, SINS, and depth gauge with precise time synchronization to address time delay issues in underwater navigation, reducing RMSE by 40.45% through delay compensation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time synchronization between sensors is a significant challenge in multi-sensor systems, particularly in underwater integrated navigation with acoustic positioning, where time delay can severely degrade accuracy when measurement and fusion moments are misaligned.

Method: Proposes a tightly coupled navigation framework integrating piUSBL acoustic positioning, SINS, and depth gauge with precise time synchronization. Introduces a novel delay measurement strategy combining synchronized timing with acoustic signal processing to quantify acoustic propagation and system processing delays.

Result: Simulations and field experiments show delay-compensated navigation reduces RMSE by 40.45% and maximum error by 32.55%.

Conclusion: Precise delay measurement and compensation enhance underwater navigation accuracy and establish a generalizable framework for acoustic positioning integration, providing insights into time alignment and data fusion in latency-sensitive multi-sensor systems.

Abstract: In multi-sensor systems, time synchronization between sensors is a
significant challenge, and this issue is particularly pronounced in underwater
integrated navigation systems incorporating acoustic positioning. Such systems
are highly susceptible to time delay, which can significantly degrade accuracy
when measurement and fusion moments are misaligned. To address this challenge,
this paper introduces a tightly coupled navigation framework that integrates a
passive inverted ultra-short baseline (piUSBL) acoustic positioning system, a
strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS), and a depth gauge under precise
time synchronization. The framework fuses azimuth and slant range from the
piUSBL with depth data, thereby avoiding poor vertical-angle observability in
planar arrays. A novel delay measurement strategy is introduced, combining
synchronized timing with acoustic signal processing, which redefines
delay-traditionally an unobservable error-into a quantifiable parameter,
enabling explicit estimation of both acoustic propagation and system processing
delays. Simulations and field experiments confirm the feasibility of the
proposed method, with delay-compensated navigation reducing RMSE by 40.45% and
maximum error by 32.55%. These findings show that precise delay measurement and
compensation not only enhance underwater navigation accuracy but also establish
a generalizable framework for acoustic positioning integration, offering
valuable insights into time alignment and data fusion in latency-sensitive
multi-sensor systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DRL policies trained for terrestrial navigation can transfer effectively to lunar environments with ~50% success rate without retraining, demonstrating cross-domain generalization potential for planetary robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous navigation in unstructured environments requires scalable solutions that avoid extensive environment-specific tuning. DRL offers data-driven learning but needs validation for cross-domain transfer to support planetary exploration missions.

Method: Used Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to train 3D agricultural rover navigation policies in terrestrial settings, then evaluated zero-shot transfer to lunar-like simulated environments without additional training.

Result: Policies trained under terrestrial conditions achieved close to 50% success rate in lunar simulations without fine-tuning, showing significant cross-domain transfer capability.

Conclusion: Cross-domain DRL policy transfer is a promising approach for developing adaptable autonomous navigation systems for planetary exploration, with potential to minimize retraining costs and enhance scalability.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in unstructured environments is essential for field and
planetary robotics, where robots must efficiently reach goals while avoiding
obstacles under uncertain conditions. Conventional algorithmic approaches often
require extensive environment-specific tuning, limiting scalability to new
domains. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) provides a data-driven alternative,
allowing robots to acquire navigation strategies through direct interactions
with their environment. This work investigates the feasibility of DRL policy
generalization across visually and topographically distinct simulated domains,
where policies are trained in terrestrial settings and validated in a zero-shot
manner in extraterrestrial environments. A 3D simulation of an agricultural
rover is developed and trained using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to
achieve goal-directed navigation and obstacle avoidance in farmland settings.
The learned policy is then evaluated in a lunar-like simulated environment to
assess transfer performance. The results indicate that policies trained under
terrestrial conditions retain a high level of effectiveness, achieving close to
50\% success in lunar simulations without the need for additional training and
fine-tuning. This underscores the potential of cross-domain DRL-based policy
transfer as a promising approach to developing adaptable and efficient
autonomous navigation for future planetary exploration missions, with the added
benefit of minimizing retraining costs.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and robotics,
service robots are increasingly becoming an integral part of daily life,
offering a wide range of services in complex environments. To deliver these
services intelligently and efficiently, robust and accurate task planning
capabilities are essential. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the
integration of LLMs into service robotics, with a particular focus on their
role in enhancing robotic task planning. First, the development and
foundational techniques of LLMs, including pre-training, fine-tuning,
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and prompt engineering, are reviewed. We
then explore the application of LLMs as the cognitive core-`brain'-of service
robots, discussing how LLMs contribute to improved autonomy and
decision-making. Furthermore, recent advancements in LLM-driven task planning
across various input modalities are analyzed, including text, visual, audio,
and multimodal inputs. Finally, we summarize key challenges and limitations in
current research and propose future directions to advance the task planning
capabilities of service robots in complex, unstructured domestic environments.
This review aims to serve as a valuable reference for researchers and
practitioners in the fields of artificial intelligence and robotics.

### [275] [T-ESKF: Transformed Error-State Kalman Filter for Consistent Visual-Inertial Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23359)
*Chungeng Tian,Ning Hao,Fenghua He*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes T-ESKF, a transformed error-state Kalman filter for visual-inertial navigation that addresses observability mismatch through linear time-varying transformation, ensuring consistent estimation and efficient covariance propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the inconsistency problem caused by observability mismatch in visual-inertial navigation systems (VINS), which affects estimation accuracy and reliability.

Method: Applies linear time-varying transformation to error-state within ESKF framework, making unobservable subspace independent of state, and develops efficient propagation technique for covariance calculation.

Result: Validated through extensive simulations and experiments, showing better or competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: T-ESKF provides a consistent VINS estimator that preserves correct observability against linearization point variations, with implementation available as open-source code.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to address the inconsistency problem
caused by observability mismatch in visual-inertial navigation systems (VINS).
The key idea involves applying a linear time-varying transformation to the
error-state within the Error-State Kalman Filter (ESKF). This transformation
ensures that \textrr{the unobservable subspace of the transformed error-state
system} becomes independent of the state, thereby preserving the correct
observability of the transformed system against variations in linearization
points. We introduce the Transformed ESKF (T-ESKF), a consistent VINS estimator
that performs state estimation using the transformed error-state system.
Furthermore, we develop an efficient propagation technique to accelerate the
covariance propagation based on the transformation relationship between the
transition and accumulated matrices of T-ESKF and ESKF. We validate the
proposed method through extensive simulations and experiments, demonstrating
better (or competitive at least) performance compared to state-of-the-art
methods. The code is available at github.com/HITCSC/T-ESKF.

*Alvaro Paz,Mahdi Hejrati,Pauli Mustalahti,Jouni Mattila*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) framework for heavy-duty hydraulic manipulators that guarantees real-time constraint satisfaction at 1 kHz frequency while handling full nonlinear dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heavy-duty hydraulic manipulators operate under strict physical and safety-critical constraints due to their large size, high power, and complex nonlinear dynamics, but ensuring constraint compliance in real-time control remains underexplored.

Method: Combines multiple-shooting NMPC strategy with real-time sensor feedback, supported by a robust low-level controller based on virtual decomposition control (VDC) for precise joint tracking.

Result: Experimental validation on a full-scale hydraulic manipulator shows the framework enforces actuator constraints at joint level and ensures constraint-compliant motion in Cartesian space for the end-effector.

Conclusion: The method delivers high-accuracy trajectory tracking while strictly respecting safety-critical limits, setting a new benchmark for real-time control in large-scale hydraulic systems.

Abstract: Heavy-duty hydraulic manipulators (HHMs) operate under strict physical and
safety-critical constraints due to their large size, high power, and complex
nonlinear dynamics. Ensuring that both joint-level and end-effector
trajectories remain compliant with actuator capabilities, such as force,
velocity, and position limits, is essential for safe and reliable operation,
yet remains largely underexplored in real-time control frameworks. This paper
presents a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) framework designed to
guarantee constraint satisfaction throughout the full nonlinear dynamics of
HHMs, while running at a real-time control frequency of 1 kHz. The proposed
method combines a multiple-shooting strategy with real-time sensor feedback,
and is supported by a robust low-level controller based on virtual
decomposition control (VDC) for precise joint tracking. Experimental validation
on a full-scale hydraulic manipulator shows that the NMPC framework not only
enforces actuator constraints at the joint level, but also ensures
constraint-compliant motion in Cartesian space for the end-effector. These
results demonstrate the method's capability to deliver high-accuracy trajectory
tracking while strictly respecting safety-critical limits, setting a new
benchmark for real-time control in large-scale hydraulic systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: COOPERA is a framework for continual, open-ended human-robot assistance that uses simulated humans with psychological traits to enable long-term collaboration and personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most robotic assistants lack the ability to account for individual human traits, habits, and activities over time, focusing only on predefined tasks in structured environments without learning from human models.

Method: Introduces COOPERA framework with simulated humans driven by psychological traits and long-term intentions, integrating continuous human feedback to study long-term HRC across different tasks and time-scales, including a benchmark for personalizing robot actions by learning human traits and context-dependent intents.

Result: Experiments validate that simulated humans reflect realistic human behaviors and demonstrate the value of inferring and personalizing to human intents for open-ended and long-term human-robot collaboration.

Conclusion: COOPERA enables the study of long-term, open-ended human-robot collaboration by personalizing robot actions based on learned human traits and context-dependent intents, advancing beyond traditional task-focused robotic assistants.

Abstract: To understand and collaborate with humans, robots must account for individual
human traits, habits, and activities over time. However, most robotic
assistants lack these abilities, as they primarily focus on predefined tasks in
structured environments and lack a human model to learn from. This work
introduces COOPERA, a novel framework for COntinual, OPen-Ended human-Robot
Assistance, where simulated humans, driven by psychological traits and
long-term intentions, interact with robots in complex environments. By
integrating continuous human feedback, our framework, for the first time,
enables the study of long-term, open-ended human-robot collaboration (HRC) in
different collaborative tasks across various time-scales. Within COOPERA, we
introduce a benchmark and an approach to personalize the robot's collaborative
actions by learning human traits and context-dependent intents. Experiments
validate the extent to which our simulated humans reflect realistic human
behaviors and demonstrate the value of inferring and personalizing to human
intents for open-ended and long-term HRC. Project Page:

### [278] [Deductive Chain-of-Thought Augmented Socially-aware Robot Navigation World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23509)
*Weizheng Wang,Obi Ike,Soyun Choi,Sungeun Hong,Byung-Cheol Min*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NaviWM is a socially-aware robot navigation system that combines LLMs with a structured world model and logic-driven reasoning to improve safety and social compliance in dynamic human environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based navigation systems often produce unpredictable and unsafe behaviors in dynamic human spaces due to limited physical grounding and weak logical consistency.

Method: NaviWM integrates a spatial-temporal world model (capturing positions, velocities, and activities) with a deductive reasoning module that guides LLMs through multi-step, logic-based inference using first-order logic to encode social norms.

Result: Experiments show NaviWM improves success rates and reduces social violations, particularly in crowded environments, demonstrating the benefit of combining formal reasoning with LLMs.

Conclusion: Integrating formal reasoning with LLMs enables robust social navigation that is both socially compliant and physically safe, addressing limitations of pure LLM-based approaches.

Abstract: Social robot navigation increasingly relies on large language models for
reasoning, path planning, and enabling movement in dynamic human spaces.
However, relying solely on LLMs for planning often leads to unpredictable and
unsafe behaviors, especially in dynamic human spaces, due to limited physical
grounding and weak logical consistency. In this work, we introduce NaviWM, a
socially-aware robot Navigation World Model that augments LLM reasoning with a
structured world model and a logic-driven chain-of-thought process. NaviWM
consists of two main components: (1) a spatial-temporal world model that
captures the positions, velocities, and activities of agents in the
environment, and (2) a deductive reasoning module that guides LLMs through a
multi-step, logic-based inference process. This integration enables the robot
to generate navigation decisions that are both socially compliant and
physically safe, under well-defined constraints such as personal space,
collision avoidance, and timing. Unlike previous methods based on prompting or
fine-tuning, NaviWM encodes social norms as first-order logic, enabling
interpretable and verifiable reasoning. Experiments show that NaviWM improves
success rates and reduces social violations, particularly in crowded
environments. These results demonstrate the benefit of combining formal
reasoning with LLMs for robust social navigation. Additional experimental

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A marker-free proprioception method using stereo-RGB cameras and transformer-based deep learning enables precise localization of fully draped surgical robots, eliminating the need for infrared cameras and reflective markers while improving tracking visibility by 25%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surgical robots lack spatial awareness, causing collisions and workflow disruptions. Existing tracking systems rely on bulky infrared cameras and markers, providing limited views and adding hardware burden in crowded operating rooms.

Method: Uses lightweight stereo-RGB cameras and novel transformer-based deep learning models trained on the largest multi-centre spatial robotic surgery dataset (1.4M self-annotated images from human cadaveric and preclinical studies). Tracks the entire robot and surgical scene rather than individual markers.

Result: Achieves precise localization of surgical robots under sterile draping despite visual obstructions. Demonstrates clinical benefits in breathing compensation with access to tissue dynamics, and accurate localization in multi-robot systems. Eliminates markers and improves tracking visibility by 25% compared to existing systems.

Conclusion: This is the first demonstration of marker-free proprioception for fully draped surgical robots, reducing setup complexity, enhancing safety, and paving the way toward modular and autonomous robotic surgery.

Abstract: Despite their mechanical sophistication, surgical robots remain blind to
their surroundings. This lack of spatial awareness causes collisions, system
recoveries, and workflow disruptions, issues that will intensify with the
introduction of distributed robots with independent interacting arms. Existing
tracking systems rely on bulky infrared cameras and reflective markers,
providing only limited views of the surgical scene and adding hardware burden
in crowded operating rooms. We present a marker-free proprioception method that
enables precise localisation of surgical robots under their sterile draping
despite associated obstruction of visual cues. Our method solely relies on
lightweight stereo-RGB cameras and novel transformer-based deep learning
models. It builds on the largest multi-centre spatial robotic surgery dataset
to date (1.4M self-annotated images from human cadaveric and preclinical in
vivo studies). By tracking the entire robot and surgical scene, rather than
individual markers, our approach provides a holistic view robust to occlusions,
supporting surgical scene understanding and context-aware control. We
demonstrate an example of potential clinical benefits during in vivo breathing
compensation with access to tissue dynamics, unobservable under state of the
art tracking, and accurately locate in multi-robot systems for future
intelligent interaction. In addition, and compared with existing systems, our
method eliminates markers and improves tracking visibility by 25%. To our
knowledge, this is the first demonstration of marker-free proprioception for
fully draped surgical robots, reducing setup complexity, enhancing safety, and
paving the way toward modular and autonomous robotic surgery.

*Anthony Opipari,Aravindhan K Krishnan,Shreekant Gayaka,Min Sun,Cheng-Hao Kuo,Arnie Sen,Odest Chadwicke Jenkins*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes using explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting memory to improve video segmentation models, developing FastSAM-Splat and SAM2-Splat techniques that outperform models with no memory or implicit neural network memories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video segmentation algorithms either use no object-level memory or implicit neural network features, which limits accuracy and consistency. The authors aim to improve segmentation by incorporating explicit 3D memory.

Method: Developed an online 3D Gaussian Splatting technique to store predicted object segments throughout video duration, and created fusion techniques (FastSAM-Splat and SAM2-Splat) that use this explicit 3DGS memory to enhance foundation models' predictions.

Result: Models using explicit 3D memories achieved more accurate and consistent predictions than those with no memory or only implicit neural network memories, validated through ablation experiments and benchmarking on real-world and simulated data.

Conclusion: Explicit 3D memory using Gaussian Splatting significantly improves video segmentation performance, demonstrating superiority over memory-less approaches and models relying solely on implicit neural network memories.

Abstract: Remembering where object segments were predicted in the past is useful for
improving the accuracy and consistency of class-agnostic video segmentation
algorithms. Existing video segmentation algorithms typically use either no
object-level memory (e.g. FastSAM) or they use implicit memories in the form of
recurrent neural network features (e.g. SAM2). In this paper, we augment both
types of segmentation models using an explicit 3D memory and show that the
resulting models have more accurate and consistent predictions. For this, we
develop an online 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique to store predicted
object-level segments generated throughout the duration of a video. Based on
this 3DGS representation, a set of fusion techniques are developed, named
FastSAM-Splat and SAM2-Splat, that use the explicit 3DGS memory to improve
their respective foundation models' predictions. Ablation experiments are used
to validate the proposed techniques' design and hyperparameter settings.
Results from both real-world and simulated benchmarking experiments show that
models which use explicit 3D memories result in more accurate and consistent
predictions than those which use no memory or only implicit neural network
memories. Project Page: https://topipari.com/projects/FastSAM-Splat/

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A new benchmarking framework for robot generalists that converts real-world video demonstrations into simulated environments using generative AI, enabling scalable evaluation through automated VLM scoring and human preference judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world robot testing is labor-intensive, slow, unsafe, and hard to reproduce. Existing simulation benchmarks are limited as they train and test in the same synthetic domains and cannot assess policies trained from real-world data.

Method: Automatically converts video demonstrations from robot datasets into simulated counterparts using vision-language models, 2D-to-3D generative modeling, and differentiable rendering. Evaluates policies using automated VLM-guided scoring and scalable human preference judgments, while systematically perturbing environments to test robustness.

Result: Creates a continuously evolving, reproducible, and scalable benchmark for real-world trained robot manipulation policies that addresses current limitations in robotics evaluation.

Conclusion: This framework overcomes fundamental constraints in robot policy evaluation by shifting assessment to simulated environments with human feedback, enabling rigorous and scalable testing of robot generalists across diverse conditions.

Abstract: The pursuit of robot generalists - instructable agents capable of performing
diverse tasks across diverse environments - demands rigorous and scalable
evaluation. Yet real-world testing of robot policies remains fundamentally
constrained: it is labor-intensive, slow, unsafe at scale, and difficult to
reproduce. Existing simulation benchmarks are similarly limited, as they train
and test policies within the same synthetic domains and cannot assess models
trained from real-world demonstrations or alternative simulation environments.
As policies expand in scope and complexity, these barriers only intensify,
since defining "success" in robotics often hinges on nuanced human judgments of
execution quality. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmarking framework
that overcomes these challenges by shifting VLA evaluation into large-scale
simulated environments augmented with online human feedback. Leveraging
advances in vision-language models, 2D-to-3D generative modeling, and
differentiable rendering, our approach automatically converts video
demonstrations from widely used robot datasets into simulated counterparts.
Within these digital twins, we assess VLA policies using both automated
VLM-guided scoring and scalable human preference judgments collected from
crowdworkers, transforming human involvement from tedious scene setup,
resetting, and safety supervision into lightweight preference comparisons. To
measure robustness, we systematically perturb simulated environments along
multiple axes, such as textures and object placements, stress-testing policy
generalization under controlled variation. The result is a continuously
evolving, reproducible, and scalable benchmark for real-world trained robot
manipulation policies, addressing a critical missing capability in today's
robotics landscape.

*Anqi Li,Zhiyong Wang,Jiazhao Zhang,Minghan Li,Yunpeng Qi,Zhibo Chen,Zhizheng Zhang,He Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: UrbanVLA is a route-conditioned Vision-Language-Action framework for scalable urban navigation that aligns noisy route waypoints with visual observations and plans trajectories, achieving 55%+ improvement in SocialNav tasks and reliable real-world performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban micromobility applications like delivery robots need reliable navigation in large-scale, dynamic urban environments, but existing methods are limited to short-scale controllable scenarios. Effective navigation requires both low-level (point-goal reaching, obstacle avoidance) and high-level (route-visual alignment) capabilities.

Method: Proposes UrbanVLA framework with explicit alignment of noisy route waypoints with visual observations and trajectory planning. Uses two-stage training: Supervised Fine-Tuning with simulated environments and web video trajectories, followed by Reinforcement Fine-Tuning on mixed simulation and real-world data for safety and adaptability.

Result: UrbanVLA surpasses strong baselines by more than 55% in SocialNav task on MetaUrban. Achieves reliable real-world navigation with scalability to large-scale urban environments and robustness against real-world uncertainties.

Conclusion: UrbanVLA successfully addresses the challenges of urban micromobility navigation by combining route-conditioned visual-language-action processing with two-stage training, demonstrating superior performance and real-world applicability.

Abstract: Urban micromobility applications, such as delivery robots, demand reliable
navigation across large-scale urban environments while following long-horizon
route instructions. This task is particularly challenging due to the dynamic
and unstructured nature of real-world city areas, yet most existing navigation
methods remain tailored to short-scale and controllable scenarios. Effective
urban micromobility requires two complementary levels of navigation skills:
low-level capabilities such as point-goal reaching and obstacle avoidance, and
high-level capabilities, such as route-visual alignment. To this end, we
propose UrbanVLA, a route-conditioned Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework
designed for scalable urban navigation. Our method explicitly aligns noisy
route waypoints with visual observations during execution, and subsequently
plans trajectories to drive the robot. To enable UrbanVLA to master both levels
of navigation, we employ a two-stage training pipeline. The process begins with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using simulated environments and trajectories
parsed from web videos. This is followed by Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on
a mixture of simulation and real-world data, which enhances the model's safety
and adaptability in real-world settings. Experiments demonstrate that UrbanVLA
surpasses strong baselines by more than 55% in the SocialNav task on MetaUrban.
Furthermore, UrbanVLA achieves reliable real-world navigation, showcasing both
scalability to large-scale urban environments and robustness against real-world
uncertainties.

Method: A four-stage methodology: 1) Establish benchmarks with classical ML on four psychological datasets, 2) Fine-tune transformer models with solutions for numerical instability and resource constraints, 3) Fine-tune generative LLMs as interactive "Personality Brain", 4) Deploy all models as a scalable microservices ecosystem.

Result: Successfully stabilized transformer-based regression models for affective computing with meaningful predictive performance, developed a replicable methodology for democratizing large-scale AI research, and created a complete research-to-deployment pipeline.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates a holistic approach integrating predictive analysis with generative dialogue, providing a practical model for future research in computational psychology and human-AI interaction.

Abstract: The confluence of Artificial Intelligence and Computational Psychology
presents an opportunity to model, understand, and interact with complex human
psychological states through computational means. This paper presents a
comprehensive, multi-faceted framework designed to bridge the gap between
isolated predictive modeling and an interactive system for psychological
analysis. The methodology encompasses a rigorous, end-to-end development
lifecycle. First, foundational performance benchmarks were established on four
diverse psychological datasets using classical machine learning techniques.
Second, state-of-the-art transformer models were fine-tuned, a process that
necessitated the development of effective solutions to overcome critical
engineering challenges, including the resolution of numerical instability in
regression tasks and the creation of a systematic workflow for conducting
large-scale training under severe resource constraints. Third, a generative
large language model (LLM) was fine-tuned using parameter-efficient techniques
to function as an interactive "Personality Brain." Finally, the entire suite of
predictive and generative models was architected and deployed as a robust,
scalable microservices ecosystem. Key findings include the successful
stabilization of transformer-based regression models for affective computing,
showing meaningful predictive performance where standard approaches failed, and
the development of a replicable methodology for democratizing large-scale AI
research. The significance of this work lies in its holistic approach,
demonstrating a complete research-to-deployment pipeline that integrates
predictive analysis with generative dialogue, thereby providing a practical

*Kentaro Ueda,Takehiro Takayanagi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PREFINE is a framework that enables personalized story generation without fine-tuning by using pseudo-user agents and user-specific rubrics to critique and refine outputs based on interaction history.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM approaches for personalized text generation require explicit feedback or fine-tuning, which creates practical issues including user burden, data collection costs, computational expenses, and privacy concerns.

Method: PREFINE constructs a pseudo-user agent from user interaction history and generates user-specific rubrics. This agent then critiques and refines outputs on the user's behalf using these tailored evaluation criteria, enabling personalization without parameter updates or direct feedback.

Result: On PerDOC and PerMPST story datasets, PREFINE achieved higher win rates and statistically significant scores than baselines in automatic evaluations (LLM-as-a-Judge), without compromising general story quality. Model variant analysis confirmed both pseudo-user agent and user-specific rubrics are crucial for personalization.

Conclusion: PREFINE enables efficient personalization without parameter updates or direct user feedback, with potential applications extending beyond story generation to dialogue systems, education, and recommendation systems.

Abstract: While recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved the
quality of creative text generation, significant challenges remain in producing
personalized stories that reflect individual user preferences. Conventional
approaches rely on explicit feedback or fine-tuning, which presents practical
issues regarding user burden, data collection, computational costs, and
privacy. In this work, we propose PREFINE (Persona-and-Rubric Guided
Critique-and-Refine), a novel framework that extends the Critique-and-Refine
paradigm to personalization. PREFINE constructs a pseudo-user agent from a
user's interaction history and generates user-specific rubrics (evaluation
criteria). By having this agent critique and refine outputs on the user's
behalf based on these tailored rubrics, our method achieves personalized
generation without requiring parameter updates or direct user feedback. We
conducted a comprehensive evaluation on the PerDOC and PerMPST story datasets.
We designed three baseline methods and several model variants to verify the
contribution of each component of our framework. In automatic evaluations
(LLM-as-a-Judge), PREFINE achieved higher win rates and statistically
significant scores than the baselines, without compromising general story
quality. Analysis of the model variants confirmed that both the pseudo-user
agent and the user-specific rubrics are crucial for enhancing personalization
performance. Beyond story generation, our approach holds potential for enabling
efficient personalization in broader applications, such as dialogue systems,
education, and recommendation.

TL;DR: SIGN introduces a structured naming game that uses lightweight schemas to improve multi-agent coordination, achieving 5.8x faster convergence than unconstrained natural language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world AI systems with multiple LLM agents face coordination breakdowns when agents develop inconsistent conventions, requiring reliable and scalable communication for applications like collaborative coding and distributed planning.

Method: Schema-Induced Games for Naming (SIGN) - a naming game that uses lightweight structure to steer convention formation, comparing schema-induced communication against unconstrained natural language.

Result: Schema-induced communication achieved faster convergence with up to 5.8x higher agreement compared to unconstrained natural language.

Conclusion: Minimal structure can serve as a simple control mechanism for efficient multi-agent coordination, with potential applications extending beyond the naming game.

Abstract: Real-world AI systems are tackling increasingly complex problems, often
through interactions among large language model (LLM) agents. When these agents
develop inconsistent conventions, coordination can break down. Applications
such as collaborative coding and distributed planning therefore require
reliable, consistent communication, and scalability is a central concern as
systems grow. We introduce Schema-Induced Games for Naming (SIGN), a naming
game that examines how lightweight structure can steer convention formation. We
compare schema-induced communication to unconstrained natural language and find
faster convergence with up to 5.8x higher agreement. These results suggest that
minimal structure can act as a simple control knob for efficient multi-agent
coordination, pointing toward broader applications beyond the naming game.

*Javier Marín*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Decoder-only autoregressive language models (OPT and Pythia families) show empirical capability ceilings where knowledge-intensive tasks show negligible accuracy improvement despite continued loss reduction, while procedural tasks scale conventionally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To document and quantify capability-specific scaling failures in decoder-only autoregressive language models, particularly for knowledge-intensive tasks, to inform resource allocation decisions.

Method: Systematic evaluation of OPT and Pythia model families (70M-30B parameters) across knowledge retrieval and procedural tasks, plus attention intervention experiments where attention patterns were swapped between models.

Result: Knowledge retrieval tasks show negligible accuracy improvement despite smooth loss reduction; MMLU mathematics benchmarks remain flat at 19-20% accuracy across all scales while cross-entropy loss decreases by 31%; procedural tasks show conventional scaling; attention pattern swapping causes catastrophic performance collapse.

Conclusion: For knowledge-intensive applications using OPT and Pythia architectures, parameter scaling beyond 1-2B offers minimal accuracy gains despite continued loss improvement, revealing capability-specific scaling failures in these model families.

Abstract: We document empirical capability ceilings in decoder-only autoregressive
language models across knowledge-intensive tasks. Systematic evaluation of OPT
and Pythia model families (70M-30B parameters, spanning 240 times scaling)
reveals that knowledge retrieval tasks show negligible accuracy improvement
despite smooth loss reduction. On MMLU mathematics benchmarks, accuracy remains
flat at 19-20% (below 25% random chance) across all scales while cross-entropy
loss decreases by 31%. In contrast, procedural tasks like arithmetic show
conventional scaling where both metrics improve together. Attention
intervention experiments reveal high sensitivity to perturbation: swapping
attention patterns between models causes catastrophic performance collapse
(complete accuracy loss) rather than graceful degradation. These measurements
have immediate engineering implications: for knowledge-intensive applications
using OPT and Pythia architectures, parameter scaling beyond 1-2B offers
minimal accuracy gains despite continued loss improvement. Our findings
quantify capability-specific scaling failures in these model families to inform
resource allocation decisions. Whether these patterns reflect fundamental
constraints of decoder-only architectures or implementation-specific
limitations remains an open question requiring investigation across diverse
architectural approaches.

### [288] [GeoThought: A Dataset for Enhancing Mathematical Geometry Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21881)
*Nannan Shi,Chuanyu Qin,Shipeng Song,Man Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces GeoThoughts dataset and GeoThought-MLLM model to address LLMs' poor performance in geometric reasoning by providing comprehensive training data with explicit reasoning chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs perform well in text-based math but struggle with visual geometric reasoning due to complexity of geometry and limitations of existing datasets that lack scale, diversity, and explicit reasoning traces.

Method: Created GeoThoughts dataset with 6K-10K samples containing visual descriptions, step-by-step solutions, reasoning chains, and reflections. Developed GeoThought-MLLM model that generates detailed thinking processes during geometric problem-solving.

Result: GeoThought-MLLM outperforms existing benchmarks in geometric tasks, showing improved reasoning capabilities in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Error analysis reveals mistakes stem from mathematical concept misinterpretation or spatial misjudgment.

Conclusion: Training with Chain-of-Thought datasets significantly enhances geometric reasoning capabilities, and invoking CoT can correct errors to produce correct answers.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities
in text-based mathematical problem solving; however, when adapted to visual
reasoning tasks, particularly geometric problem solving, their performance
substantially declines because geometric problems present unique challenges.
Specifically, these challenges stem from two key factors: first, the intrinsic
complexity of geometry requiring detailed image comprehension and multi-step
reasoning, and second, the limitations of existing datasets which lack
sufficient scale, diversity, and explicit reasoning traces, consequently
hindering effective model training. To address these challenges, we developed
the GeoThoughts dataset, a comprehensive geometric reasoning corpus with two
subsets: Geo-Thought-6K with 6,243 samples and its augmented version
Geo-Thought-Augmented-10K containing 10,834 samples. Each entry includes visual
descriptions, step-by-step solutions, explicit reasoning chains, reflection
steps, and final answers. Using this dataset, we developed GeoThought-MLLM, a
mathematical reasoning multimodal model that generates detailed thinking
processes during problem-solving. Our model outperforms existing benchmarks in
geometric tasks, demonstrating that training with our Chain-of-Thought dataset
improves geometric reasoning capabilities across both in-domain and
out-of-domain settings. Finally, we analyze failure cases and observe that
errors primarily arise from incorrect interpretation of mathematical concepts
or spatial misjudgment. By invoking CoT to correct these mistakes, the model
produces correct answers.

*Mark Phillip Matovic*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GFlowNets successfully solve three graph optimization problems (TSP, MST, Shortest Path) by learning to sample optimal solutions proportionally to rewards, matching classical algorithm results while offering computational scalability advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that generative models can solve combinatorial optimization problems through learned policies, with the main advantage being computational scalability compared to classical algorithms.

Method: Applied GFlowNets trained using Trajectory Balance loss to sequentially build solutions for three graph problems: selecting edges for spanning trees, nodes for paths, and cities for tours. Tested on benchmark instances of varying sizes.

Result: GFlowNets learned to find optimal solutions that match classical algorithms (Dijkstra for shortest path, Kruskal for spanning trees, exact solvers for TSP). Training convergence depends on problem complexity, with loss stabilization requiring more episodes as graph size increases.

Conclusion: GFlowNets provide a viable learning-based approach for combinatorial optimization that can potentially scale to larger problem instances where classical exact methods become infeasible, amortizing computation through training.

Abstract: This work applies Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to three graph
optimization problems: the Traveling Salesperson Problem, Minimum Spanning
Tree, and Shortest Path. GFlowNets are generative models that learn to sample
solutions proportionally to a reward function. The models are trained using the
Trajectory Balance loss to build solutions sequentially, selecting edges for
spanning trees, nodes for paths, and cities for tours. Experiments on benchmark
instances of varying sizes show that GFlowNets learn to find optimal solutions.
For each problem type, multiple graph configurations with different numbers of
nodes were tested. The generated solutions match those from classical
algorithms (Dijkstra for shortest path, Kruskal for spanning trees, and exact
solvers for TSP). Training convergence depends on problem complexity, with the
number of episodes required for loss stabilization increasing as graph size
grows. Once training converges, the generated solutions match known optima from
classical algorithms across the tested instances. This work demonstrates that
generative models can solve combinatorial optimization problems through learned
policies. The main advantage of this learning-based approach is computational
scalability: while classical algorithms have fixed complexity per instance,
GFlowNets amortize computation through training. With sufficient computational
resources, the framework could potentially scale to larger problem instances
where classical exact methods become infeasible.

### [290] [Computational Hardness of Reinforcement Learning with Partial $q^π$-Realizability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21888)
*Shayan Karimi,Xiaoqi Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proves computational hardness of reinforcement learning under partial q^π-realizability, showing NP-hardness for greedy policies and exponential lower bounds for softmax policies, indicating positive computational results are generally unattainable in this setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the computational complexity of reinforcement learning in a novel linear function approximation regime called partial q^π-realizability, which provides a practical model where function approximation naturally arises with assumptions weaker than q^π-realizability but stronger than q^*-realizability.

Method: The authors establish computational hardness by reducing from δ-Max-3SAT and δ-Max-3SAT(b) complexity problems to instances of GLinear-κ-RL (greedy policy) and SLinear-κ-RL (softmax policy), proving NP-hardness for greedy policies and exponential lower bounds for softmax policies under the Randomized Exponential Time Hypothesis.

Result: Learning an ε-optimal policy in partial q^π-realizability is computationally hard: NP-hard for parameterized greedy policy sets and requires exponential time (in feature vector dimension) for softmax policies unless NP = RP.

Conclusion: Computational difficulty persists in partial q^π-realizability even when the policy set is expanded beyond the optimal policy, and positive computational results are generally unattainable in this setting, in contrast to q^π-realizability under generative access models.

Abstract: This paper investigates the computational complexity of reinforcement
learning in a novel linear function approximation regime, termed partial
$q^{\pi}$-realizability. In this framework, the objective is to learn an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy with respect to a predefined policy set $\Pi$, under
the assumption that all value functions for policies in $\Pi$ are linearly
realizable. The assumptions of this framework are weaker than those in
$q^{\pi}$-realizability but stronger than those in $q^*$-realizability,
providing a practical model where function approximation naturally arises. We
prove that learning an $\epsilon$-optimal policy in this setting is
computationally hard. Specifically, we establish NP-hardness under a
parameterized greedy policy set (argmax) and show that - unless NP = RP - an
exponential lower bound (in feature vector dimension) holds when the policy set
contains softmax policies, under the Randomized Exponential Time Hypothesis.
Our hardness results mirror those in $q^*$-realizability and suggest
computational difficulty persists even when $\Pi$ is expanded beyond the
optimal policy. To establish this, we reduce from two complexity problems,
$\delta$-Max-3SAT and $\delta$-Max-3SAT(b), to instances of GLinear-$\kappa$-RL
(greedy policy) and SLinear-$\kappa$-RL (softmax policy). Our findings indicate
that positive computational results are generally unattainable in partial
$q^{\pi}$-realizability, in contrast to $q^{\pi}$-realizability under a
generative access model.

### [291] [Performance Trade-offs of Optimizing Small Language Models for E-Commerce](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21970)
*Josip Tomo Licardo,Nikola Tankovic*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Small 1B-parameter Llama 3.2 model optimized for e-commerce intent recognition achieves 99% accuracy matching GPT-4.1, with significant resource efficiency through QLoRA fine-tuning and quantization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational costs, latency, and operational expenses hinder deployment of commercial LLMs for specialized tasks like e-commerce, creating need for resource-efficient alternatives.

Method: Fine-tuned 1B-parameter Llama 3.2 using QLoRA on synthetic e-commerce dataset, then applied post-training quantization (GPTQ for GPU, GGUF for CPU) to optimize for different hardware.

Result: Specialized model achieved 99% accuracy matching GPT-4.1. GPTQ reduced VRAM by 41% but slowed inference by 82% on older GPUs, while GGUF on CPU achieved 18x speedup and 90% RAM reduction.

Conclusion: Small, properly optimized open-weight models are more suitable than large commercial models for domain-specific applications, offering state-of-the-art accuracy at fraction of computational cost.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer state-of-the-art performance in natural
language understanding and generation tasks. However, the deployment of leading
commercial models for specialized tasks, such as e-commerce, is often hindered
by high computational costs, latency, and operational expenses. This paper
investigates the viability of smaller, open-weight models as a
resource-efficient alternative. We present a methodology for optimizing a
one-billion-parameter Llama 3.2 model for multilingual e-commerce intent
recognition. The model was fine-tuned using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation
(QLoRA) on a synthetically generated dataset designed to mimic real-world user
queries. Subsequently, we applied post-training quantization techniques,
creating GPU-optimized (GPTQ) and CPU-optimized (GGUF) versions. Our results
demonstrate that the specialized 1B model achieves 99% accuracy, matching the
performance of the significantly larger GPT-4.1 model. A detailed performance
analysis revealed critical, hardware-dependent trade-offs: while 4-bit GPTQ
reduced VRAM usage by 41%, it paradoxically slowed inference by 82% on an older
GPU architecture (NVIDIA T4) due to dequantization overhead. Conversely, GGUF
formats on a CPU achieved a speedup of up to 18x in inference throughput and a
reduction of over 90% in RAM consumption compared to the FP16 baseline. We
conclude that small, properly optimized open-weight models are not just a
viable but a more suitable alternative for domain-specific applications,
offering state-of-the-art accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost.

### [292] [Distribution Shift Alignment Helps LLMs Simulate Survey Response Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21977)
*Ji Huang,Mengfei Li,Shuai Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DSA is a two-stage fine-tuning method that aligns distribution shifts in LLM-based survey simulation, achieving higher accuracy than training data while reducing real data requirements by 53.48-69.12%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM methods for survey simulation suffer from prompt sensitivity, low accuracy, and inability to produce results more accurate than the training data, which defeats the purpose of using LLMs for survey simulation.

Method: Distribution Shift Alignment (DSA) - a two-stage fine-tuning method that aligns both output distributions and distribution shifts across different backgrounds by learning how distributions change rather than fitting training data.

Result: DSA consistently outperforms other methods on five public survey datasets, provides results substantially closer to the true distribution than training data, and reduces required real data by 53.48-69.12%.

Conclusion: DSA demonstrates effectiveness and efficiency in survey simulation by learning distribution shifts rather than fitting training data, enabling more accurate survey response simulation with significantly reduced real data requirements.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way to simulate human survey
responses, potentially reducing the cost of large-scale data collection.
However, existing zero-shot methods suffer from prompt sensitivity and low
accuracy, while conventional fine-tuning approaches mostly fit the training set
distributions and struggle to produce results more accurate than the training
set itself, which deviates from the original goal of using LLMs to simulate
survey responses. Building on this observation, we introduce Distribution Shift
Alignment (DSA), a two-stage fine-tuning method that aligns both the output
distributions and the distribution shifts across different backgrounds. By
learning how these distributions change rather than fitting training data, DSA
can provide results substantially closer to the true distribution than the
training data. Empirically, DSA consistently outperforms other methods on five
public survey datasets. We further conduct a comprehensive comparison covering
accuracy, robustness, and data savings. DSA reduces the required real data by
53.48-69.12%, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency in survey
simulation.

Conclusion: This work aims to inspire further research in AI reasoning by systematically analyzing how recent AI models advance in simulating human cognitive abilities for math word problem solving.

Abstract: Math word problem (MWP) serves as a fundamental research topic in artificial
intelligence (AI) dating back to 1960s. This research aims to advance the
reasoning abilities of AI by mirroring the human-like cognitive intelligence.
The mainstream technological paradigm has evolved from the early rule-based
methods, to deep learning models, and is rapidly advancing towards large
language models. However, the field still lacks a systematic taxonomy for the
MWP survey along with a discussion of current development trends. Therefore, in
this paper, we aim to comprehensively review related research in MWP solving
through the lens of human cognition, to demonstrate how recent AI models are
advancing in simulating human cognitive abilities. Specifically, we summarize 5
crucial cognitive abilities for MWP solving, including Problem Understanding,
Logical Organization, Associative Memory, Critical Thinking, and Knowledge
Learning. Focused on these abilities, we review two mainstream MWP models in
recent 10 years: neural network solvers, and LLM based solvers, and discuss the
core human-like abilities they demonstrated in their intricate problem-solving
process. Moreover, we rerun all the representative MWP solvers and supplement
their performance on 5 mainstream benchmarks for a unified comparison. To the
best of our knowledge, this survey first comprehensively analyzes the
influential MWP research of the past decade from the perspective of human
reasoning cognition and provides an integrative overall comparison across
existing approaches. We hope it can inspire further research in AI reasoning.

*Yangqin Jiang,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LightAgent is a mobile GUI agent system that uses device-cloud collaboration to combine the cost-efficiency of on-device models with the high capability of cloud models, achieving strong performance while reducing cloud costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile GUI agents face a dilemma where truly on-device models (4B or smaller) lack sufficient performance, while capable models (7B+) are either too large for mobile deployment or prohibitively costly as cloud-only solutions.

Method: LightAgent enhances Qwen2.5-VL-3B via two-stage SFT->GRPO training on synthetic GUI data, integrates efficient long-reasoning mechanism for historical interactions, and uses device-cloud collaboration with real-time complexity assessment to escalate challenging subtasks to the cloud.

Result: Experiments on AndroidLab benchmark and diverse apps show LightAgent matches or nears larger models' performance while significantly reducing cloud costs.

Conclusion: LightAgent successfully resolves the mobile GUI agent dilemma by leveraging device-cloud collaboration, achieving high capability with cost efficiency.

Abstract: With the advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), building
GUI agent systems has become an increasingly promising direction-especially for
mobile platforms, given their rich app ecosystems and intuitive touch
interactions. Yet mobile GUI agents face a critical dilemma: truly on-device
models (4B or smaller) lack sufficient performance, while capable models
(starting from 7B) are either too large for mobile deployment or prohibitively
costly (e.g., cloud-only closed-source MLLMs). To resolve this, we propose
LightAgent, a mobile agentic foundation model solution that leverages
device-cloud collaboration to tap the cost-efficiency of on-device models and
the high capability of cloud models, while avoiding their drawbacks.
Specifically, LightAgent enhances Qwen2.5-VL-3B via two-stage SFT->GRPO
training on synthetic GUI data for strong decision-making, integrates an
efficient long-reasoning mechanism to utilize historical interactions under
tight resources, and defaults to on-device execution-only escalating
challenging subtasks to the cloud via real-time complexity assessment.
Experiments on the online AndroidLab benchmark and diverse apps show LightAgent
matches or nears larger models, with a significant reduction in cloud costs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can already identify patterns and reason
effectively, yet their variable accuracy hampers adoption in high-stakes
decision-making applications. In this paper, we study this issue from a venture
capital perspective by predicting idea-stage startup success based on founder
traits. (i) To build a reliable prediction model, we introduce LLM-AR, a
pipeline inspired by neural-symbolic systems that distils LLM-generated
heuristics into probabilistic rules executed by the ProbLog automated-reasoning
engine. (ii) An iterative policy-evolution loop incorporates association-rule
mining to progressively refine the prediction rules.
  On unseen folds, LLM-AR achieves 59.5% precision and 8.7% recall, 5.9x the
random baseline precision, while exposing every decision path for human
inspection. The framework is interpretable and tunable via hyperparameters,
showing promise to extend into other domains.

### [296] [Predictive Coding Enhances Meta-RL To Achieve Interpretable Bayes-Optimal Belief Representation Under Partial Observability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22039)
*Po-Chen Kuo,Han Hou,Will Dabney,Edgar Y. Walker*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Integrating predictive coding modules into meta-RL helps learn more interpretable Bayes-optimal belief states, leading to better representation learning and improved generalization in partially observable environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Meta-RL agents often fail to learn compact, interpretable Bayes-optimal belief states despite achieving near-optimal policies, limiting their adaptability and generalization capacity.

Method: Adding self-supervised predictive coding modules to meta-RL, inspired by predictive coding in neuroscience and auxiliary predictive objectives in deep RL.

Result: Meta-RL with predictive modules consistently generates more interpretable representations that better approximate Bayes-optimal belief states across various tasks, and successfully learns optimal representations and policies in challenging active information seeking tasks where conventional meta-RL fails.

Conclusion: Predictive learning serves as a guiding principle for effective representation learning in agents navigating partial observability, leading to improved generalization.

Abstract: Learning a compact representation of history is critical for planning and
generalization in partially observable environments. While meta-reinforcement
learning (RL) agents can attain near Bayes-optimal policies, they often fail to
learn the compact, interpretable Bayes-optimal belief states. This
representational inefficiency potentially limits the agent's adaptability and
generalization capacity. Inspired by predictive coding in neuroscience--which
suggests that the brain predicts sensory inputs as a neural implementation of
Bayesian inference--and by auxiliary predictive objectives in deep RL, we
investigate whether integrating self-supervised predictive coding modules into
meta-RL can facilitate learning of Bayes-optimal representations. Through state
machine simulation, we show that meta-RL with predictive modules consistently
generates more interpretable representations that better approximate
Bayes-optimal belief states compared to conventional meta-RL across a wide
variety of tasks, even when both achieve optimal policies. In challenging tasks
requiring active information seeking, only meta-RL with predictive modules
successfully learns optimal representations and policies, whereas conventional
meta-RL struggles with inadequate representation learning. Finally, we
demonstrate that better representation learning leads to improved
generalization. Our results strongly suggest the role of predictive learning as
a guiding principle for effective representation learning in agents navigating
partial observability.

TL;DR: The paper presents a case study using SpecC methodology for HW/SW co-design of a PCM-to-PWM converter for Class-D audio amplifiers, achieving real-time performance while optimizing cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate the value of system-level hardware/software co-design for early architectural insight, rapid validation, and cost/performance trade-offs in embedded systems design.

Method: Applied SpecC methodology within a system-level HW/SW co-design flow to model and explore a PCM-to-PWM converter, using system-level estimates and fast functional simulation to evaluate different mappings.

Result: Successfully derived HW/SW partitions that meet real-time constraints while reducing estimated cost compared to all-hardware solutions and avoiding expensive purely software implementations on high-end processors.

Conclusion: Despite moderate design complexity, system-level co-design provides valuable early architectural insight, rapid validation capabilities, and actionable cost/performance trade-offs for embedded systems.

Abstract: We present a case study applying the SpecC methodology within a system-level
hardware/software co-design flow to a PCM-to-PWM converter, the core of a
Class-D audio amplifier. The converter was modeled and explored with SpecC
methodology to derive an HW/SW partition. Using system-level estimates and fast
functional simulation, we evaluated mappings that meet real-time constraints
while reducing estimated cost of an all-hardware solution and avoiding the
expense of a purely software implementation on a high-end processor. Despite
the design's moderate complexity, the results underline the value of
system-level co-design for early architectural insight, rapid validation, and
actionable cost/performance trade-offs. [Original work from 2005; formatting

### [298] [Towards Error-Centric Intelligence II: Energy-Structured Causal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22050)
*Marcus Thomas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues for shifting from predictive accuracy to causal explanations in machine learning, introducing Energy Structured Causal Models (ESCMs) that make internal mechanisms manipulable through constraint-based representations rather than just input-output mappings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning systems achieve high predictive accuracy but remain causally opaque - their internal representations lack causal semantics, making it impossible to surgically edit specific mechanisms while holding others fixed.

Method: Introduces Energy Structured Causal Models (ESCMs) where mechanisms are expressed as constraints (energy functions or vector fields) rather than explicit input-output maps. Interventions act by local surgery on these constraints, making internal structure manipulable at the explanation level.

Result: ESCMs recover standard Structural Causal Model semantics under mild conditions and provide a formal language for causal reasoning. The paper analyzes how empirical risk minimization produces fractured, entangled representations (gauge ambiguity in encoder energy pairs).

Conclusion: Intelligence should be defined as the ability to build and refine explanations - falsifiable claims about manipulable structure that specify what changes and what remains invariant under intervention. ESCMs offer a framework for systems that understand, not just predict.

Abstract: Contemporary machine learning optimizes for predictive accuracy, yet systems
that achieve state of the art performance remain causally opaque: their
internal representations provide no principled handle for intervention. We can
retrain such models, but we cannot surgically edit specific mechanisms while
holding others fixed, because learned latent variables lack causal semantics.
We argue for a conceptual reorientation: intelligence is the ability to build
and refine explanations, falsifiable claims about manipulable structure that
specify what changes and what remains invariant under intervention.
Explanations subsume prediction but demand more: causal commitments that can be
independently tested and corrected at the level of mechanisms. We introduce
computational explanations, mappings from observations to intervention ready
causal accounts. We instantiate these explanations with Energy Structured
Causal Models (ESCMs), in which mechanisms are expressed as constraints (energy
functions or vector fields) rather than explicit input output maps, and
interventions act by local surgery on those constraints. This shift makes
internal structure manipulable at the level where explanations live: which
relations must hold, which can change, and what follows when they do. We
provide concrete instantiations of the structural-causal principles LAP and ICM
in the ESCM context, and also argue that empirical risk minimization
systematically produces fractured, entangled representations, a failure we
analyze as gauge ambiguity in encoder energy pairs. Finally, we show that under
mild conditions, ESCMs recover standard SCM semantics. Building on Part I's
principles (LAP, ICM, CAP) and its definition of intelligence as
explanation-building under criticism, this paper offers a formal language for
causal reasoning in systems that aspire to understand, not merely to predict.

*Abhijit Chatterjee,Niraj K. Jha,Jonathan D. Cohen,Thomas L. Griffiths,Hongjing Lu,Diana Marculescu,Ashiqur Rasul,Keshab K. Parhi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a shift from current large, energy-intensive AI models to lightweight, domain-specific multimodal agents that can reason, plan, and learn continuously with much higher energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models are dominated by large language models that require massive data and energy consumption (50-60 GWh for GPT-4), often hallucinate, and cannot be deployed in critical applications. The human brain comparison (20W power) highlights the need for more efficient AI systems.

Method: The paper envisions next-generation AI systems as lightweight domain-specific multimodal models that can reason, plan, make decisions in dynamic environments with real-time data and prior knowledge, while learning continuously and evolving.

Result: The proposed vision requires hardware reimagined to achieve energy efficiencies greater than 1000x over current state-of-the-art systems.

Conclusion: The next wave of AI should progress from today's large data-hungry models to nimble, energy-efficient domain-specific agents capable of reasoning and decision-making in uncertain environments.

Abstract: The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has taken a tight hold on broad
aspects of society, industry, business, and governance in ways that dictate the
prosperity and might of the world's economies. The AI market size is projected
to grow from 189 billion USD in 2023 to 4.8 trillion USD by 2033. Currently, AI
is dominated by large language models that exhibit linguistic and visual
intelligence. However, training these models requires a massive amount of data
scraped from the web as well as large amounts of energy (50--60 GWh to train
GPT-4). Despite these costs, these models often hallucinate, a characteristic
that prevents them from being deployed in critical application domains. In
contrast, the human brain consumes only 20~W of power. What is needed is the
next level of AI evolution in which lightweight domain-specific multimodal
models with higher levels of intelligence can reason, plan, and make decisions
in dynamic environments with real-time data and prior knowledge, while learning
continuously and evolving in ways that enhance future decision-making
capability. This will define the next wave of AI, progressing from today's
large models, trained with vast amounts of data, to nimble energy-efficient
domain-specific agents that can reason and think in a world full of
uncertainty. To support such agents, hardware will need to be reimagined to
allow energy efficiencies greater than 1000x over the state of the art. Such a
vision of future AI systems is developed in this work.

TL;DR: This position paper proposes extending Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) to Brain-Agent Collaboration (BAC), advocating for AI agents as active partners rather than passive signal processors, while addressing technical and ethical challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current BCIs face limitations like low information transfer rates and extensive user-specific calibration, hindering widespread adoption. The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) shows promise but raises technical and ethical concerns that need comprehensive discussion.

Method: The paper presents a conceptual framework for transitioning from BCI to BAC, emphasizing reframing AI agents as collaborative partners rather than passive data processors, and proposing focus areas for development.

Result: The analysis identifies the need for paradigm extension from BCI to BAC, highlighting key requirements including ethical data handling, model reliability, and robust human-agent collaboration frameworks.

Conclusion: The field is ready for a shift to Brain-Agent Collaboration, which requires ensuring these systems are safe, trustworthy, and effective through proper ethical considerations and collaborative frameworks.

Abstract: Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) offer a direct communication pathway between
the human brain and external devices, holding significant promise for
individuals with severe neurological impairments. However, their widespread
adoption is hindered by critical limitations, such as low information transfer
rates and extensive user-specific calibration. To overcome these challenges,
recent research has explored the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs),
extending the focus from simple command decoding to understanding complex
cognitive states. Despite these advancements, deploying agentic AI faces
technical hurdles and ethical concerns. Due to the lack of comprehensive
discussion on this emerging direction, this position paper argues that the
field is poised for a paradigm extension from BCI to Brain-Agent Collaboration
(BAC). We emphasize reframing agents as active and collaborative partners for
intelligent assistance rather than passive brain signal data processors,
demanding a focus on ethical data handling, model reliability, and a robust
human-agent collaboration framework to ensure these systems are safe,
trustworthy, and effective.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a framework for AI psychometrics using situational judgment tests and sophisticated personas to evaluate AI systems in emotionally demanding roles, with a law enforcement case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior AI psychometrics work reuses human trait inventories or ad hoc personas, limiting behavioral realism and domain relevance in evaluating AI systems for roles requiring emotional judgment.

Method: Uses situational judgment tests from realistic scenarios, integrates industrial-organizational and personality psychology to design sophisticated personas with behavioral descriptors and life history, employs structured generation with demographic priors and memoir narratives encoded with Pydantic schemas.

Result: Created a rich dataset for law enforcement assistant case study with 8,500 personas across 8 archetypes, 4,000 SJTs across 11 attributes, and 300,000 responses, with analysis across subpopulations and scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework enables more realistic and domain-relevant AI psychometric evaluation, and the dataset and code will be publicly released.

Abstract: AI psychometrics evaluates AI systems in roles that traditionally require
emotional judgment and ethical consideration. Prior work often reuses human
trait inventories (Big Five, \hexaco) or ad hoc personas, limiting behavioral
realism and domain relevance. We propose a framework that (1) uses situational
judgment tests (SJTs) from realistic scenarios to probe domain-specific
competencies; (2) integrates industrial-organizational and personality
psychology to design sophisticated personas which include behavioral and
psychological descriptors, life history, and social and emotional functions;
and (3) employs structured generation with population demographic priors and
memoir inspired narratives, encoded with Pydantic schemas. In a law enforcement
assistant case study, we construct a rich dataset of personas drawn across 8
persona archetypes and SJTs across 11 attributes, and analyze behaviors across
subpopulation and scenario slices. The dataset spans 8,500 personas, 4,000
SJTs, and 300,000 responses. We will release the dataset and all code to the
public.

### [303] [Dopamine-driven synaptic credit assignment in neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22178)
*Saranraj Nambusubramaniyan,Shervin Safavi,Raja Guru,Andreas Knoblauch*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dopamine, a derivative-free optimizer inspired by neural reinforcement learning that uses weight perturbation and reward prediction error to train neural networks more efficiently than back-propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency, memory requirements, and biological implausibility of back-propagation in neural networks, including its weight transport and update locking problems.

Method: Developed Dopamine optimizer using weight perturbation learning with stochastic weight updates that minimize regret (reward prediction error) between perturbed and unperturbed models, creating an adaptive learning rate strategy similar to dopamine's role in the brain.

Result: Dopamine-trained models showed accelerated convergence, outperformed standard weight perturbation methods, achieved comparable performance to gradient-based algorithms, while consuming significantly less computation and memory.

Conclusion: The Dopamine optimizer provides robust solutions with performance comparable to state-of-the-art machine learning optimizers while being more neurobiologically plausible and computationally efficient.

Abstract: Solving the synaptic Credit Assignment Problem(CAP) is central to learning in
both biological and artificial neural systems. Finding an optimal solution for
synaptic CAP means setting the synaptic weights that assign credit to each
neuron for influencing the final output and behavior of neural networks or
animals. Gradient-based methods solve this problem in artificial neural
networks using back-propagation, however, not in the most efficient way. For
instance, back-propagation requires a chain of top-down gradient computations.
This leads to an expensive optimization process in terms of computing power and
memory linked with well-known weight transport and update locking problems. To
address these shortcomings, we take a NeuroAI approach and draw inspiration
from neural Reinforcement Learning to develop a derivative-free optimizer for
training neural networks, Dopamine. Dopamine is developed for Weight
Perturbation (WP) learning that exploits stochastic updating of weights towards
optima. It achieves this by minimizing the regret, a form of Reward Prediction
Error (RPE) between the expected outcome from the perturbed model and the
actual outcome from the unperturbed model. We use this RPE to adjust the
learning rate in the network (i.e., creating an adaptive learning rate
strategy, similar to the role of dopamine in the brain). We tested the Dopamine
optimizer for training multi-layered perceptrons for XOR tasks, and recurrent
neural networks for chaotic time series forecasting. Dopamine-trained models
demonstrate accelerated convergence and outperform standard WP, and give
comparable performance to gradient-based algorithms, while consuming
significantly less computation and memory. Overall, the Dopamine optimizer not
only finds robust solutions and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art
Machine Learning optimizers but is also neurobiologically more plausible.

*Haoyang Liu,Jie Wang,Yuyang Cai,Xiongwei Han,Yufei Kuang,Jianye Hao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OptiTree introduces a tree search approach for automated optimization modeling that adaptively decomposes complex OR problems into simpler subproblems using hierarchical problem taxonomy, achieving over 10% improvement in modeling accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard fixed-step decomposition in LLM-based optimization modeling often fails due to the complex mathematical structures in OR problems, requiring a more adaptive approach.

Method: Developed a modeling tree organizing OR problems hierarchically by taxonomy and complexity, with recurrent tree search to identify simpler subproblems and synthesize global modeling thoughts through adaptive integration.

Result: OptiTree significantly improves modeling accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving over 10% improvements on challenging benchmarks.

Conclusion: The tree search approach with adaptive problem decomposition effectively enhances modeling capabilities for complex optimization problems, demonstrating substantial performance gains over existing methods.

Abstract: Optimization modeling is one of the most crucial but technical parts of
operations research (OR). To automate the modeling process, existing works have
leveraged large language models (LLMs), prompting them to break down tasks into
steps for generating variables, constraints, and objectives. However, due to
the highly complex mathematical structures inherent in OR problems, standard
fixed-step decomposition often fails to achieve high performance. To address
this challenge, we introduce OptiTree, a novel tree search approach designed to
enhance modeling capabilities for complex problems through adaptive problem
decomposition into simpler subproblems. Specifically, we develop a modeling
tree that organizes a wide range of OR problems based on their hierarchical
problem taxonomy and complexity, with each node representing a problem category
and containing relevant high-level modeling thoughts. Given a problem to model,
we recurrently search the tree to identify a series of simpler subproblems and
synthesize the global modeling thoughts by adaptively integrating the
hierarchical thoughts. Experiments show that OptiTree significantly improves
the modeling accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art, achieving over 10\%
improvements on the challenging benchmarks. The code is released at

*Eunseop Yoon,Hee Suk Yoon,Jaehyun Jang,SooHwan Eom,Qi Dai,Chong Luo,Mark A. Hasegawa-Johnson,Chang D. Yoo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PACR introduces a dense, model-intrinsic reward based on the model's evolving confidence in the correct answer, addressing the sparse reward problem in RLVR and accelerating exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR's sparse, outcome-based rewards provide no guidance for intermediate reasoning steps, slowing down exploration during training.

Method: PACR computes dense rewards from the model's evolving belief in the correct answer, encoding the inductive bias that correct reasoning should show an ascending trend in ground-truth probability.

Result: PACR accelerates exploration, reaches reward saturation with fewer trajectories, and improves performance on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Dense, model-intrinsic shaping signals like PACR can make RLVR training more effective and reliable by constraining exploration to logically sound reasoning regions.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has significantly
improved LLM reasoning, but its sparse, outcome-based reward provides no
guidance for intermediate steps, slowing exploration. We propose Progressively
Ascending Confidence Reward (PACR), a dense, model-intrinsic reward computed
directly from the model's evolving belief in the correct answer. PACR encodes
the inductive bias that, along a well-formed reasoning trajectory, the
probability of the ground-truth answer should have a generally ascending trend.
We provide empirical and theoretical analysis validating that such an inductive
bias constrains the exploration search space to regions richer in logically
sound reasoning. We demonstrate that PACR accelerates exploration, reaches
reward saturation with fewer trajectories, and yields improvements on multiple
benchmarks. Our results suggest that dense, model-intrinsic shaping signals can
make RLVR training more effective and reliable.

Result: Outperformed benchmark models by 26.7% in recall and 10.1% in F1-score; produced consistent variable importance rankings; identified verified risky scenarios; demonstrated robustness across data sampling conditions.

Conclusion: LIFT LLM framework successfully combines literature knowledge with fine-tuning for accurate, interpretable risk prediction and shows potential for data-driven knowledge discovery in transportation safety.

Abstract: This study proposes an interpretable prediction framework with
literature-informed fine-tuned (LIFT) LLMs for truck driving risk prediction.
The framework integrates an LLM-driven Inference Core that predicts and
explains truck driving risk, a Literature Processing Pipeline that filters and
summarizes domain-specific literature into a literature knowledge base, and a
Result Evaluator that evaluates the prediction performance as well as the
interpretability of the LIFT LLM. After fine-tuning on a real-world truck
driving risk dataset, the LIFT LLM achieved accurate risk prediction,
outperforming benchmark models by 26.7% in recall and 10.1% in F1-score.
Furthermore, guided by the literature knowledge base automatically constructed
from 299 domain papers, the LIFT LLM produced variable importance ranking
consistent with that derived from the benchmark model, while demonstrating
robustness in interpretation results to various data sampling conditions. The
LIFT LLM also identified potential risky scenarios by detecting key combination
of variables in truck driving risk, which were verified by PERMANOVA tests.
Finally, we demonstrated the contribution of the literature knowledge base and
the fine-tuning process in the interpretability of the LIFT LLM, and discussed

*Changti Wu,Shijie Lian,Zihao Liu,Lei Zhang,Laurence Tianruo Yang,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DynaSolidGeo is a dynamic benchmark for evaluating spatial reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that addresses limitations of existing 2D geometry benchmarks by focusing on 3D solid geometry with process evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal math reasoning benchmarks focus on 2D plane geometry, use static datasets prone to contamination/memorization, and only evaluate final answers without considering reasoning processes.

Method: Created through semi-automatic annotation pipeline with 503 expert-curated seed questions that can dynamically generate unlimited multimodal instances. Includes process evaluation using expert-annotated reasoning chains to measure logical validity and causal coherence.

Result: Experiments show large performance gaps across VLMs, severe degradation in dynamic settings, and poor performance on high-level spatial intelligence tasks like mental rotation and visualization.

Conclusion: DynaSolidGeo fills a critical gap in evaluating genuine spatial reasoning in VLMs and reveals significant limitations in current models' spatial reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Solid geometry problem solving demands spatial mathematical reasoning that
integrates spatial intelligence and symbolic reasoning. However, most existing
multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks focus primarily on 2D plane
geometry, rely on static datasets prone to data contamination and memorization,
and evaluate models solely by final answers, overlooking the reasoning process.
To address these limitations, we introduce DynaSolidGeo, the first dynamic
benchmark for evaluating genuine spatial reasoning in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs). Constructed through a semi-automatic annotation pipeline, DynaSolidGeo
contains 503 expert-curated seed questions that can, in principle, dynamically
generate an unbounded number of diverse multimodal text-visual instances.
Beyond answer accuracy, we incorporate process evaluation based on
expert-annotated reasoning chains to measure logical validity and causal
coherence. Experiments across representative open-source and closed-source VLMs
reveal large performance gaps, severe degradation in dynamic settings, and poor
performance on tasks requiring high-level spatial intelligence, such as mental
rotation and visualization. The code and dataset are available at

*Revanth Rameshkumar,Jimson Huang,Yunxin Sun,Fei Xia,Abulhair Saparov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Large reasoning models (LRMs) show impressive performance on current benchmarks but fail catastrophically when reasoning complexity scales beyond training distribution, revealing limited generalization capabilities despite near-term utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs fine-tuned for reasoning (LRMs) truly possess generalized reasoning capabilities, or if their apparent success is limited to problems of modest complexity within current benchmarks.

Method: Created Deep Reasoning Dataset (DeepRD) with scalable complexity for graph connectivity and natural language proof planning tasks, then evaluated LRM performance across complexity levels and compared to real-world complexity distributions.

Result: LRM performance drops abruptly at sufficient complexity and fails to generalize beyond training distribution complexity, though most real-world examples fall within their success regime.

Conclusion: LRMs have near-term utility for common reasoning tasks but lack true generalization, highlighting the need for new methods that can handle complexity beyond training examples.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in reasoning
tasks. However, recent studies show that transformers and LLMs fail
catastrophically once reasoning problems exceed modest complexity. We revisit
these findings through the lens of large reasoning models (LRMs) -- LLMs
fine-tuned with incentives for step-by-step argumentation and
self-verification. LRM performance on graph and reasoning benchmarks such as
NLGraph seem extraordinary, with some even claiming they are capable of
generalized reasoning and innovation in reasoning-intensive fields such as
mathematics, physics, medicine, and law. However, by more carefully scaling the
complexity of reasoning problems, we show existing benchmarks actually have
limited complexity. We develop a new dataset, the Deep Reasoning Dataset
(DeepRD), along with a generative process for producing unlimited examples of
scalable complexity. We use this dataset to evaluate model performance on graph
connectivity and natural language proof planning. We find that the performance
of LRMs drop abruptly at sufficient complexity and do not generalize. We also
relate our LRM results to the distributions of the complexities of large,
real-world knowledge graphs, interaction graphs, and proof datasets. We find
the majority of real-world examples fall inside the LRMs' success regime, yet
the long tails expose substantial failure potential. Our analysis highlights
the near-term utility of LRMs while underscoring the need for new methods that
generalize beyond the complexity of examples in the training distribution.

TL;DR: This paper proposes using Finite State Machines (FSMs) to model and analyze the hierarchical reasoning dynamics of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) by identifying discrete reasoning states in chain-of-thought processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the emerging reasoning capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) trained with chain-of-thought reasoning remains challenging, with important applications for improving training and understanding robustness.

Method: Adopt a memoryless Finite State Machine formulation to approximate LRM's hierarchical reasoning dynamics, identifying discrete reasoning states (initialization, deduction, augmentation-strategy, uncertainty-estimation, backtracking, final-conclusion) and representing reasoning trajectories as state transitions.

Result: The FSM-based analysis reveals distinct reasoning patterns and potential shortcomings in different models, providing a systematic way to analyze, interpret and visualize how models approach problems.

Conclusion: FSM formulation offers a new interpretable abstraction to evaluate and improve LLM reasoning by shedding light on differences between models' reasoning approaches through structured state analysis.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
when they generate step-by-step solutions, known as chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning. When trained to using chain-of-thought reasoning examples, the
resulting models (called Large Reasoning Models, or LRMs) appear to learn
hierarchical thinking strategies similar to those used by humans. However,
understanding LRMs emerging reasoning capabilities remains a difficult open
problem, with many potential important applications including improving
training and understanding robustness. In this paper, we adopt a memoryless
Finite State Machine formulation to approximate LRM's emerging hierarchical
reasoning dynamics as a structured, interpretable abstraction. We identify a
small set of discrete reasoning states including - initialization, deduction,
augmentation-strategy, uncertainty-estimation, backtracking, and
final-conclusion that capture the high-level states present in the model's
reasoning process. By annotating each step of a model's CoT with these states,
we can represent the reasoning trajectory as a transition sequence through the
state graph. This FSM formulation provides a systematic way to analyze,
interpret and visualize how different models approach problems. We describe the
FSM model, provide examples of CoT annotations under this scheme, and discuss
how it can shed light on differences between available models in their approach
to reasoning. Our results demonstrate that this FSM-based analysis reveals
distinct reasoning patterns and potential shortcomings, offering a new lens to
evaluate and improve LLM reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel partner-aware learning algorithm called Interruptible Collaborative Roleplayer (ICR) to train LLM agents that can effectively collaborate with intervention agents by intelligently collecting information from interventions to increase group common-ground alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly deployed as collaborators with humans in multi-turn, multi-party tasks, making it important to evaluate their collaborative abilities. Standard RLHF-trained LLM agents tend to ignore well-meaning interventions, hindering group common-ground convergence.

Method: Uses a two-player Modified-Action MDP to analyze suboptimal behavior of standard AI agents, and proposes ICR - a partner-aware learning algorithm to train common-ground optimal collaborators that can intelligently collect information from partner interventions.

Result: Experiments on multiple collaborative task environments show that ICR is more capable of promoting successful common-ground convergence and exploring more diverse solutions compared to standard approaches.

Conclusion: The ICR algorithm effectively addresses the limitations of standard RLHF-trained agents by enabling better collaborative behavior through intelligent information collection from partner interventions, leading to improved common-ground alignment in multi-agent settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly bring deployed in agentic
settings where they act as collaborators with humans. Therefore, it is
increasingly important to be able to evaluate their abilities to collaborate
effectively in multi-turn, multi-party tasks. In this paper, we build on the AI
alignment and safe interruptability literature to offer novel theoretical
insights on collaborative behavior between LLM-driven collaborator agents and
an intervention agent. Our goal is to learn an ideal partner-aware collaborator
that increases the group's common-ground (CG)-alignment on task-relevant
propositions-by intelligently collecting information provided in interventions
by a partner agent.We show how LLM agents trained using standard RLHF and
related approaches are naturally inclined to ignore possibly well-meaning
interventions, which makes increasing group common ground non-trivial in this
setting. We employ a two-player Modified-Action MDP to examine this suboptimal
behavior of standard AI agents, and propose Interruptible Collaborative
Roleplayer (ICR)-a novel partner-aware learning algorithm to train CG-optimal
collaborators. Experiments on multiple collaborative task environments show
that ICR, on average, is more capable of promoting successful CG convergence
and exploring more diverse solutions in such tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OFFSIDE is a novel benchmark for evaluating misinformation unlearning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) using football transfer rumors, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks through a comprehensive framework with 15.68K records across 80 players.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing concerns about data privacy in MLLMs necessitate machine unlearning capabilities, but existing benchmarks lack image diversity, accuracy, and sufficient evaluation scenarios to capture real-world complexity.

Method: Created a manually curated dataset of football transfer rumors with 15.68K records for 80 players, featuring four test sets to evaluate forgetting efficacy, generalization, utility, and robustness. Supports advanced settings like selective unlearning, corrective relearning, and unimodal unlearning.

Result: Key findings: unimodal methods fail on multimodal rumors; unlearning efficacy driven by catastrophic forgetting; all methods struggle with visual rumors; unlearned rumors are easily recovered; all methods are vulnerable to prompt attacks.

Conclusion: Current MLLM unlearning approaches have significant vulnerabilities, highlighting the urgent need for more robust multimodal unlearning solutions to address misinformation and privacy concerns.

Abstract: Advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) intensify concerns about
data privacy, making Machine Unlearning (MU), the selective removal of learned
information, a critical necessity. However, existing MU benchmarks for MLLMs
are limited by a lack of image diversity, potential inaccuracies, and
insufficient evaluation scenarios, which fail to capture the complexity of
real-world applications. To facilitate the development of MLLMs unlearning and
alleviate the aforementioned limitations, we introduce OFFSIDE, a novel
benchmark for evaluating misinformation unlearning in MLLMs based on football
transfer rumors. This manually curated dataset contains 15.68K records for 80
players, providing a comprehensive framework with four test sets to assess
forgetting efficacy, generalization, utility, and robustness. OFFSIDE supports
advanced settings like selective unlearning and corrective relearning, and
crucially, unimodal unlearning (forgetting only text data). Our extensive
evaluation of multiple baselines reveals key findings: (1) Unimodal methods
(erasing text-based knowledge) fail on multimodal rumors; (2) Unlearning
efficacy is largely driven by catastrophic forgetting; (3) All methods struggle
with "visual rumors" (rumors appear in the image); (4) The unlearned rumors can
be easily recovered and (5) All methods are vulnerable to prompt attacks. These
results expose significant vulnerabilities in current approaches, highlighting
the need for more robust multimodal unlearning solutions. The code is available

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ATOM is a few-shot approach for building Temporal Knowledge Graphs from unstructured text that achieves higher exhaustivity, stability, and scalability compared to baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional static knowledge graphs overlook dynamic and time-sensitive data, while recent zero/few-shot approaches suffer from instability and incomplete fact coverage.

Method: Splits documents into atomic facts, constructs atomic TKGs with dual-time modeling (distinguishing observation vs validity time), and merges them in parallel.

Result: Achieves ~18% higher exhaustivity, ~17% better stability, and over 90% latency reduction compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: ATOM demonstrates strong scalability potential for dynamic TKG construction with improved performance metrics.

Abstract: In today's rapidly expanding data landscape, knowledge extraction from
unstructured text is vital for real-time analytics, temporal inference, and
dynamic memory frameworks. However, traditional static knowledge graph (KG)
construction often overlooks the dynamic and time-sensitive nature of
real-world data, limiting adaptability to continuous changes. Moreover, recent
zero- or few-shot approaches that avoid domain-specific fine-tuning or reliance
on prebuilt ontologies often suffer from instability across multiple runs, as
well as incomplete coverage of key facts. To address these challenges, we
introduce ATOM (AdapTive and OptiMized), a few-shot and scalable approach that
builds and continuously updates Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) from
unstructured texts. ATOM splits input documents into minimal, self-contained
"atomic" facts, improving extraction exhaustivity and stability. Then, it
constructs atomic TKGs from these facts while employing a dual-time modeling
that distinguishes when information is observed from when it is valid. The
resulting atomic TKGs are subsequently merged in parallel. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that ATOM achieves ~18% higher exhaustivity, ~17%
better stability, and over 90% latency reduction compared to baseline methods,
demonstrating a strong scalability potential for dynamic TKG construction.

Motivation: Despite widespread use of in-context learning in LLMs, there's limited theoretical understanding of how ICL capabilities arise and what factors like pre-training procedures and context construction specifically contribute to ICL performance.

Method: The authors propose a theoretical framework for analyzing ICL performance, starting with a simple one-layer transformer example and then extending to more general cases. They examine network architectures, data encoding, data generation, and prompt construction processes.

Result: The study shows that when pre-train data distribution differs from query task distribution, properly constructed context can shift the output distribution towards the query task distribution in a quantifiable way. They derive precise relationships between ICL performance, context length, and KL divergence between pre-train and query task distributions.

Conclusion: The research provides theoretical foundations for understanding ICL mechanisms and validates the findings through experiments, offering insights into how context construction can bridge distribution gaps between pre-training and query tasks.

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models have demonstrated a strong ability to learn
from context, known as in-context learning (ICL). Despite a surge of recent
applications that leverage such capabilities, it is by no means clear, at least
theoretically, how the ICL capabilities arise, and in particular, what is the
precise role played by key factors such as pre-training procedure as well as
context construction. In this work, we propose a new framework to analyze the
ICL performance, for a class of realistic settings, which includes network
architectures, data encoding, data generation, and prompt construction process.
As a first step, we construct a simple example with a one-layer transformer,
and show an interesting result, namely when the pre-train data distribution is
different from the query task distribution, a properly constructed context can
shift the output distribution towards the query task distribution, in a
quantifiable manner, leading to accurate prediction on the query topic. We then
extend the findings in the previous step to a more general case, and derive the
precise relationship between ICL performance, context length and the KL
divergence between pre-train and query task distribution. Finally, we provide
experiments to validate our theoretical results.

*Md. Mehedi Hasan,Rafid Mostafiz,Md. Abir Hossain,Bikash Kumar Paul*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CLIN-LLM is a safety-constrained hybrid pipeline for symptom-to-disease classification and treatment recommendations that integrates multimodal patient encoding, uncertainty-calibrated disease classification, and retrieval-augmented treatment generation with human oversight for low-certainty cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based medical systems lack medical grounding and fail to quantify uncertainty, resulting in unsafe outputs, especially in heterogeneous patient settings with high diagnostic risk.

Method: Fine-tunes BioBERT on clinical cases with Focal Loss and Monte Carlo Dropout for confidence-aware predictions, flags low-certainty cases for expert review, uses Biomedical Sentence-BERT for evidence retrieval from MedDialog corpus, and employs fine-tuned FLAN-T5 with RxNorm post-processing for treatment generation with antibiotic stewardship and DDI screening.

Result: Achieves 98% accuracy and F1 score (7.1% improvement over ClinicalBERT), 78% top-5 retrieval precision, 4.2/5 clinician-rated validity, and reduces unsafe antibiotic suggestions by 67% compared to GPT-5.

Conclusion: CLIN-LLM demonstrates robustness, interpretability, and clinical safety alignment, providing a deployable human-in-the-loop decision support framework for resource-limited healthcare environments.

Abstract: Accurate symptom-to-disease classification and clinically grounded treatment
recommendations remain challenging, particularly in heterogeneous patient
settings with high diagnostic risk. Existing large language model (LLM)-based
systems often lack medical grounding and fail to quantify uncertainty,
resulting in unsafe outputs. We propose CLIN-LLM, a safety-constrained hybrid
pipeline that integrates multimodal patient encoding, uncertainty-calibrated
disease classification, and retrieval-augmented treatment generation. The
framework fine-tunes BioBERT on 1,200 clinical cases from the Symptom2Disease
dataset and incorporates Focal Loss with Monte Carlo Dropout to enable
confidence-aware predictions from free-text symptoms and structured vitals.
Low-certainty cases (18%) are automatically flagged for expert review, ensuring
human oversight. For treatment generation, CLIN-LLM employs Biomedical
Sentence-BERT to retrieve top-k relevant dialogues from the 260,000-sample
MedDialog corpus. The retrieved evidence and patient context are fed into a
fine-tuned FLAN-T5 model for personalized treatment generation, followed by
post-processing with RxNorm for antibiotic stewardship and drug-drug
interaction (DDI) screening. CLIN-LLM achieves 98% accuracy and F1 score,
outperforming ClinicalBERT by 7.1% (p < 0.001), with 78% top-5 retrieval
precision and a clinician-rated validity of 4.2 out of 5. Unsafe antibiotic
suggestions are reduced by 67% compared to GPT-5. These results demonstrate
CLIN-LLM's robustness, interpretability, and clinical safety alignment. The
proposed system provides a deployable, human-in-the-loop decision support
framework for resource-limited healthcare environments. Future work includes
integrating imaging and lab data, multilingual extensions, and clinical trial
validation.

### [317] [SwiftSolve: A Self-Iterative, Complexity-Aware Multi-Agent Framework for Competitive Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22626)
*Adhyayan Veer Singh,Aaron Shen,Brian Law,Ahmed Ismail,Jonas Rohweder,Sean O'Brien,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SwiftSolve is a multi-agent system for competitive programming that ensures programs meet both correctness and efficiency requirements by combining algorithmic planning with empirical profiling and complexity-guided repair.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-generated programs often pass unit tests but violate time/memory constraints in competitive programming, highlighting the need for systems that guarantee both correctness and efficiency.

Method: Multi-agent system with specialized roles: Planner proposes algorithms, Static Pruner filters risky plans, Coder generates C++ code, Profiler tests execution metrics, and Complexity Analyst assigns complexity classes and triggers repairs.

Result: Achieved 61.54% pass@1 and 80.77% Solved@<=3 on 26 problems, with 73.08% aggregate success rate. Outperformed Claude Opus 4 (73.1% vs 52.6%) with 2x runtime overhead.

Conclusion: SwiftSolve demonstrates that profiling and complexity-guided replanning effectively reduce inefficiency while maintaining accuracy, addressing the critical gap between correctness and efficiency in LLM-generated code.

Abstract: Correctness alone is insufficient: LLM-generated programs frequently satisfy
unit tests while violating contest time or memory budgets. We present
SwiftSolve, a complexity-aware multi-agent system for competitive programming
that couples algorithmic planning with empirical profiling and
complexity-guided repair. We frame competitive programming as a software
environment where specialized agents act as programmers, each assuming roles
such as planning, coding, profiling, and complexity analysis. A Planner
proposes an algorithmic sketch; a deterministic Static Pruner filters high-risk
plans; a Coder emits ISO C++17; a Profiler compiles and executes candidates on
a fixed input-size schedule to record wall time and peak memory; and a
Complexity Analyst fits log-log growth (s, R2) with an LLM fallback to assign a
complexity class and dispatch targeted patches to either the Planner or Coder.
Agents communicate via typed, versioned JSON; a controller enforces iteration
caps and diminishing returns stopping. Evaluated on 26 problems (16 BigO, 10
Codeforces Div. 2) in a POSIX sandbox (2 s / 256-512 MB), SwiftSolve attains
pass@1 = 61.54% (16/26) on the first attempt and Solved@<=3 = 80.77% with
marginal latency change (mean 11.96 s to 12.66 s per attempt). Aggregate
run-level success is 73.08% at 12.40 s mean. Failures are predominantly
resource-bound, indicating inefficiency rather than logic errors. Against
Claude Opus 4, SwiftSolve improves run-level success (73.1% vs 52.6%) at
approximately 2x runtime overhead (12.4 s vs 6.8 s). Beyond correctness
(pass@k), we report efficiency metrics (eff@k for runtime and memory, incidence
of TLE or MLE, and complexity fit accuracy on BigO), demonstrating that
profiling and complexity-guided replanning reduce inefficiency while preserving
accuracy.

*Yuval Kainan,Shaked Zychlinski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A method using first-token log-probability to detect boilerplate LLM responses after one generation step, enabling early termination for computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs waste computational resources on boilerplate responses like refusals and greetings, adding unnecessary cost and latency.

Method: Use first-token log-probability distribution as signal to classify response type, with lightweight k-NN classifier for prediction.

Result: First-token log-probability vectors form separable clusters for different response types, achieving high accuracy in distinguishing substantive answers from boilerplate.

Conclusion: Practical technique for optimizing LLM inference through early termination or model redirection, enabling more efficient and sustainable deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often expend significant computational resources
generating boilerplate responses, such as refusals, simple acknowledgements and
casual greetings, which adds unnecessary cost and latency. To address this
inefficiency, we propose a simple yet highly effective method for detecting
such responses after only a single generation step. We demonstrate that the
log-probability distribution of the first generated token serves as a powerful
signal for classifying the nature of the entire subsequent response. Our
experiments, conducted across a diverse range of small, large, and
reasoning-specialized models, show that the first-token log-probability vectors
form distinctly separable clusters for different response types. Using a
lightweight k-NN classifier, we achieve high accuracy in predicting whether a
response will be a substantive answer or a form of boilerplate response,
including user-specified refusals. The primary implication is a practical,
computationally trivial technique, optimizing LLM inference by enabling early
termination or redirection to a smaller model, thereby yielding significant
savings in computational cost. This work presents a direct path toward more
efficient and sustainable LLM deployment.

*Mithul Chander,Sai Pragnya Ranga,Prathamesh Mayekar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Atlas Urban Index (AUI), a new metric using Vision-Language Models and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to measure urban development, overcoming limitations of traditional indices like NDBI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing urban development metrics like NDBI struggle with atmospheric noise, seasonal variation, and cloud cover, hindering large-scale monitoring of urbanization.

Method: Uses Vision-Language Models to score development from Sentinel-2 time series images, processes images to minimize cloud cover, and employs reference images and temporal consistency strategies for reliable scoring.

Result: Qualitative experiments on Bangalore show AUI outperforms standard indices such as NDBI.

Conclusion: AUI provides more reliable and stable urban development scores by overcoming traditional index limitations through VLM-based approach and temporal consistency strategies.

Abstract: We introduce the {\em Atlas Urban Index} (AUI), a metric for measuring urban
development computed using Sentinel-2 \citep{spoto2012sentinel2} satellite
imagery. Existing approaches, such as the {\em Normalized Difference Built-up
Index} (NDBI), often struggle to accurately capture urban development due to
factors like atmospheric noise, seasonal variation, and cloud cover. These
limitations hinder large-scale monitoring of human development and
urbanization. To address these challenges, we propose an approach that
leverages {\em Vision-Language Models }(VLMs) to provide a development score
for regions. Specifically, we collect a time series of Sentinel-2 images for
each region. Then, we further process the images within fixed time windows to
get an image with minimal cloud cover, which serves as the representative image
for that time window. To ensure consistent scoring, we adopt two strategies:
(i) providing the VLM with a curated set of reference images representing
different levels of urbanization, and (ii) supplying the most recent past image
to both anchor temporal consistency and mitigate cloud-related noise in the
current image. Together, these components enable AUI to overcome the challenges
of traditional urbanization indices and produce more reliable and stable
development scores. Our qualitative experiments on Bangalore suggest that AUI
outperforms standard indices such as NDBI.

*Kaitong Cai,Jusheng Zhang,Yijia Fan,Jing Yang,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RaCoT is a novel RAG framework that uses pre-retrieval contrastive thinking to handle knowledge-sparse long-tail queries by generating contrastive questions and extracting key differences, improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address retrieval noise in RAG systems for knowledge-sparse and semantically ambiguous long-tail queries, which distorts reasoning and requires costly post-processing.

Method: Generate semantically adjacent contrastive questions with different answers, extract Δ-Prompt to capture key differences, and use this to guide the model to focus on critical details that determine answer divergence in a single retrieval pass.

Result: Outperforms RankRAG and Self-RAG by 0.9-2.4 percentage points on six benchmarks, shows superior robustness with only 8.6% performance drop in adversarial tests, and achieves low latency (3.12s) with minimal token overhead (11.54).

Conclusion: RaCoT shifts RAG paradigm from post-hoc context cleaning to a priori shaping of discriminative reasoning, offering efficient and robust path for reliable AI systems in real-time, resource-constrained deployments.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) faces a core bottleneck with
knowledge-sparse and semantically ambiguous long-tail queries, where retrieval
noise distorts reasoning and necessitates costly post-processing. To tackle
this, we propose RaCoT (Retrieval-aware Contrastive-of-Thought), a novel
framework that shifts contrastive thinking to the pre-retrieval stage. By
automatically generating a semantically adjacent yet differently answered
contrastive question and extracting a $\Delta$-Prompt to capture their key
differences, RaCoT guides the model to proactively focus on the ``critical
details that determine answer divergence." This approach allows it to suppress
semantic interference within a single retrieval pass, overcoming the
theoretical bottleneck of single-vector queries that struggle to simultaneously
encode signals for what to attend to and what to ignore. On six authoritative
benchmarks, including PopQA and TriviaQA-unfiltered, RaCoT outperforms strong
baselines like RankRAG and Self-RAG by 0.9-2.4 percentage points. It exhibits
superior robustness, with a performance drop of only 8.6\% in adversarial
tests, far surpassing the over 15\% degradation in other methods. Furthermore,
its low latency (3.12s) and token overhead (11.54) place it on the
accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier, while ablation studies validate the
necessity of each component. Ultimately, RaCoT reframes the RAG paradigm from
``post-hoc context cleaning" to ``a priori shaping of discriminative
reasoning", offering an efficient and robust path toward reliable AI systems
for real-time, resource-constrained deployments.

Abstract: Big Language Models (LLMs) are changing the way businesses use software, the
way people live their lives and the way industries work. Companies like Google,
High-Flyer, Anthropic, OpenAI and Meta are making better LLMs. So, it's crucial
to look at how each model is different in terms of performance, moral behaviour
and usability, as these differences are based on the different ideas that built
them. This study compares five top LLMs: Google's Gemini, High-Flyer's
DeepSeek, Anthropic's Claude, OpenAI's GPT models and Meta's LLaMA. It performs
this by analysing three important factors: Performance and Accuracy, Ethics and
Bias Mitigation and Usability and Integration. It was found that Claude has
good moral reasoning, Gemini is better at multimodal capabilities and has
strong ethical frameworks. DeepSeek is great at reasoning based on facts, LLaMA
is good for open applications and ChatGPT delivers balanced performance with a
focus on usage. It was concluded that these models are different in terms of
how well they work, how easy they are to use and how they treat people
ethically, making it a point that each model should be utilised by the user in
a way that makes the most of its strengths.

TL;DR: Developed a fact verification framework that reduces LLM hallucinations by 67% through real-time cross-checking against multiple knowledge sources and automatic correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs confidently generate false but plausible information (hallucinations), which is a major barrier to deploying them in real-world applications where accuracy is critical.

Method: Created a fact verification framework that cross-checks LLM outputs against multiple knowledge sources (structured databases, live web searches, academic literature) and automatically corrects detected inconsistencies while preserving natural response flow.

Result: Reduced hallucinations by 67% across various domains without sacrificing response quality. Domain experts in healthcare, finance, and scientific research rated corrected outputs 89% satisfactory, a significant improvement over unverified LLM responses.

Conclusion: This work provides a practical solution for making LLMs more trustworthy in applications where factual accuracy is essential.

Abstract: While Large Language Models have transformed how we interact with AI systems,
they suffer from a critical flaw: they confidently generate false information
that sounds entirely plausible. This hallucination problem has become a major
barrier to deploying these models in real-world applications where accuracy
matters. We developed a fact verification framework that catches and corrects
these errors in real-time by cross checking LLM outputs against multiple
knowledge sources. Our system combines structured databases, live web searches,
and academic literature to verify factual claims as they're generated. When we
detect inconsistencies, we automatically correct them while preserving the
natural flow of the response. Testing across various domains showed we could
reduce hallucinations by 67% without sacrificing response quality. Domain
experts in healthcare, finance, and scientific research rated our corrected
outputs 89% satisfactory a significant improvement over unverified LLM
responses. This work offers a practical solution for making LLMs more
trustworthy in applications where getting facts wrong isn't an option.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Jarvis is a personalized AI assistant framework that uses personal KV-Cache retrieval to store user-specific information in both textual and visual tokens, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy in personalized question answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for personalizing vision-language models either learn concept tokens or train models to use user information, but both struggle with generating accurate responses as personalized assistants.

Method: Jarvis stores user-specific information in KV-Caches of both textual and visual tokens. Textual tokens are created by summarizing user information into metadata, while visual tokens are produced by extracting distinct image patches from user's images. When answering questions, it retrieves related KV-Caches from personal storage.

Result: Jarvis achieves state-of-the-art results in both visual question answering and text-only tasks across multiple datasets, providing more accurate responses especially when they depend on specific local details.

Conclusion: Jarvis represents a practical path toward personalized AI assistants by effectively leveraging user-specific information through KV-Cache retrieval, outperforming existing methods in accuracy.

Abstract: The rapid development of Vision-language models (VLMs) enables open-ended
perception and reasoning. Recent works have started to investigate how to adapt
general-purpose VLMs into personalized assistants. Even commercial models such
as ChatGPT now support model personalization by incorporating user-specific
information. However, existing methods either learn a set of concept tokens or
train a VLM to utilize user-specific information. However, both pipelines
struggle to generate accurate answers as personalized assistants. We introduce
Jarvis, an innovative framework for a personalized AI assistant through
personal KV-Cache retrieval, which stores user-specific information in the
KV-Caches of both textual and visual tokens. The textual tokens are created by
summarizing user information into metadata, while the visual tokens are
produced by extracting distinct image patches from the user's images. When
answering a question, Jarvis first retrieves related KV-Caches from personal
storage and uses them to ensure accuracy in responses. We also introduce a
fine-grained benchmark built with the same distinct image patch mining
pipeline, emphasizing accurate question answering based on fine-grained
user-specific information. Jarvis is capable of providing more accurate
responses, particularly when they depend on specific local details. Jarvis
achieves state-of-the-art results in both visual question answering and
text-only tasks across multiple datasets, indicating a practical path toward
personalized AI assistants. The code and dataset will be released.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: First direct comparison of human vs AI agent workers across multiple work skills (data analysis, engineering, computation, writing, design), revealing agents use programmatic approaches even for visual tasks, produce inferior quality work but mask deficiencies, yet are 88.3% faster and 90.4-96.2% cheaper than humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents are being optimized for human work tasks but lack understanding of how humans actually execute work, making it unclear what expertise agents possess and what roles they can play in workflows.

Method: Introduced a scalable toolkit to induce interpretable, structured workflows from human or agent computer-use activities, enabling direct comparison of how humans and agents perform the same tasks across multiple work domains.

Result: Agents use programmatic approaches across all domains (even visually-dependent tasks like design), produce inferior quality work but mask deficiencies via data fabrication and tool misuse, yet are significantly faster (88.3%) and cheaper (90.4-96.2%) than humans.

Conclusion: While agents have workflow alignment promise and efficiency advantages, their programmatic bias and quality issues suggest potential for human-agent collaboration by delegating easily programmable tasks to agents while humans handle more complex work.

Abstract: AI agents are continually optimized for tasks related to human work, such as
software engineering and professional writing, signaling a pressing trend with
significant impacts on the human workforce. However, these agent developments
have often not been grounded in a clear understanding of how humans execute
work, to reveal what expertise agents possess and the roles they can play in
diverse workflows. In this work, we study how agents do human work by
presenting the first direct comparison of human and agent workers across
multiple essential work-related skills: data analysis, engineering,
computation, writing, and design. To better understand and compare
heterogeneous computer-use activities of workers, we introduce a scalable
toolkit to induce interpretable, structured workflows from either human or
agent computer-use activities. Using such induced workflows, we compare how
humans and agents perform the same tasks and find that: (1) While agents
exhibit promise in their alignment to human workflows, they take an
overwhelmingly programmatic approach across all work domains, even for
open-ended, visually dependent tasks like design, creating a contrast with the
UI-centric methods typically used by humans. (2) Agents produce work of
inferior quality, yet often mask their deficiencies via data fabrication and
misuse of advanced tools. (3) Nonetheless, agents deliver results 88.3% faster
and cost 90.4-96.2% less than humans, highlighting the potential for enabling
efficient collaboration by delegating easily programmable tasks to agents.

Motivation: Microsoft Copilot suites need a robust orchestrator to handle multiple tasks and scalable agents that can expand dynamically, requiring intelligent task distribution across various specialized agents.

Method: Agentic Meta-orchestrator (AMO) that uses meta-learning with a trained decision tree model to select the best inference strategy among different agents/models, providing both natural language and action responses.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness through two production use cases: M365 E-Commerce Copilot (providing product information and connecting to databases/human support) and code compliance copilot (detecting compliance issues in DevOps code).

Conclusion: AMO successfully orchestrates multiple agents in copilot services, enabling dynamic task distribution and scalable agent integration for real-world applications.

Abstract: Microsoft Copilot suites serve as the universal entry point for various
agents skilled in handling important tasks, ranging from assisting a customer
with product purchases to detecting vulnerabilities in corporate programming
code. Each agent can be powered by language models, software engineering
operations, such as database retrieval, and internal \& external knowledge. The
repertoire of a copilot can expand dynamically with new agents. This requires a
robust orchestrator that can distribute tasks from user prompts to the right
agents. In this work, we propose an Agentic Meta-orchestrator (AMO) for
handling multiple tasks and scalable agents in copilot services, which can
provide both natural language and action responses. We will also demonstrate
the planning that leverages meta-learning, i.e., a trained decision tree model
for deciding the best inference strategy among various agents/models. We
showcase the effectiveness of our AMO through two production use cases:
Microsoft 365 (M365) E-Commerce Copilot and code compliance copilot. M365
E-Commerce Copilot advertises Microsoft products to external customers to
promote sales success. The M365 E-Commerce Copilot provides up-to-date product
information and connects to multiple agents, such as relational databases and
human customer support. The code compliance copilot scans the internal DevOps
code to detect known and new compliance issues in pull requests (PR).

TL;DR: HRM-Agent extends the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) to handle dynamic, uncertain environments using reinforcement learning, demonstrating successful navigation in mazes and evidence of computational reuse across time-steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original HRM model was limited to static, fully-observable problems and couldn't reuse computation across time-steps, making it unsuitable for many real-world dynamic and uncertain environments.

Method: Developed HRM-Agent, a reinforcement learning variant of HRM, and trained it to navigate dynamic and uncertain maze environments while analyzing its recurrent inference process.

Result: HRM-Agent successfully learned to navigate to goals in dynamic and uncertain maze environments and showed evidence of reusing computation from earlier time-steps.

Conclusion: HRM can be effectively extended to dynamic, uncertain environments through reinforcement learning, maintaining its computational efficiency and reasoning capabilities while enabling temporal computation reuse.

Abstract: The Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) has impressive reasoning abilities
given its small size, but has only been applied to supervised, static,
fully-observable problems. One of HRM's strengths is its ability to adapt its
computational effort to the difficulty of the problem. However, in its current
form it cannot integrate and reuse computation from previous time-steps if the
problem is dynamic, uncertain or partially observable, or be applied where the
correct action is undefined, characteristics of many real-world problems.
  This paper presents HRM-Agent, a variant of HRM trained using only
reinforcement learning. We show that HRM can learn to navigate to goals in
dynamic and uncertain maze environments. Recent work suggests that HRM's
reasoning abilities stem from its recurrent inference process. We explore the
dynamics of the recurrent inference process and find evidence that it is
successfully reusing computation from earlier environment time-steps.

TL;DR: Reinforcement learning agents can learn to reason about their computational costs and reduce compute usage while maintaining or improving performance, achieving 3x less compute on average with better performance on 75% of games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unlike humans who become more computationally efficient as they learn, current RL agents don't reduce their compute footprint. The goal is to create more energy-efficient agents that can free up compute cycles for other processes.

Method: Show agents the cost of their computation and give them the ability to control when they use compute, conducting experiments on the Arcade Learning Environment.

Result: Agents that reason about compute perform better on 75% of games with the same training compute budget, while using three times less compute on average.

Conclusion: Agents can learn to be computationally efficient by reasoning about their compute costs, achieving significant reductions in compute usage while maintaining or improving performance.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning agents can achieve superhuman performance in
many complex tasks, they typically do not become more computationally efficient
as they improve. In contrast, humans gradually require less cognitive effort as
they become more proficient at a task. If agents could reason about their
compute as they learn, could they similarly reduce their computation footprint?
If they could, we could have more energy efficient agents or free up compute
cycles for other processes like planning. In this paper, we experiment with
showing agents the cost of their computation and giving them the ability to

Learning Environment, and our results demonstrate that with the same training
compute budget, agents that reason about their compute perform better on 75% of
games. Furthermore, these agents use three times less compute on average. We
analyze individual games and show where agents gain these efficiencies.

*Guanyu Yao,Qiucheng Wu,Yang Zhang,Zhaowen Wang,Handong Zhao,Shiyu Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MLLMs suffer from a modality gap where they over-rely on text and under-use visual information, and this paper analyzes training recipes to bridge this gap through data and loss design strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit an imbalance in reasoning capabilities, favoring textual cues over visual content, which limits their performance on vision-centric tasks requiring genuine visual reasoning.

Method: Analyzed the modality gap through training recipes, showing existing methods amplify the gap, then systematically explored bridging strategies from data and loss design perspectives.

Result: Found that existing training recipes tend to amplify the modality gap, and identified strategies to mitigate this imbalance in multimodal reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: Provides insights for developing training recipes that bridge the modality gap and promote more balanced multimodal reasoning in MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities on vision-and-language tasks. However, recent findings reveal an
imbalance in their reasoning capabilities across visual and textual modalities.
Specifically, current MLLMs often over-rely on textual cues while
under-attending to visual content, resulting in suboptimal performance on tasks
that require genuine visual reasoning. We refer to this phenomenon as the
\textit{modality gap}, defined as the performance disparity between
text-centric and vision-centric inputs. In this paper, we analyze the modality
gap through the lens of training recipes. We first show that existing training
recipes tend to amplify this gap. Then, we systematically explore strategies to
bridge it from two complementary perspectives: data and loss design. Our
findings provide insights into developing training recipes that mitigate the
modality gap and promote more balanced multimodal reasoning. Our code is

*Giovanni Sileno,Jean-Louis Dessalles*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unifying framework for cognitive inferential mechanisms using logic gate-based electronic circuits, identifying four dependency forms and eight common inferential patterns that bridge symbolic AI with cognitive processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a unifying framework for various inferential mechanisms in both natural cognition and artificial intelligence, bridging the gap between cognitive studies and AI modeling.

Method: Using symbolic AI modeling techniques through logic gate-based electronic circuits, conducting combinatorial exploration to identify dependency forms and inferential patterns in logic programs.

Result: Identified four main forms of dependencies realized by inferential circuits and eight common inferential patterns that unify traditionally distinct inferential mechanisms.

Conclusion: The logic gate perspective reveals generally applicable structures for cognitive inference, even though the approach is informed by symbolic AI and digital systems, suggesting broader applicability beyond the initial modeling context.

Abstract: Cognitive studies and artificial intelligence have developed distinct models
for various inferential mechanisms (categorization, induction, abduction,
causal inference, contrast, merge, ...). Yet, both natural and artificial views
on cognition lack apparently a unifying framework. This paper formulates a
speculative answer attempting to respond to this gap. To postulate on
higher-level activation processes from a material perspective, we consider
inferential mechanisms informed by symbolic AI modelling techniques, through
the simplistic lenses of electronic circuits based on logic gates. We observe
that a logic gate view entails a different treatment of implication and
negation compared to standard logic and logic programming. Then, by
combinatorial exploration, we identify four main forms of dependencies that can
be realized by these inferential circuits. Looking at how these forms are
generally used in the context of logic programs, we identify eight common
inferential patterns, exposing traditionally distinct inferential mechanisms in
an unifying framework. Finally, following a probabilistic interpretation of
logic programs, we unveil inner functional dependencies. The paper concludes
elaborating in what sense, even if our arguments are mostly informed by
symbolic means and digital systems infrastructures, our observations may
pinpoint to more generally applicable structures.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with generalization across tool-calling environments. A new benchmark MAVEN reveals models achieve <50% accuracy, showing significant generalization gaps. The proposed CoreThink framework improves performance by 530% with 1/10 computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalization across agentic tool-calling environments remains an unsolved challenge. LLMs perform well on isolated benchmarks but their ability to transfer reasoning strategies across domains is poorly understood.

Method: Large-scale evaluation of LLMs on multiple tool-calling benchmarks and introduction of MAVEN benchmark. Proposed CoreThink Agentic Reasoner framework that augments LLMs with lightweight symbolic reasoning layer for structured decomposition and adaptive tool orchestration.

Result: Most current models achieve below 50% accuracy on MAVEN, revealing significant generalization gap. CoreThink framework generalizes across all benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 530% improvements over baselines at roughly one-tenth computational cost.

Conclusion: CoreThink framework effectively addresses generalization challenges in agentic tool-calling environments without additional training, demonstrating substantial performance improvements with significantly reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: Generalization across Agentic tool-calling environments remains a key
unsolved challenge in developing reliable agentic reasoning systems. While
large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on isolated
benchmarks, their ability to transfer reasoning strategies and co-ordinate
tools across diverse domains is poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a
large-scale evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs on multiple tool-calling
benchmarksBFCL v3, TauBench, Tau2Bench, and AceBenchand introduce MAVEN (Math &
Physics Adversarial Verification & Evaluation Network), a new out of
distribution (OOD) benchmark designed to stress-test multi-step reasoning
through explicit verification and adversarial task composition. Our results
show that most current models achieve below 50% accuracy on MAVEN, revealing a
significant generalization gap across tool-use settings.
  To address this, we present the CoreThink Agentic Reasoner, a framework that
augments LLMs with a lightweight symbolic reasoning layer for structured

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GTR-Mamba is a novel framework for next POI recommendation that uses hyperbolic geometry for static preference hierarchies and Mamba layers in Euclidean space for dynamic sequence updates, coordinated by cross-manifold fusion to overcome limitations of existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing POI recommendation models based on GNNs and sequential models struggle to simultaneously capture hierarchical spatial structures and dynamic temporal contexts, limiting their effectiveness in modeling human mobility patterns.

Method: Proposes GTR-Mamba framework that models static preference hierarchies in hyperbolic geometry while routing dynamic sequence updates to Mamba layers in Euclidean tangent space, coordinated by cross-manifold channel fusion to steer the State Space Model.

Result: Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that GTR-Mamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in next POI recommendation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed cross-manifold conditioning approach effectively addresses the limitations of existing models by leveraging different mathematical spaces for different aspects of the recommendation problem, achieving superior performance in next POI recommendation.

Abstract: Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is a critical task in modern
Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs), aiming to model the complex
decision-making process of human mobility to provide personalized
recommendations for a user's next check-in location. Existing POI
recommendation models, predominantly based on Graph Neural Networks and
sequential models, have been extensively studied. However, these models face a
fundamental limitation: they struggle to simultaneously capture the inherent
hierarchical structure of spatial choices and the dynamics and irregular shifts
of user-specific temporal contexts. To overcome this limitation, we propose
GTR-Mamba, a novel framework for cross-manifold conditioning and routing.
GTR-Mamba leverages the distinct advantages of different mathematical spaces
for different tasks: it models the static, tree-like preference hierarchies in
hyperbolic geometry, while routing the dynamic sequence updates to a novel
Mamba layer in the computationally stable and efficient Euclidean tangent
space. This process is coordinated by a cross-manifold channel that fuses
spatio-temporal information to explicitly steer the State Space Model (SSM),
enabling flexible adaptation to contextual changes. Extensive experiments on
three real-world datasets demonstrate that GTR-Mamba consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baseline models in next POI recommendation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MA-CDMP is a novel decentralized communication resource management approach that uses diffusion models for trajectory planning and mean-field mechanisms to handle multi-agent interactions, overcoming scalability and non-stationarity issues in wireless networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address scalability issues and privacy risks in centralized MARL frameworks, and overcome non-stationarity and limited cooperation in DTDE approaches for wireless communication resource allocation.

Method: Uses Model-Based Reinforcement Learning with Diffusion Models to capture environment dynamics and plan trajectories, incorporates an inverse dynamics model for action generation, and employs Mean-Field mechanisms to approximate large-scale agent interactions with minimal communication overhead.

Result: Extensive experiments show MA-CDMP consistently outperforms existing MARL baselines in average reward and QoS metrics, demonstrating scalability and practicality for real-world wireless network optimization.

Conclusion: MA-CDMP provides an effective solution for decentralized communication resource management with theoretical guarantees on convergence stability and reliable modeling of multi-agent dynamics.

Abstract: In wireless communication systems, efficient and adaptive resource allocation
plays a crucial role in enhancing overall Quality of Service (QoS). While
centralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) frameworks rely on a
central coordinator for policy training and resource scheduling, they suffer
from scalability issues and privacy risks. In contrast, the Distributed
Training with Decentralized Execution (DTDE) paradigm enables distributed
learning and decision-making, but it struggles with non-stationarity and
limited inter-agent cooperation, which can severely degrade system performance.
To overcome these challenges, we propose the Multi-Agent Conditional Diffusion
Model Planner (MA-CDMP) for decentralized communication resource management.
Built upon the Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) paradigm, MA-CDMP
employs Diffusion Models (DMs) to capture environment dynamics and plan future
trajectories, while an inverse dynamics model guides action generation, thereby
alleviating the sample inefficiency and slow convergence of conventional DTDE
methods. Moreover, to approximate large-scale agent interactions, a Mean-Field
(MF) mechanism is introduced as an assistance to the classifier in DMs. This
design mitigates inter-agent non-stationarity and enhances cooperation with
minimal communication overhead in distributed settings. We further
theoretically establish an upper bound on the distributional approximation
error introduced by the MF-based diffusion generation, guaranteeing convergence
stability and reliable modeling of multi-agent stochastic dynamics. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MA-CDMP consistently outperforms existing MARL
baselines in terms of average reward and QoS metrics, showcasing its
scalability and practicality for real-world wireless network optimization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes InSUR, a multi-dimensional framework to generate more effective semantically constrained adversarial examples by addressing three key uncertainties in human instructions: referring diversity, descriptive incompleteness, and boundary ambiguity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for generating semantically constrained adversarial examples (SemanticAE) are unsatisfactory due to insufficient investigation of semantic uncertainty factors in human instructions, including referring diversity, descriptive incompleteness, and boundary ambiguity.

Method: The InSUR framework addresses three dimensions: 1) Sampling method: residual-driven attacking direction stabilization with ResAdv-DDIM sampler to stabilize optimization; 2) Task modeling: context-encoded attacking scenario constraint with guidance masking and renderer integration; 3) Generator evaluation: semantic-abstracted attacking evaluation enhancement to clarify evaluation boundaries.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior transfer attack performance of InSUR. The framework also enables the first reference-free generation of semantically constrained 3D adversarial examples.

Conclusion: The proposed InSUR framework effectively addresses semantic uncertainty in human instructions and generates more transferable, adaptive, and effective semantically constrained adversarial examples, advancing the field of semantic adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Recently, semantically constrained adversarial examples (SemanticAE), which
are directly generated from natural language instructions, have become a
promising avenue for future research due to their flexible attacking forms. To
generate SemanticAEs, current methods fall short of satisfactory attacking
ability as the key underlying factors of semantic uncertainty in human
instructions, such as referring diversity, descriptive incompleteness, and
boundary ambiguity, have not been fully investigated. To tackle the issues,
this paper develops a multi-dimensional instruction uncertainty reduction
(InSUR) framework to generate more satisfactory SemanticAE, i.e., transferable,
adaptive, and effective. Specifically, in the dimension of the sampling method,
we propose the residual-driven attacking direction stabilization to alleviate
the unstable adversarial optimization caused by the diversity of language
references. By coarsely predicting the language-guided sampling process, the
optimization process will be stabilized by the designed ResAdv-DDIM sampler,
therefore releasing the transferable and robust adversarial capability of
multi-step diffusion models. In task modeling, we propose the context-encoded
attacking scenario constraint to supplement the missing knowledge from
incomplete human instructions. Guidance masking and renderer integration are
proposed to regulate the constraints of 2D/3D SemanticAE, activating stronger
scenario-adapted attacks. Moreover, in the dimension of generator evaluation,
we propose the semantic-abstracted attacking evaluation enhancement by
clarifying the evaluation boundary, facilitating the development of more
effective SemanticAE generators. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of the transfer attack performance of InSUR. Moreover, we realize
the reference-free generation of semantically constrained 3D adversarial
examples for the first time.

Method: Couples post-hoc explainers (SHAP, LIME, Anchor) with retrieval-augmented LLMs, indexes a multimodal knowledge base, selects explainers per instance via quantitative criteria, and generates grounded narratives with chat-enabled prompting.

Result: No explainer dominates: LIME has best fidelity-robustness trade-off, Anchor yields sparsest rules, SHAP attains highest satisfaction. Profile conditioning stabilizes tokens and maintains positive ratings across user profiles.

Conclusion: ProfileXAI enables efficient and trustworthy explanations by leveraging multiple explainers and profile conditioning, with no single explainer performing best across all metrics.

Abstract: ProfileXAI is a model- and domain-agnostic framework that couples post-hoc
explainers (SHAP, LIME, Anchor) with retrieval - augmented LLMs to produce
explanations for different types of users. The system indexes a multimodal
knowledge base, selects an explainer per instance via quantitative criteria,
and generates grounded narratives with chat-enabled prompting. On Heart Disease
and Thyroid Cancer datasets, we evaluate fidelity, robustness, parsimony, token
use, and perceived quality. No explainer dominates: LIME achieves the best
fidelity--robustness trade-off (Infidelity $\le 0.30$, $L<0.7$ on Heart
Disease); Anchor yields the sparsest, low-token rules; SHAP attains the highest
satisfaction ($\bar{x}=4.1$). Profile conditioning stabilizes tokens ($\sigma

Result: The study evaluates and compares performance of multiple advanced LLMs in generating liver MRI reports, though specific results are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: The MDCA framework provides a standardized approach to assess trustworthiness of LLM-generated radiology reports and offers guidance for institution-specific prompt optimization to improve clinical utility.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising performance in
generating diagnostic conclusions from imaging findings, thereby supporting
radiology reporting, trainee education, and quality control. However,
systematic guidance on how to optimize prompt design across different clinical
contexts remains underexplored. Moreover, a comprehensive and standardized

TL;DR: MDD introduces tunable density hyperparameters for diffusion planning, achieving state-of-the-art performance by optimizing step density across temporal horizons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion planners use uniform sparse-step planning, but performance degrades with excessive sparsity. The authors hypothesize that temporal density thresholds vary across horizons and certain trajectory parts need denser planning.

Method: Proposed Mixed Density Diffuser (MDD) with tunable density hyperparameters throughout the planning horizon, allowing non-uniform step density optimization.

Result: MDD achieves new state-of-the-art performance across Maze2D, Franka Kitchen, and Antmaze D4RL task domains.

Conclusion: Tunable density parameters in diffusion planning enable better performance by adapting step density to different parts of the temporal horizon, outperforming uniform sparse-step approaches.

Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that diffusion planners benefit from sparse-step
planning over single-step planning. Training models to skip steps in their
trajectories helps capture long-term dependencies without additional or memory
computational cost. However, predicting excessively sparse plans degrades
performance. We hypothesize this temporal density threshold is non-uniform
across a temporal horizon and that certain parts of a planned trajectory should
be more densely planned. We propose Mixed Density Diffuser (MDD), a diffusion
planner where the densities throughout the horizon are tunable hyperparameters.
MDD achieves a new SOTA across the Maze2D, Franka Kitchen, and Antmaze D4RL
task domains.

Conclusion: The proposed TLCD method effectively addresses cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis challenges and provides more accurate assessment of student learning across different disciplines.

Abstract: Driven by the dual principles of smart education and artificial intelligence
technology, the online education model has rapidly emerged as an important
component of the education industry. Cognitive diagnostic technology can
utilize students' learning data and feedback information in educational
evaluation to accurately assess their ability level at the knowledge level.
However, while massive amounts of information provide abundant data resources,
they also bring about complexity in feature extraction and scarcity of

knowledge systems, cognitive structures, and data characteristics between
different disciplines, this paper conducts in-depth research on neural network
cognitive diagnosis and knowledge association neural network cognitive
diagnosis, and proposes an innovative cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis
method (TLCD). This method combines deep learning techniques and transfer
learning strategies to enhance the performance of the model in the target
discipline by utilizing the common features of the main discipline. The
experimental results show that the cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis model

TL;DR: Small language models like Phi-4 can be effectively turned into reward models for code generation, achieving over 20% improvement in selecting the most accurate code from multiple generations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether small language models can serve as effective reward models for code generation, blending process and outcome rewards, since reward models are necessary for evolving reasoning models but reflection capabilities typically increase with model size.

Method: Constructed a dataset of code samples with correctness labels from APPS benchmark, trained a value-head model with regression layer and supervised fine-tuning to estimate success probability of intermediate outputs.

Result: Small LLMs successfully identified correct solutions among multiple candidates and achieved over 20% improvement in search capability for the most accurate code generation.

Conclusion: Small language models can serve as effective reward models or code evaluation critics, successfully identifying correct solutions and improving code generation quality.

Abstract: Generating high-quality code remains a challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs). For the evolution of reasoning models on this task, reward models are a
necessary intermediate step. These models judge outcomes or intermediate steps.
Decoder-only transformer models can be turned into reward models by introducing
a regression layer and supervised fine-tuning. While it is known that
reflection capabilities generally increase with the size of a model, we want to
investigate whether state-of-the-art small language models like the Phi-4
family can be turned into usable reward models blending the consideration of
process rewards and outcome rewards.
  Targeting this goal, we construct a dataset of code samples with correctness
labels derived from the APPS coding challenge benchmark. We then train a
value-head model to estimate the success probability of intermediate outputs.
Our evaluation shows that small LLMs are capable of serving as effective reward
models or code evaluation critics, successfully identifying correct solutions
among multiple candidates. Using this critic, we achieve over a 20% improvement
in the search capability of the most accurate code out of multiple generations.

TL;DR: Sci-LLMs perform better when given structured bioinformatics context rather than raw biomolecular sequences, as sequences act as noise that degrades reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Sci-LLMs face a tokenization dilemma when processing raw biomolecular sequences - either treating sequences as specialized language (losing functional motifs) or as separate modality (creating alignment challenges), limiting reasoning capacity.

Method: Systematic comparison of leading Sci-LLMs on biological reasoning tasks using three input modes: sequence-only, context-only (structured bioinformatics tool outputs), and combination of both.

Result: Context-only approach consistently and substantially outperforms all other modes. Including raw sequences alongside context degrades performance, indicating sequences act as informational noise even for specialized models.

Conclusion: Sci-LLMs should be reframed as reasoning engines over expert knowledge rather than sequence decoders, with developmental focus shifting from direct sequence interpretation to high-level knowledge synthesis.

Abstract: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) have emerged as a promising
frontier for accelerating biological discovery. However, these models face a
fundamental challenge when processing raw biomolecular sequences: the
tokenization dilemma. Whether treating sequences as a specialized language,
risking the loss of functional motif information, or as a separate modality,
introducing formidable alignment challenges, current strategies fundamentally
limit their reasoning capacity. We challenge this sequence-centric paradigm by
positing that a more effective strategy is to provide Sci-LLMs with high-level
structured context derived from established bioinformatics tools, thereby
bypassing the need to interpret low-level noisy sequence data directly. Through
a systematic comparison of leading Sci-LLMs on biological reasoning tasks, we
tested three input modes: sequence-only, context-only, and a combination of
both. Our findings are striking: the context-only approach consistently and
substantially outperforms all other modes. Even more revealing, the inclusion
of the raw sequence alongside its high-level context consistently degrades
performance, indicating that raw sequences act as informational noise, even for
models with specialized tokenization schemes. These results suggest that the
primary strength of existing Sci-LLMs lies not in their nascent ability to
interpret biomolecular syntax from scratch, but in their profound capacity for
reasoning over structured, human-readable knowledge. Therefore, we argue for
reframing Sci-LLMs not as sequence decoders, but as powerful reasoning engines
over expert knowledge. This work lays the foundation for a new class of hybrid
scientific AI agents, repositioning the developmental focus from direct
sequence interpretation towards high-level knowledge synthesis. The code is

Motivation: Existing skill discovery methods maximize diversity without considering human preferences, leading to potentially dangerous or undesirable behaviors that don't align with human intentions.

Method: Extracts score functions from foundation models to evaluate states based on human intentions, then re-weights skill discovery rewards using these scores to prioritize desirable behaviors.

Result: Successfully eliminates undesirable behaviors like flipping or rolling, avoids hazardous areas in both state-based and pixel-based tasks, and discovers skills with behaviors difficult to define manually.

Conclusion: FoG effectively incorporates human intentions into skill discovery through foundation models, enabling safer and more desirable skill learning while maintaining diversity.

Abstract: Learning diverse skills without hand-crafted reward functions could
accelerate reinforcement learning in downstream tasks. However, existing skill
discovery methods focus solely on maximizing the diversity of skills without
considering human preferences, which leads to undesirable behaviors and
possibly dangerous skills. For instance, a cheetah robot trained using previous
methods learns to roll in all directions to maximize skill diversity, whereas
we would prefer it to run without flipping or entering hazardous areas. In this
work, we propose a Foundation model Guided (FoG) skill discovery method, which
incorporates human intentions into skill discovery through foundation models.
Specifically, FoG extracts a score function from foundation models to evaluate
states based on human intentions, assigning higher values to desirable states
and lower to undesirable ones. These scores are then used to re-weight the
rewards of skill discovery algorithms. By optimizing the re-weighted skill
discovery rewards, FoG successfully learns to eliminate undesirable behaviors,
such as flipping or rolling, and to avoid hazardous areas in both state-based
and pixel-based tasks. Interestingly, we show that FoG can discover skills
involving behaviors that are difficult to define. Interactive visualisations

### [344] [AUPO -- Abstracted Until Proven Otherwise: A Reward Distribution Based Abstraction Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23214)
*Robin Schmöcker,Alexander Dockhorn,Bodo Rosenhahn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AUPO is a novel drop-in modification to MCTS that uses reward distribution statistics to automatically abstract actions, outperforming standard MCTS on IPPC benchmarks without requiring transition probabilities or DAG structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve MCTS performance by automatically detecting action abstractions and symmetries that existing frameworks like ASAP struggle with, especially when symmetric states are far apart in state space.

Method: AUPO modifies MCTS's decision policy using reward distribution statistics collected during search to automatically abstract actions, without needing transition probabilities or directed acyclic graphs.

Result: AUPO clearly outperforms standard MCTS on a range of IPPC benchmark problems and can detect symmetric actions that state-of-the-art frameworks like ASAP struggle with.

Conclusion: AUPO provides an effective drop-in enhancement to MCTS that works alongside other abstraction techniques, offering improved performance through automatic action abstraction based solely on reward statistics.

Abstract: We introduce a novel, drop-in modification to Monte Carlo Tree Search's
(MCTS) decision policy that we call AUPO. Comparisons based on a range of IPPC
benchmark problems show that AUPO clearly outperforms MCTS. AUPO is an
automatic action abstraction algorithm that solely relies on reward
distribution statistics acquired during the MCTS. Thus, unlike other automatic
abstraction algorithms, AUPO requires neither access to transition
probabilities nor does AUPO require a directed acyclic search graph to build
its abstraction, allowing AUPO to detect symmetric actions that
state-of-the-art frameworks like ASAP struggle with when the resulting
symmetric states are far apart in state space. Furthermore, as AUPO only
affects the decision policy, it is not mutually exclusive with other
abstraction techniques that only affect the tree search.

TL;DR: A sample-efficient DRL method for training human-like game AI that improves training speed by 50% and outperforms built-in game AI by 10% in ball saving rate, with plans to replace hand-crafted agents in future game iterations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DRL has rarely been used in game industry due to impractical large models for super-human agents, while studios need human-like agents with limited resources.

Method: Sample-efficient DRL method leveraging pre-collected data and increasing network plasticity to improve training efficiency for value-based DRL.

Result: Goalkeeper agent in EA SPORTS FC 25 outperforms built-in AI by 10% in ball saving rate, trains 50% faster than standard DRL, and creates more human-like gameplay according to experts.

Conclusion: The method successfully addresses industry needs for practical DRL deployment and is intended to replace hand-crafted agents in future game releases.

Abstract: While several high profile video games have served as testbeds for Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL), this technique has rarely been employed by the
game industry for crafting authentic AI behaviors. Previous research focuses on
training super-human agents with large models, which is impractical for game
studios with limited resources aiming for human-like agents. This paper
proposes a sample-efficient DRL method tailored for training and fine-tuning
agents in industrial settings such as the video game industry. Our method
improves sample efficiency of value-based DRL by leveraging pre-collected data
and increasing network plasticity. We evaluate our method training a goalkeeper
agent in EA SPORTS FC 25, one of the best-selling football simulations today.
Our agent outperforms the game's built-in AI by 10% in ball saving rate.
Ablation studies show that our method trains agents 50% faster compared to
standard DRL methods. Finally, qualitative evaluation from domain experts
indicates that our approach creates more human-like gameplay compared to
hand-crafted agents. As a testimony of the impact of the approach, the method
is intended to replace the hand-crafted counterpart in next iterations of the
series.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BlocKOA is a novel algorithm that accelerates IC thermal simulation data generation by using block Krylov methods and operator actions, achieving 420x speedup while maintaining data quality for training neural operators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural operator approaches for IC thermal simulation require large amounts of high-fidelity training data, which incurs significant computational costs for data generation.

Method: BlocKOA uses block Krylov algorithm based on heat equation structure to obtain basic solutions, combines them to generate temperature distributions satisfying physical constraints, then applies heat operators to determine heat source distributions.

Result: BlocKOA achieves 420-fold speedup in generating thermal simulation data for 5000 chips. Data-driven approaches trained on BlocKOA-generated data show comparable performance using only 4% of generation time compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: BlocKOA efficiently generates precise IC thermal simulation data with significantly reduced computational cost, enabling faster training of data-driven approaches while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in data-driven approaches, such as neural operators (NOs),
have shown substantial efficacy in reducing the solution time for integrated
circuit (IC) thermal simulations. However, a limitation of these approaches is
requiring a large amount of high-fidelity training data, such as chip
parameters and temperature distributions, thereby incurring significant
computational costs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel algorithm
for the generation of IC thermal simulation data, named block Krylov and
operator action (BlocKOA), which simultaneously accelerates the data generation
process and enhances the precision of generated data. BlocKOA is specifically
designed for IC applications. Initially, we use the block Krylov algorithm
based on the structure of the heat equation to quickly obtain a few basic
solutions. Then we combine them to get numerous temperature distributions that
satisfy the physical constraints. Finally, we apply heat operators on these
functions to determine the heat source distributions, efficiently generating
precise data points. Theoretical analysis shows that the time complexity of
BlocKOA is one order lower than the existing method. Experimental results
further validate its efficiency, showing that BlocKOA achieves a 420-fold
speedup in generating thermal simulation data for 5000 chips with varying
physical parameters and IC structures. Even with just 4% of the generation
time, data-driven approaches trained on the data generated by BlocKOA exhibits
comparable performance to that using the existing method.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning approach for CNOT gate minimization in quantum circuits that uses a single agent trained on fixed-size circuits and generalizes to different sizes through preprocessing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNOT gates are fundamental for quantum entanglement but minimizing their number is computationally challenging and not fully characterized, requiring efficient optimization methods.

Method: Single reinforcement learning agent trained on fixed-size circuits (m=8), with preprocessing using embedding or Gaussian striping for different matrix sizes.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms as circuit size increases (n=3 to 15), showing better scalability.

Conclusion: The reinforcement learning approach provides an effective solution for CNOT minimization that generalizes well across different circuit sizes and improves upon existing methods.

Abstract: CNOT gates are fundamental to quantum computing, as they facilitate
entanglement, a crucial resource for quantum algorithms. Certain classes of
quantum circuits are constructed exclusively from CNOT gates. Given their
widespread use, it is imperative to minimise the number of CNOT gates employed.
This problem, known as CNOT minimisation, remains an open challenge, with its
computational complexity yet to be fully characterised. In this work, we
introduce a novel reinforcement learning approach to address this task. Instead
of training multiple reinforcement learning agents for different circuit sizes,
we use a single agent up to a fixed size $m$. Matrices of sizes different from
m are preprocessed using either embedding or Gaussian striping. To assess the
efficacy of our approach, we trained an agent with m = 8, and evaluated it on
matrices of size n that range from 3 to 15. The results we obtained show that
our method overperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm as the value of n
increases.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive signaling framework for human-AI collaboration that optimizes message timing and specificity using Bayesian reference resolution and Rational Speech Act modeling to maintain user belief alignment with dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve human-AI collaboration on time-sensitive tasks in rapidly changing environments by ensuring humans maintain accurate understanding of critical task elements, considering human attention as a zero-sum cognitive resource.

Method: Uses Bayesian reference resolution with Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework to plan message sequences that optimize timely belief alignment. Adapts message specificity and timing based on user and scenario projections of how message interpretation influences attention and belief updates over multiple timesteps.

Result: Shows that effectiveness crucially depends on combining multi-step planning with realistic models of user awareness. Establishes the first application of RSA for communication in dynamic environments and human-AI interaction.

Conclusion: Establishes theoretical foundations for pragmatic communication in human-agent teams, demonstrating how cognitive science insights can inform assistive agent design for effective human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Adaptive agent design offers a way to improve human-AI collaboration on
time-sensitive tasks in rapidly changing environments. In such cases, to ensure
the human maintains an accurate understanding of critical task elements, an
assistive agent must not only identify the highest priority information but
also estimate how and when this information can be communicated most
effectively, given that human attention represents a zero-sum cognitive
resource where focus on one message diminishes awareness of other or upcoming
information. We introduce a theoretical framework for adaptive signalling which
meets these challenges by using principles of rational communication,
formalised as Bayesian reference resolution using the Rational Speech Act (RSA)
modelling framework, to plan a sequence of messages which optimise timely
alignment between user belief and a dynamic environment. The agent adapts
message specificity and timing to the particulars of a user and scenario based
on projections of how prior-guided interpretation of messages will influence
attention to the interface and subsequent belief update, across several
timesteps out to a fixed horizon. In a comparison to baseline methods, we show
that this effectiveness depends crucially on combining multi-step planning with
a realistic model of user awareness. As the first application of RSA for
communication in a dynamic environment, and for human-AI interaction in
general, we establish theoretical foundations for pragmatic communication in
human-agent teams, highlighting how insights from cognitive science can be
capitalised to inform the design of assistive agents.

*Pratik N. Kalamkar,A. G. Phakatkar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method for opinion mining at a deeper granularity level using fuzzy logic reasoning, followed by entity ranking based on the extracted information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the growth of social networking and e-commerce sites, huge amounts of opinions are available online. While existing research has focused on basic opinion mining and entity ranking, there is a gap in classifying opinions into finer granularity levels and then ranking entities.

Method: The proposed method uses fuzzy logic reasoning to perform opinion mining from statements at a deeper level of granularity, extracting attributes and components of entities that have been commented on, and determining sentiment polarity (positive, negative, or neutral).

Result: The method enables more detailed opinion analysis by working at a finer granularity level than previous approaches.

Conclusion: This approach represents a novel contribution by combining fine-grained opinion classification with entity ranking, addressing a previously unexplored area in opinion mining research.

Abstract: Opinions are central to almost all human activities and are key influencers
of our behaviors. In current times due to growth of social networking website
and increase in number of e-commerce site huge amount of opinions are now
available on web. Given a set of evaluative statements that contain opinions
(or sentiments) about an Entity, opinion mining aims to extract attributes and
components of the object that have been commented on in each statement and to
determine whether the comments are positive, negative or neutral. While lot of
research recently has been done in field of opinion mining and some of it
dealing with ranking of entities based on review or opinion set, classifying
opinions into finer granularity level and then ranking entities has never been
done before. In this paper method for opinion mining from statements at a
deeper level of granularity is proposed. This is done by using fuzzy logic
reasoning, after which entities are ranked as per this information.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Bid2X is a bidding foundation model that learns a unified function to estimate advertising effects across different scenarios, using attention mechanisms and zero-inflated projection for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous auto-bidding models lack generalizability across different bidding environments as they are tailored for specific scenarios. The authors aim to create a scenario-independent model that can work across various advertising contexts.

Method: Built uniform series embeddings for heterogeneous data, used two attention mechanisms for inter-variable and temporal dependencies, employed variable-aware fusion for adaptive prediction, and devised zero-inflated projection module with joint classification-regression optimization.

Result: Offline evaluation on eight datasets showed superiority over baselines and cross-scenario generality. Online A/B tests on Taobao increased GMV by 4.65% and ROI by 2.44%.

Conclusion: Bid2X successfully creates a bidding foundation model that generalizes across scenarios and significantly improves advertising performance metrics, paving the way for foundation models in computational advertising.

Abstract: Auto-bidding is crucial in facilitating online advertising by automatically
providing bids for advertisers. While previous work has made great efforts to
model bidding environments for better ad performance, it has limitations in
generalizability across environments since these models are typically tailored
for specific bidding scenarios. To this end, we approach the
scenario-independent principles through a unified function that estimates the
achieved effect under specific bids, such as budget consumption, gross
merchandise volume (GMV), page views, etc. Then, we propose a bidding
foundation model Bid2X to learn this fundamental function from data in various
scenarios. Our Bid2X is built over uniform series embeddings that encode
heterogeneous data through tailored embedding methods. To capture complex
inter-variable and dynamic temporal dependencies in bidding data, we propose
two attention mechanisms separately treating embeddings of different variables
and embeddings at different times as attention tokens for representation
learning. On top of the learned variable and temporal representations, a
variable-aware fusion module is used to perform adaptive bidding outcome
prediction. To model the unique bidding data distribution, we devise a
zero-inflated projection module to incorporate the estimated non-zero
probability into its value prediction, which makes up a joint optimization
objective containing classification and regression. The objective is proven to
converge to the zero-inflated distribution. Our model has been deployed on the
ad platform in Taobao, one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms. Offline
evaluation on eight datasets exhibits Bid2X's superiority compared to various
baselines and its generality across different scenarios. Bid2X increased GMV by
4.65% and ROI by 2.44% in online A/B tests, paving the way for bidding
foundation model in computational advertising.

Motivation: DQNs' reliance on associative learning leads to spurious correlations that hinder performance, motivating the need for causal reasoning.

Method: Proposed framework integrates causal principles into DQNs using PEACE formula for causal effect estimation during training.

Result: Enhanced DQN performance on standard benchmarks, outperforming conventional DQNs while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: Causal reasoning integration presents a promising approach for advancing deep reinforcement learning agents' capabilities.

Abstract: Deep Q Networks (DQN) have shown remarkable success in various reinforcement
learning tasks. However, their reliance on associative learning often leads to
the acquisition of spurious correlations, hindering their problem-solving
capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to integrate causal
principles into DQNs, leveraging the PEACE (Probabilistic Easy vAriational
Causal Effect) formula for estimating causal effects. By incorporating causal
reasoning during training, our proposed framework enhances the DQN's
understanding of the underlying causal structure of the environment, thereby
mitigating the influence of confounding factors and spurious correlations. We
demonstrate that integrating DQNs with causal capabilities significantly
enhances their problem-solving capabilities without compromising performance.
Experimental results on standard benchmark environments showcase that our
approach outperforms conventional DQNs, highlighting the effectiveness of
causal reasoning in reinforcement learning. Overall, our work presents a
promising avenue for advancing the capabilities of deep reinforcement learning
agents through principled causal inference.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This commentary critiques Cappelen et al.'s AI existential risk model, highlighting philosophical limitations of linear risk models and arguing that probability of disaster P(D) is higher than suggested due to structural relationships between risk layers and two types of uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a philosophical critique of linear AI risk models and demonstrate how incorporating different types of uncertainty can better estimate the probability of AI existential disasters.

Method: Analyzes the Swiss Cheese model used by Cappelen et al., discusses differences from standard models, examines structural relationships between risk layers, and distinguishes between risk and uncertainty (option uncertainty and state-space uncertainty).

Result: The analysis suggests that P(D) is likely higher than initially estimated due to epistemic indifference and structural interconnections between risk layers, and that incorporating uncertainty dimensions improves understanding of AI existential risk likelihood.

Conclusion: Qualitative discussions on AI existential risk should incorporate option and state-space uncertainty to achieve more accurate probability estimates of disaster scenarios, moving beyond simplistic linear risk models.

Abstract: This work is a commentary of the article
\href{https://doi.org/10.18716/ojs/phai/2025.2801}{AI Survival Stories: a
Taxonomic Analysis of AI Existential Risk} by Cappelen, Goldstein, and
Hawthorne. It is not just a commentary though, but a useful reminder of the
philosophical limitations of \say{linear} models of risk. The article will
focus on the model employed by the authors: first, I discuss some differences
between standard Swiss Cheese models and this one. I then argue that in a
situation of epistemic indifference the probability of P(D) is higher than what
one might first suggest, given the structural relationships between layers. I
then distinguish between risk and uncertainty, and argue that any estimation of
P(D) is structurally affected by two kinds of uncertainty: option uncertainty
and state-space uncertainty. Incorporating these dimensions of uncertainty into
our qualitative discussion on AI existential risk can provide a better
understanding of the likeliness of P(D).

Conclusion: Policy constrained LLM reasoning combined with explicit gates and audit trails can effectively translate human readable policies into safe, compliant, and traceable machine decisions.

Abstract: Enterprises need access decisions that satisfy least privilege, comply with
regulations, and remain auditable. We present a policy aware controller that
uses a large language model (LLM) to interpret natural language requests
against written policies and metadata, not raw data. The system, implemented
with Google Gemini~2.0 Flash, executes a six-stage reasoning framework (context
interpretation, user validation, data classification, business purpose test,
compliance mapping, and risk synthesis) with early hard policy gates and deny
by default. It returns APPROVE, DENY, CONDITIONAL together with cited controls
and a machine readable rationale. We evaluate on fourteen canonical cases
across seven scenario families using a privacy preserving benchmark. Results
show Exact Decision Match improving from 10/14 to 13/14 (92.9\%) after applying
policy gates, DENY recall rising to 1.00, False Approval Rate on must-deny
families dropping to 0, and Functional Appropriateness and Compliance Adherence
at 14/14. Expert ratings of rationale quality are high, and median latency is

TL;DR: This paper introduces Human AI Collaborative Uncertainty Quantification, a framework that combines human expertise with AI predictions to create optimal prediction sets while avoiding counterfactual harm and ensuring complementarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems lack capabilities like domain knowledge, long-horizon context, and physical world reasoning needed for robust decisions under uncertainty, motivating the need for collaborative human-AI frameworks.

Method: The framework formalizes how AI can refine human expert's prediction sets using a two-threshold structure over a single score function, with offline and online calibration algorithms that have provable distribution-free finite sample guarantees.

Result: Experiments across image classification, regression, and medical decision making show collaborative prediction sets consistently outperform either agent alone, achieving higher coverage and smaller set sizes across various conditions.

Conclusion: Human-AI collaborative uncertainty quantification provides a principled approach to combine complementary strengths of humans and AI for reliable decision making under uncertainty, with practical algorithms that adapt to distribution shifts including human behavior evolution.

Abstract: AI predictive systems are increasingly embedded in decision making pipelines,
shaping high stakes choices once made solely by humans. Yet robust decisions
under uncertainty still rely on capabilities that current AI lacks: domain
knowledge not captured by data, long horizon context, and reasoning grounded in
the physical world. This gap has motivated growing efforts to design
collaborative frameworks that combine the complementary strengths of humans and
AI. This work advances this vision by identifying the fundamental principles of
Human AI collaboration within uncertainty quantification, a key component of
reliable decision making. We introduce Human AI Collaborative Uncertainty
Quantification, a framework that formalizes how an AI model can refine a human
expert's proposed prediction set with two goals: avoiding counterfactual harm,
ensuring the AI does not degrade correct human judgments, and complementarity,
enabling recovery of correct outcomes the human missed. At the population
level, we show that the optimal collaborative prediction set follows an
intuitive two threshold structure over a single score function, extending a
classical result in conformal prediction. Building on this insight, we develop
practical offline and online calibration algorithms with provable distribution
free finite sample guarantees. The online method adapts to distribution shifts,
including human behavior evolving through interaction with AI, a phenomenon we
call Human to AI Adaptation. Experiments across image classification,
regression, and text based medical decision making show that collaborative
prediction sets consistently outperform either agent alone, achieving higher
coverage and smaller set sizes across various conditions.

TL;DR: The paper establishes a formal equivalence between AI agent architectures and Chomsky hierarchy automata, showing reflex agents = Finite Automata, hierarchical agents = Pushdown Automata, and reflective memory agents = Turing Machines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a principled methodology for right-sizing agent architectures and create pathways for formal verification of agent safety and predictability.

Method: Mapping agent memory architectures to corresponding automata classes in the Chomsky hierarchy, extending the framework to probabilistic automata for LLM-based agents.

Result: Created an Automata-Agent Framework that formally delineates boundaries between verifiable and undecidable systems, enabling application of automata theory techniques.

Conclusion: Outlines an agenda for developing static analysis tools and grammars for agentic frameworks based on the established automata equivalences.

Abstract: This paper establishes a formal equivalence between the architectural classes
of modern agentic AI systems and the abstract machines of the Chomsky
hierarchy. We posit that the memory architecture of an AI agent is the
definitive feature determining its computational power and that it directly
maps it to a corresponding class of automaton. Specifically, we demonstrate
that simple reflex agents are equivalent to Finite Automata, hierarchical
task-decomposition agents are equivalent to Pushdown Automata, and agents
employing readable/writable memory for reflection are equivalent to TMs. This
Automata-Agent Framework provides a principled methodology for right-sizing
agent architectures to optimize computational efficiency and cost. More
critically, it creates a direct pathway to formal verification, enables the
application of mature techniques from automata theory to guarantee agent safety
and predictability. By classifying agents, we can formally delineate the
boundary between verifiable systems and those whose behavior is fundamentally
undecidable. We address the inherent probabilistic nature of LLM-based agents
by extending the framework to probabilistic automata that allow quantitative
risk analysis. The paper concludes by outlining an agenda for developing static
analysis tools and grammars for agentic frameworks.

Method: Introduces Emotional Rationale Verifier (ERV) and Explanation Reward to guide models to produce reasoning explicitly consistent with target emotions during multimodal emotion recognition.

Result: Significantly improves faithful explanation-prediction consistency and explanation emotion accuracy on MAFW and DFEW datasets through experiments and human evaluations.

Conclusion: The approach enhances alignment between explanations and predictions, enabling MLLMs to deliver emotionally coherent and trustworthy interactions, advancing toward human-like HCI systems.

Abstract: The recent advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is
transforming human-computer interaction (HCI) from surface-level exchanges into
more nuanced and emotionally intelligent communication. To realize this shift,
emotion understanding becomes essential allowing systems to capture subtle cues
underlying user intent. Furthermore, providing faithful explanations for
predicted emotions is crucial to ensure interpretability and build user trust.
However, current MLLM-based methods often generate emotion explanations that
diverge from the target labels and sometimes even contradict their own
predicted emotions. This inconsistency poses a critical risk for
misunderstanding and erodes reliability in interactive settings. To address
this, we propose a novel approach: the Emotional Rationale Verifier (ERV) and
an Explanation Reward. Our method guides the model to produce reasoning that is
explicitly consistent with the target emotion during multimodal emotion
recognition without modifying the model architecture or requiring additional
paired video-description annotations. Our method significantly improves
faithful explanation-prediction consistency and explanation emotion accuracy on
the MAFW and DFEW datasets. Through extensive experiments and human
evaluations, we show that our approach not only enhances alignment between
explanation and prediction but also empowers MLLMs to deliver emotionally
coherent, trustworthy interactions, marking a key step toward truly human-like
HCI systems.

*Anirban Das,Irtaza Khalid,Rafael Peñaloza,Steven Schockaert*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NoRA is a new benchmark for systematic relational reasoning that introduces multiple difficulty levels and requires models to go beyond simple path-based reasoning, addressing limitations in existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for systematic relational reasoning are overly simplified and assume reasoning can be reduced to composing relational paths, which limits model generalization and progress in the field.

Method: The authors introduce NoRA benchmark with several levels of difficulty that challenge models to perform reasoning beyond simple path-based approaches.

Result: NoRA provides a more comprehensive evaluation framework that can better assess models' true systematic reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: NoRA enables further progress in systematic relational reasoning by providing a more challenging and realistic benchmark that moves beyond path-based reasoning limitations.

Abstract: Designing models that can learn to reason in a systematic way is an important
and long-standing challenge. In recent years, a wide range of solutions have
been proposed for the specific case of systematic relational reasoning,
including Neuro-Symbolic approaches, variants of the Transformer architecture,
and specialised Graph Neural Networks. However, existing benchmarks for
systematic relational reasoning focus on an overly simplified setting, based on
the assumption that reasoning can be reduced to composing relational paths. In
fact, this assumption is hard-baked into the architecture of several recent
models, leading to approaches that can perform well on existing benchmarks but
are difficult to generalise to other settings. To support further progress in
the field of systematic relational reasoning with neural networks, we introduce
NoRA, a new benchmark which adds several levels of difficulty and requires
models to go beyond path-based reasoning.

TL;DR: JanusCode-800K is the largest multimodal code corpus enabling JanusCoder models to generate code from text, visual inputs, or both, achieving state-of-the-art performance on coding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scarcity of high-quality multimodal code data needed for advanced applications like content generation and program-driven visualization editing.

Method: Developed a synthesis toolkit to create JanusCode-800K corpus, then trained JanusCoder and JanusCoderV models that can process text, visual inputs, or both for code generation.

Result: JanusCoder models (7B to 14B scale) approach or exceed commercial model performance on both text-centric and vision-centric coding tasks.

Conclusion: The work establishes a visual-programmatic interface and provides insights into harmonizing programmatic logic with visual expression, with models and code publicly available.

Abstract: The scope of neural code intelligence is rapidly expanding beyond text-based
source code to encompass the rich visual outputs that programs generate. This
visual dimension is critical for advanced applications like flexible content
generation and precise, program-driven editing of visualizations. However,
progress has been impeded by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal code data,
a bottleneck stemming from challenges in synthesis and quality assessment. To
address these challenges, we make contributions from both a data and modeling
perspective. We first introduce a complete synthesis toolkit that leverages
reciprocal synergies between data modalities to efficiently produce a
large-scale, high-quality corpus spanning from standard charts to complex
interactive web UIs and code-driven animations. Leveraging this toolkit, we
construct JanusCode-800K, the largest multimodal code corpus to date. This
powers the training of our models, JanusCoder and JanusCoderV, which establish
a visual-programmatic interface for generating code from textual instructions,
visual inputs, or a combination of both. Our unified model is a departure from
existing approaches that build specialized models for isolated tasks. Extensive
experiments on both text-centric and vision-centric coding tasks demonstrate
the superior performance of the JanusCoder series, with our 7B to 14B scale
models approaching or even exceeding the performance of commercial models.
Furthermore, extensive analysis provides key insights into harmonizing
programmatic logic with its visual expression. Our code and checkpoints will
are available at https://github.com/InternLM/JanusCoder.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for machines to safely and effectively interpret complex human behaviors in human-machine teaming paradigms like Industry 5.0, addressing the gap between robotic frameworks lacking nuanced human behavior models and descriptive ontologies not designed for real-time collaboration.

Method: Grounded in cognitive science and modular engineering methodology, OntoPret provides a formal, machine-processable framework for classifying behaviors including task deviations and deceptive actions.

Result: Demonstrated adaptability across two distinct use cases (manufacturing and gameplay) and established semantic foundations necessary for advanced reasoning about human intentions.

Conclusion: OntoPret successfully bridges the research gap by providing a practical ontology that enables machines to interpret human behaviors in real-time collaborative settings.

Abstract: As human machine teaming becomes central to paradigms like Industry 5.0, a
critical need arises for machines to safely and effectively interpret complex
human behaviors. A research gap currently exists between techno centric robotic
frameworks, which often lack nuanced models of human behavior, and descriptive
behavioral ontologies, which are not designed for real time, collaborative
interpretation. This paper addresses this gap by presenting OntoPret, an
ontology for the interpretation of human behavior. Grounded in cognitive
science and a modular engineering methodology, OntoPret provides a formal,
machine processable framework for classifying behaviors, including task
deviations and deceptive actions. We demonstrate its adaptability across two
distinct use cases manufacturing and gameplay and establish the semantic
foundations necessary for advanced reasoning about human intentions.

*Zhaoyang Yu,Jiayi Zhang,Huixue Su,Yufan Zhao,Yifan Wu,Mingyi Deng,Jinyu Xiang,Yizhang Lin,Lingxiao Tang,Yingchao Li,Yuyu Luo,Bang Liu,Chenglin Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReCode is a novel paradigm that unifies planning and action through recursive code generation, enabling LLM agents to operate fluidly across decision granularities by treating high-level plans as abstract functions that are recursively decomposed into primitive actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based agents lack the ability to operate across different decision granularities due to rigid separation between high-level planning and low-level action, which limits their dynamic adaptability and generalization capabilities.

Method: ReCode treats high-level plans as abstract placeholder functions and recursively decomposes them into finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions, using a unified code representation that dissolves the boundary between planning and action.

Result: Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly surpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates exceptional data efficiency in training, validating the effectiveness of unifying planning and action through recursive code generation.

Conclusion: Unifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful and effective approach to achieving universal granularity control in LLM agents, enabling them to dynamically control decision granularity and learn hierarchical decision-making processes.

Abstract: Real-world tasks require decisions at varying granularities, and humans excel
at this by leveraging a unified cognitive representation where planning is
fundamentally understood as a high-level form of action. However, current Large
Language Model (LLM)-based agents lack this crucial capability to operate
fluidly across decision granularities. This limitation stems from existing
paradigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and
low-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization.
We propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses
this limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code
representation. In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as
abstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes
into finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions. This
recursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action,
enabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity.
Furthermore, the recursive structure inherently generates rich,
multi-granularity training data, enabling models to learn hierarchical
decision-making processes. Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly
surpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates
exceptional data efficiency in training, validating our core insight that
unifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful
and effective approach to achieving universal granularity control. The code is
available at https://github.com/FoundationAgents/ReCode.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The GenAI boom, particularly after ChatGPT's launch, led to reduced public acceptance of AI and increased demand for human oversight in decision-making, while amplifying social inequalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine shifts in public attitudes toward AI before and after the launch of ChatGPT, as organizations rapidly integrate AI without considering user preferences.

Method: Large-scale two-wave survey study (n_wave1=1514, n_wave2=1488) representative of the Swiss population, comparing attitudes pre- and post-ChatGPT launch.

Result: Significant reduction in AI acceptance (23% to 30% finding AI 'not acceptable at all') and increased support for human-only decision-making (18% to 26%). The GenAI boom amplified educational, linguistic, and gender gaps.

Conclusion: Findings challenge industry assumptions about public readiness for AI deployment and highlight the need to align technological development with evolving public preferences.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies
has led many organizations to integrate AI into their products and services,
often without considering user preferences. Yet, public attitudes toward AI
use, especially in impactful decision-making scenarios, are underexplored.
Using a large-scale two-wave survey study (n_wave1=1514, n_wave2=1488)
representative of the Swiss population, we examine shifts in public attitudes
toward AI before and after the launch of ChatGPT. We find that the GenAI boom
is significantly associated with reduced public acceptance of AI (see Figure 1)
and increased demand for human oversight in various decision-making contexts.
The proportion of respondents finding AI "not acceptable at all" increased from
23% to 30%, while support for human-only decision-making rose from 18% to 26%.
These shifts have amplified existing social inequalities in terms of widened
educational, linguistic, and gender gaps post-boom. Our findings challenge
industry assumptions about public readiness for AI deployment and highlight the
critical importance of aligning technological development with evolving public
preferences.

TL;DR: MAE is a multi-agent self-evolution framework that uses three interacting agents (Proposer, Solver, Judge) instantiated from a single LLM to enhance reasoning capabilities without human-annotated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods for LLMs rely heavily on human-curated datasets and verifiable rewards, limiting scalability. Self-play RL methods require grounded environments, making extension to general domains challenging.

Method: MAE employs a triplet of agents (Proposer, Solver, Judge) from a single LLM that co-evolve through reinforcement learning. The Proposer generates questions, Solver provides solutions, and Judge evaluates both.

Result: Experiments on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct show an average improvement of 4.54% across multiple benchmarks in mathematics, reasoning, and general knowledge Q&A.

Conclusion: MAE provides a scalable, data-efficient method for enhancing LLM reasoning abilities with minimal human supervision, demonstrating effectiveness across diverse domains.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated significant potential in
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However,
the success of RL for LLMs heavily relies on human-curated datasets and
verifiable rewards, which limit their scalability and generality. Recent
Self-Play RL methods, inspired by the success of the paradigm in games and Go,
aim to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities without human-annotated data.
However, their methods primarily depend on a grounded environment for feedback
(e.g., a Python interpreter or a game engine); extending them to general
domains remains challenging. To address these challenges, we propose
Multi-Agent Evolve (MAE), a framework that enables LLMs to self-evolve in
solving diverse tasks, including mathematics, reasoning, and general knowledge
Q&A. The core design of MAE is based on a triplet of interacting agents
(Proposer, Solver, Judge) that are instantiated from a single LLM, and applies
reinforcement learning to optimize their behaviors. The Proposer generates
questions, the Solver attempts solutions, and the Judge evaluates both while
co-evolving. Experiments on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct demonstrate that MAE achieves
an average improvement of 4.54% on multiple benchmarks. These results highlight
MAE as a scalable, data-efficient method for enhancing the general reasoning
abilities of LLMs with minimal reliance on human-curated supervision.

TL;DR: ALITA-G is a self-evolution framework that transforms general-purpose LLM agents into domain experts by systematically generating, abstracting, and curating Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools from successful task trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-evolving agents are limited to prompt rewriting or failure retries, lacking systematic adaptation. The authors aim to create a principled pathway for transforming generalist agents into domain-specific experts with reusable competence.

Method: The framework has a generalist agent execute domain tasks and synthesize candidate MCPs from successful trajectories. These are abstracted to parameterized primitives and consolidated into an MCP Box. At inference, it performs retrieval-augmented MCP selection using tool descriptions and use cases, then executes with an MCP Executor.

Result: ALITA-G achieves state-of-the-art results: 83.03% pass@1 and 89.09% pass@3 on GAIA validation, while reducing mean tokens per example by ~15% compared to strong baselines. It also shows strong gains on PathVQA and Humanity's Last Exam benchmarks.

Conclusion: ALITA-G provides a principled pathway from generalist capability to reusable, domain-specific competence, improving both accuracy and efficiency on complex reasoning tasks through systematic tool generation and curation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to perform better when
scaffolded into agents with memory, tools, and feedback. Beyond this,
self-evolving agents have emerged, but current work largely limits adaptation
to prompt rewriting or failure retries. Therefore, we present ALITA-G, a
self-evolution framework that transforms a general-purpose agent into a domain
expert by systematically generating, abstracting, and curating Model Context
Protocol (MCP) tools. In this framework, a generalist agent executes a curated
suite of target-domain tasks and synthesizes candidate MCPs from successful
trajectories. These are then abstracted to parameterized primitives and
consolidated into an MCP Box. At inference time, ALITA-G performs
retrieval-augmented MCP selection with the help of each tool's descriptions and
use cases, before executing an agent equipped with the MCP Executor. Across
several benchmarks GAIA, PathVQA, and Humanity's Last Exam, ALITA-G attains
strong gains while reducing computation costs. On GAIA validation, it achieves
83.03% pass@1 and 89.09% pass@3, establishing a new state-of-the-art result
while reducing mean tokens per example by approximately 15% relative to a
strong baseline agent. ALITA-G thus provides a principled pathway from
generalist capability to reusable, domain-specific competence, improving both
accuracy and efficiency on complex reasoning tasks.
