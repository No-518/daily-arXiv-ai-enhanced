### [1] [What Happens When: Learning Temporal Orders of Events in Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08979)
*Daechul Ahn,Yura Choi,Hyeonbeom Choi,Seongwon Cho,San Kim,Jonghyun Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMMs struggle with temporal event ordering despite good performance on existing benchmarks; VECTOR benchmark reveals this weakness; MECOT method improves temporal understanding via event-by-event training and chain-of-thought prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video Large Multimodal Models (VLMMs) show impressive video understanding but their ability to capture temporal order of multiple events is underexplored. Models perform well even on scrambled frames, suggesting they rely on prior knowledge rather than sequential processing.

Method: Proposes VECTOR benchmark to assess temporal order understanding, and MECOT method: (1) trains models on detailed event-by-event video descriptions, (2) uses chain-of-thought prompts at inference to enhance temporal awareness.

Result: Various VLMMs often fail to understand event orders on VECTOR benchmark. MECOT outperforms prior methods on VECTOR and improves performance on existing video benchmarks, demonstrating effectiveness for temporal understanding.

Conclusion: VLMMs have limitations in temporal event ordering despite good overall performance. The proposed VECTOR benchmark and MECOT method effectively address this gap, improving temporal understanding capabilities in video models.

Abstract: Video Large Multimodal Models (VLMMs) have shown impressive performance in video understanding, yet their ability to accurately capture the temporal order of multiple events remains underexplored. We interestingly observe that, even when video frames are scrambled, models perform very well on the existing benchmarks by comprehensive experiments. This implies that VLMMs may not necessarily rely on accurate sequential processing of visual events, but instead depend on prior knowledge of typical scenarios to answer the question. To benchmark temporal understanding capabilities in VLMMs, we propose VECTOR, designed to explicitly assess a model's ability to identify the temporal order of events. On this benchmark, we observe that various VLMMs often fail to understand the orders of events. To address this, we propose MECOT (Multi-Event instruction fine-tuning with Chain-of-Thought), which (1) trains models on detailed, event-by-event video descriptions and (2) using chain-of-thought prompts at inference to enhance temporal awareness. MECOT outperforms prior arts on VECTOR as well as improving performance on existing video benchmarks, implying effectiveness of temporal understanding. We release our code, model and datasets.

*Chengqi Dong,Chuhuai Yue,Hang He,Rongge Mao,Fenghe Tang,S Kevin Zhou,Zekun Xu,Xiaohan Wang,Jiajun Chai,Wei Lin,Guojun Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IMAgent is an open-source vision agent trained via end-to-end RL for complex multi-image QA tasks, using multi-agent generated data and specialized visual tools to maintain visual attention during reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current open-source VLM-based agents are limited to single-image inputs and fail on real-world multi-image QA tasks, while also suffering from visual attention degradation during deeper reasoning steps.

Method: Uses multi-agent system to generate challenging multi-image QA pairs (MIFG-QA dataset), develops specialized tools for visual reflection and confirmation, and employs action-trajectory two-level mask strategy for stable RL training without supervised fine-tuning.

Result: IMAgent maintains strong performance on existing single-image benchmarks while achieving substantial improvements on the proposed multi-image dataset, demonstrating effective multi-image reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: IMAgent addresses the multi-image QA gap in open-source vision agents through innovative RL training, specialized visual tools, and high-quality multi-image data generation, providing actionable insights for the research community.

Abstract: Recent VLM-based agents aim to replicate OpenAI O3's ``thinking with images" via tool use, but most open-source methods limit input to a single image, falling short on real-world multi-image QA tasks. To address this, we propose IMAgent, an open-source vision agent trained via end-to-end reinforcement learning dedicated for complex multi-image tasks. By leveraging a multi-agent system, we generate challenging and visually-rich multi-image QA pairs to fully activate the tool-use potential of the base VLM. Through manual verification, we obtain MIFG-QA, comprising 10k samples for training and evaluation. With deeper reasoning steps, VLMs may increasingly ignore visual inputs. We therefore develop two specialized tools for visual reflection and confirmation, allowing the model to proactively reallocate its attention to image content during inference. Benefiting from our well-designed action-trajectory two-level mask strategy, IMAgent achieves stable tool use behavior via pure RL training without requiring costly supervised fine-tuning data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IMAgent maintains strong performance on existing single-image benchmarks while achieving substantial improvements on our proposed multi-image dataset, with our analysis providing actionable insights for the research community. Codes and data will be released soon.

### [3] [Mitigating Bias with Words: Inducing Demographic Ambiguity in Face Recognition Templates by Text Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08981)
*Tahar Chettaoui,Naser Damer,Fadi Boutros*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UTIE reduces demographic bias in face recognition by enriching facial embeddings with text-derived features from other demographic groups using vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face recognition systems suffer from demographic biases due to entanglement of demographic-specific information with identity features, causing performance disparities across groups, which is critical in multicultural smart cities.

Method: UTIE uses Vision-Language Models (CLIP, OpenCLIP, SigLIP) to enrich facial embeddings of each demographic group with text-derived demographic features from other groups, inducing demographic ambiguity and emphasizing identity-relevant features.

Result: UTIE consistently reduces bias metrics on RFW and BFW benchmarks while maintaining or even improving face verification accuracy across three different VLMs.

Conclusion: UTIE effectively addresses demographic bias in face recognition by leveraging cross-modal semantic alignment of VLMs to create more neutral demographic representations without compromising verification performance.

Abstract: Face recognition (FR) systems are often prone to demographic biases, partially due to the entanglement of demographic-specific information with identity-relevant features in facial embeddings. This bias is extremely critical in large multicultural cities, especially where biometrics play a major role in smart city infrastructure. The entanglement can cause demographic attributes to overshadow identity cues in the embedding space, resulting in disparities in verification performance across different demographic groups. To address this issue, we propose a novel strategy, Unified Text-Image Embedding (UTIE), which aims to induce demographic ambiguity in face embeddings by enriching them with information related to other demographic groups. This encourages face embeddings to emphasize identity-relevant features and thus promotes fairer verification performance across groups. UTIE leverages the zero-shot capabilities and cross-modal semantic alignment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Given that VLMs are naturally trained to align visual and textual representations, we enrich the facial embeddings of each demographic group with text-derived demographic features extracted from other demographic groups. This encourages a more neutral representation in terms of demographic attributes. We evaluate UTIE using three VLMs, CLIP, OpenCLIP, and SigLIP, on two widely used benchmarks, RFW and BFW, designed to assess bias in FR. Experimental results show that UTIE consistently reduces bias metrics while maintaining, or even improving in several cases, the face verification accuracy.

*Jian Xu,Wei Chen,Shigui Li,Delu Zeng,John Paisley,Qibin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Consist-Retinex adapts consistency models to Retinex-based low-light enhancement, achieving state-of-the-art performance with single-step sampling while requiring significantly less training than diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models for low-light enhancement require hundreds of iterative sampling steps, limiting practical deployment. While consistency models offer one-step generation for unconditional synthesis, their application to conditional enhancement remains unexplored.

Method: Introduces Consist-Retinex with two core innovations: 1) dual-objective consistency loss combining temporal consistency with ground-truth alignment under randomized time sampling, and 2) adaptive noise-emphasized sampling strategy that prioritizes training on large-noise regions essential for one-step conditional generation.

Result: On VE-LOL-L dataset, achieves state-of-the-art performance with single-step sampling (PSNR: 25.51 vs. 23.41, FID: 44.73 vs. 49.59 compared to Diff-Retinex++), while requiring only 1/8 of the training budget relative to the 1000-step Diff-Retinex baseline.

Conclusion: Consist-Retinex successfully adapts consistency modeling to Retinex-based low-light enhancement, enabling efficient one-step conditional generation with superior performance and reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in low-light image enhancement through Retinex-based decomposition, yet their requirement for hundreds of iterative sampling steps severely limits practical deployment. While recent consistency models offer promising one-step generation for \textit{unconditional synthesis}, their application to \textit{conditional enhancement} remains unexplored. We present \textbf{Consist-Retinex}, the first framework adapting consistency modeling to Retinex-based low-light enhancement. Our key insight is that conditional enhancement requires fundamentally different training dynamics than unconditional generation standard consistency training focuses on low-noise regions near the data manifold, while conditional mapping critically depends on large-noise regimes that bridge degraded inputs to enhanced outputs. We introduce two core innovations: (1) a \textbf{dual-objective consistency loss} combining temporal consistency with ground-truth alignment under randomized time sampling, providing full-spectrum supervision for stable convergence; and (2) an \textbf{adaptive noise-emphasized sampling strategy} that prioritizes training on large-noise regions essential for one-step conditional generation. On VE-LOL-L, Consist-Retinex achieves \textbf{state-of-the-art performance with single-step sampling} (\textbf{PSNR: 25.51 vs. 23.41, FID: 44.73 vs. 49.59} compared to Diff-Retinex++), while requiring only \textbf{1/8 of the training budget} relative to the 1000-step Diff-Retinex baseline.

### [5] [HSCP: A Two-Stage Spectral Clustering Framework for Resource-Constrained UAV Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08983)
*Maoyu Wang,Yao Lu,Bo Zhou,Zhuangzhi Chen,Yun Lin,Qi Xuan,Guan Gui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HSCP: Hierarchical Spectral Clustering Pruning framework for extreme compression of UAV RFFI models, achieving 86% parameter reduction and 84% FLOPs reduction while improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional UAV identification methods struggle with feature extraction and real-time requirements in complex environments. Deep learning RFFI approaches have accuracy but face deployment challenges on edge devices due to large model sizes and high computational demands. Existing pruning techniques fail to optimize compression, hardware acceleration, and accuracy simultaneously.

Method: HSCP combines layer pruning with channel pruning using spectral clustering guided by Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA). First stage removes redundant layers via CKA-guided spectral clustering, second stage applies same strategy to channel dimension for finer redundancy elimination. Includes noise-robust fine-tuning for robustness.

Result: On UAV-M100 benchmark, HSCP outperforms existing channel and layer pruning methods. Achieves 86.39% parameter reduction and 84.44% FLOPs reduction on ResNet18 while improving accuracy by 1.49% compared to unpruned baseline. Maintains superior robustness in low signal-to-noise ratio environments.

Conclusion: HSCP successfully addresses the trade-off between compression rate, hardware acceleration, and recognition accuracy for UAV RFFI models, enabling efficient deployment on resource-constrained edge devices while maintaining and even improving performance.

Abstract: With the rapid development of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and the increasing complexity of low-altitude security threats, traditional UAV identification methods struggle to extract reliable signal features and meet real-time requirements in complex environments. Recently, deep learning based Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification (RFFI) approaches have greatly improved recognition accuracy. However, their large model sizes and high computational demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. While model pruning offers a general solution for complexity reduction, existing weight, channel, and layer pruning techniques struggle to concurrently optimize compression rate, hardware acceleration, and recognition accuracy. To this end, in this paper, we introduce HSCP, a Hierarchical Spectral Clustering Pruning framework that combines layer pruning with channel pruning to achieve extreme compression, high performance, and efficient inference. In the first stage, HSCP employs spectral clustering guided by Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) to identify and remove redundant layers. Subsequently, the same strategy is applied to the channel dimension to eliminate a finer redundancy. To ensure robustness, we further employ a noise-robust fine-tuning strategy. Experiments on the UAV-M100 benchmark demonstrate that HSCP outperforms existing channel and layer pruning methods. Specifically, HSCP achieves $86.39\%$ parameter reduction and $84.44\%$ FLOPs reduction on ResNet18 while improving accuracy by $1.49\%$ compared to the unpruned baseline, and maintains superior robustness even in low signal-to-noise ratio environments.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across six diverse HAR benchmarks, recognizes and labels multiple unseen human activities, all without requiring model training or fine-tuning.

Conclusion: RAG-HAR offers a robust, practical framework for HAR that moves beyond known behaviors while eliminating the need for resource-intensive training, emphasizing its practical applicability.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) underpins applications in healthcare, rehabilitation, fitness tracking, and smart environments, yet existing deep learning approaches demand dataset-specific training, large labeled corpora, and significant computational resources.We introduce RAG-HAR, a training-free retrieval-augmented framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for HAR. RAG-HAR computes lightweight statistical descriptors, retrieves semantically similar samples from a vector database, and uses this contextual evidence to make LLM-based activity identification. We further enhance RAG-HAR by first applying prompt optimization and introducing an LLM-based activity descriptor that generates context-enriched vector databases for delivering accurate and highly relevant contextual information. Along with these mechanisms, RAG-HAR achieves state-of-the-art performance across six diverse HAR benchmarks. Most importantly, RAG-HAR attains these improvements without requiring model training or fine-tuning, emphasizing its robustness and practical applicability. RAG-HAR moves beyond known behaviors, enabling the recognition and meaningful labelling of multiple unseen human activities.

### [7] [An Efficient Test-Time Scaling Approach for Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08985)
*Vignesh Sundaresha,Akash Haridas,Vikram Appia,Lav Varshney*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Verifier-Threshold method for efficient test-time compute allocation in diffusion/flow image generation models, achieving 2-4x speedup over SOTA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for allocating non-uniform inference-compute budgets across denoising steps use greedy algorithms that allocate compute budget ineffectively, leading to inefficient image generation.

Method: Verifier-Threshold method that automatically reallocates test-time compute across different denoising steps in diffusion and flow models, improving computational efficiency.

Result: Achieves 2-4x reduction in computational time over state-of-the-art methods while maintaining the same performance on the GenEval benchmark.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses inefficient compute allocation in image generation models, delivering substantial efficiency improvements through better test-time compute management.

Abstract: Image generation has emerged as a mainstream application of large generative AI models. Just as test-time compute and reasoning have helped language models improve their capabilities, similar benefits have also been observed with image generation models. In particular, searching over noise samples for diffusion and flow models has shown to scale well with test-time compute. While recent works have explored allocating non-uniform inference-compute budgets across different denoising steps, they rely on greedy algorithms and allocate the compute budget ineffectively. In this work, we study this problem and propose solutions to fix it. We propose the Verifier-Threshold method which automatically reallocates test-time compute and delivers substantial efficiency improvements. For the same performance on the GenEval benchmark, we achieve a 2-4x reduction in computational time over the state-of-the-art method.

*Anca Mihai,Adrian Groza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed quality-control framework for diabetic retinopathy datasets using explainable feature filtering, image enhancement, deep-learning-assisted annotation, and annotator agreement validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation of diabetic retinopathy fundus images is prone to errors due to complex retinal structures and acquisition issues, requiring high-quality datasets for reliable AI model training.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) Explainable feature-based classifier filters inadequate images using image processing and contrastive learning features, 2) Image enhancement and deep-learning-assisted annotation, 3) Annotator agreement validation using derived formulas to determine annotation usability.

Result: Framework ensures only high-standard data is used for AI training and evaluation by systematically filtering poor-quality images and validating annotation reliability.

Conclusion: Proposed quality-control framework addresses data quality issues in diabetic retinopathy datasets, improving reliability of AI models for clinical diagnosis support.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) affects individuals with long-term diabetes. Without early diagnosis, DR can lead to vision loss. Fundus photography captures the structure of the retina along with abnormalities indicative of the stage of the disease. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can support clinicians in identifying these lesions, reducing manual workload, but models require high-quality annotated datasets. Due to the complexity of retinal structures, errors in image acquisition and lesion interpretation of manual annotators can occur. We proposed a quality-control framework, ensuring only high-standard data is used for evaluation and AI training. First, an explainable feature-based classifier is used to filter inadequate images. The features are extracted both using image processing and contrastive learning. Then, the images are enhanced and put subject to annotation, using deep-learning-based assistance. Lastly, the agreement between annotators calculated using derived formulas determines the usability of the annotations.

*Yuze Hao,Linchao Zhu,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DID framework enables true 3D inverse design from scratch using continuous latent representations and physics-aware optimization, outperforming existing methods that rely on 2D projections or shape fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current inverse design methods in 3D domains either use 2D projections or fine-tune existing shapes, sacrificing volumetric detail and constraining design exploration, preventing true 3D design from scratch.

Method: Learn unified physics-geometry embedding in continuous latent space, then use two-stage optimization: 1) gradient-guided diffusion sampler explores global latent manifold, 2) objective-driven topology-preserving refinement sculpts candidates toward target objectives.

Result: 3DID generates high-fidelity 3D geometries, outperforming existing methods in both solution quality and design versatility.

Conclusion: The proposed 3DID framework enables true 3D inverse design from scratch by directly navigating the 3D design space with continuous latent representations and physics-aware optimization.

Abstract: Inverse design aims to design the input variables of a physical system to optimize a specified objective function, typically formulated as a search or optimization problem. However, in 3D domains, the design space grows exponentially, rendering exhaustive grid-based searches infeasible. Recent advances in deep learning have accelerated inverse design by providing powerful generative priors and differentiable surrogate models. Nevertheless, current methods tend to approximate the 3D design space using 2D projections or fine-tune existing 3D shapes. These approaches sacrifice volumetric detail and constrain design exploration, preventing true 3D design from scratch. In this paper, we propose a 3D Inverse Design (3DID) framework that directly navigates the 3D design space by coupling a continuous latent representation with a physics-aware optimization strategy. We first learn a unified physics-geometry embedding that compactly captures shape and physical field data in a continuous latent space. Then, we introduce a two-stage strategy to perform physics-aware optimization. In the first stage, a gradient-guided diffusion sampler explores the global latent manifold. In the second stage, an objective-driven, topology-preserving refinement further sculpts each candidate toward the target objective. This enables 3DID to generate high-fidelity 3D geometries, outperforming existing methods in both solution quality and design versatility.

*Lu Huo,Wenjian Huang,Jianguo Zhang,Min Xu,Haimin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CKI framework enables effective HSI classification in fully heterogeneous settings by addressing spectral variations and semantic inconsistencies while incorporating target-private knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HSI classification methods are limited by assumptions of homogeneous domains or only co-occurring categories, and they fail to handle target-private information when label spaces don't overlap, restricting effective cross-domain knowledge transfer.

Method: Proposes Cross-scene Knowledge Integration (CKI) with three components: 1) Alignment of Spectral Characteristics (ASC) for domain-agnostic projection to reduce spectral discrepancies; 2) Cross-scene Knowledge Sharing Preference (CKSP) with Source Similarity Mechanism (SSM) to resolve semantic mismatch; 3) Complementary Information Integration (CII) to maximize use of target-specific complementary cues.

Result: Extensive experiments show CKI achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong stability across diverse cross-scene HSI scenarios.

Conclusion: CKI successfully overcomes limitations of existing methods by enabling knowledge transfer in fully heterogeneous settings through explicit incorporation of target-private knowledge during transfer.

Abstract: Knowledge transfer has strong potential to improve hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, yet two inherent challenges fundamentally restrict effective cross-domain transfer: spectral variations caused by different sensors and semantic inconsistencies across heterogeneous scenes. Existing methods are limited by transfer settings that assume homogeneous domains or heterogeneous scenarios with only co-occurring categories. When label spaces do not overlap, they further rely on complete source-domain coverage and therefore overlook critical target-private information. To overcome these limitations and enable knowledge transfer in fully heterogeneous settings, we propose Cross-scene Knowledge Integration (CKI), a framework that explicitly incorporates target-private knowledge during transfer. CKI includes: (1) Alignment of Spectral Characteristics (ASC) to reduce spectral discrepancies through domain-agnostic projection; (2) Cross-scene Knowledge Sharing Preference (CKSP), which resolves semantic mismatch via a Source Similarity Mechanism (SSM); and (3) Complementary Information Integration (CII) to maximize the use of target-specific complementary cues. Extensive experiments verify that CKI achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong stability across diverse cross-scene HSI scenarios.

*Yuang Geng,Zhuoyang Zhou,Zhongzheng Zhang,Siyuan Pan,Hoang-Dung Tran,Ivan Ruchkin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Deterministic World Model (DWM) for vision-based control verification, eliminating stochastic latent variables to reduce overapproximation error and improve verification precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Verifying closed-loop vision-based control systems is challenging due to image dimensionality and difficulty modeling visual environments. Generative models used as camera surrogates introduce unnecessary overapproximation error through stochastic latent variables.

Method: Develops Deterministic World Model (DWM) that maps system states directly to generative images, eliminating uninterpretable latent variables. Uses dual-objective loss combining pixel-level reconstruction accuracy with control difference loss. Integrates DWM with Star-based reachability analysis (StarV) and employs conformal prediction for statistical bounds on trajectory deviation.

Result: Experiments on standard benchmarks show significantly tighter reachable sets and better verification performance compared to latent-variable baseline approaches.

Conclusion: DWM addresses the bottleneck of stochastic latent variables in vision-based control verification, enabling more precise input bounds and improved verification performance through deterministic state-to-image mapping.

Abstract: Verifying closed-loop vision-based control systems remains a fundamental challenge due to the high dimensionality of images and the difficulty of modeling visual environments. While generative models are increasingly used as camera surrogates in verification, their reliance on stochastic latent variables introduces unnecessary overapproximation error. To address this bottleneck, we propose a Deterministic World Model (DWM) that maps system states directly to generative images, effectively eliminating uninterpretable latent variables to ensure precise input bounds. The DWM is trained with a dual-objective loss function that combines pixel-level reconstruction accuracy with a control difference loss to maintain behavioral consistency with the real system. We integrate DWM into a verification pipeline utilizing Star-based reachability analysis (StarV) and employ conformal prediction to derive rigorous statistical bounds on the trajectory deviation between the world model and the actual vision-based system. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our approach yields significantly tighter reachable sets and better verification performance than a latent-variable baseline.

TL;DR: Novel generative model predicts 3D radiotherapy dose distributions using customizable user preferences instead of reference plans, reducing institutional bias and enabling personalized planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning approaches for 3D dose prediction rely on reference plans as ground truth, which biases models toward specific institutional planning styles and preferences, limiting flexibility and personalization.

Method: Introduces a generative model that predicts 3D dose distributions based solely on user-defined preference flavors, allowing planners to customize trade-offs between organs-at-risk (OARs) and planning target volumes (PTVs) for personalized planning.

Result: The method demonstrates superior adaptability and plan quality compared to Varian RapidPlan model in some scenarios, while enabling seamless integration with clinical treatment planning systems for efficient high-quality plan generation.

Conclusion: The approach offers a flexible, personalized alternative to reference-based dose prediction models by allowing user-defined preferences, reducing institutional bias, and improving clinical planning efficiency.

Abstract: Radiotherapy planning is a highly complex process that often varies significantly across institutions and individual planners. Most existing deep learning approaches for 3D dose prediction rely on reference plans as ground truth during training, which can inadvertently bias models toward specific planning styles or institutional preferences. In this study, we introduce a novel generative model that predicts 3D dose distributions based solely on user-defined preference flavors. These customizable preferences enable planners to prioritize specific trade-offs between organs-at-risk (OARs) and planning target volumes (PTVs), offering greater flexibility and personalization. Designed for seamless integration with clinical treatment planning systems, our approach assists users in generating high-quality plans efficiently. Comparative evaluations demonstrate that our method can surpasses the Varian RapidPlan model in both adaptability and plan quality in some scenarios.

### [13] [Diffusion Model Regularized Implicit Neural Representation for CT Metal Artifact Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08999)
*Jie Wen,Chenhe Du,Xiao Wang,Yuyao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes diffusion model regularized implicit neural representation for metal artifact reduction in CT, combining physical constraints with learned priors for better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing supervised MAR methods rely on limited paired metal-clean data, causing performance instability. Unsupervised methods fail to incorporate CT physical geometry effectively and can't fully capture available prior knowledge with traditional regularization.

Method: Combines implicit neural representation (integrates physical constraints and data fidelity) with pre-trained diffusion model (provides prior knowledge regularization).

Result: Experimental results on simulated and clinical data demonstrate effectiveness and generalization ability, showing potential for clinical application.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of existing MAR methods by combining physical modeling with learned priors, offering promising clinical applicability.

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) images are often severely corrupted by artifacts in the presence of metals. Existing supervised metal artifact reduction (MAR) approaches suffer from performance instability on known data due to their reliance on limited paired metal-clean data, which limits their clinical applicability. Moreover, existing unsupervised methods face two main challenges: 1) the CT physical geometry is not effectively incorporated into the MAR process to ensure data fidelity; 2) traditional heuristics regularization terms cannot fully capture the abundant prior knowledge available. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose diffusion model regularized implicit neural representation framework for MAR. The implicit neural representation integrates physical constraints and imposes data fidelity, while the pre-trained diffusion model provides prior knowledge to regularize the solution. Experimental results on both simulated and clinical data demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our method, highlighting its potential to be applied to clinical settings.

*Yuehua Hu,Jiyeong Kong,Dong-yeol Shin,Jaekyun Kim,Kyung-Tae Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel method generates large-scale, physically valid lithography defect datasets with pixel-level annotations for AI training, achieving ~34-42% AP improvement over baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI in micro/nano manufacturing is limited by scarce, inaccessible high-quality defect data from semiconductor industry, creating a bottleneck for defect inspection research.

Method: Physics-constrained mathematical morphology operations synthesize defect layouts, DMD-based lithography fabricates physical samples, optical micrographs are compared to create pixel-accurate segmentation annotations.

Result: Created dataset of 3,530 optical micrographs with 13,365 annotated defects across 4 classes; Mask R-CNN achieved AP@0.5 of 0.980-0.971 vs 0.740-0.717 for Faster R-CNN (~34-42% improvement).

Conclusion: The methodology successfully generates high-quality defect datasets with pixel-level annotations, enabling robust AI-based measurement/inspection in semiconductor fabrication.

Abstract: The efficacy of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in micro/nano manufacturing is fundamentally constrained by the scarcity of high-quality and physically grounded training data for defect inspection. Lithography defect data from semiconductor industry are rarely accessible for research use, resulting in a shortage of publicly available datasets. To address this bottleneck in lithography, this study proposes a novel methodology for generating large-scale, physically valid defect datasets with pixel-level annotations. The framework begins with the ab initio synthesis of defect layouts using controllable, physics-constrained mathematical morphology operations (erosion and dilation) applied to the original design-level layout. These synthesized layouts, together with their defect-free counterparts, are fabricated into physical samples via high-fidelity digital micromirror device (DMD)-based lithography. Optical micrographs of the synthesized defect samples and their defect-free references are then compared to create consistent defect delineation annotations. Using this methodology, we constructed a comprehensive dataset of 3,530 Optical micrographs containing 13,365 annotated defect instances including four classes: bridge, burr, pinch, and contamination. Each defect instance is annotated with a pixel-accurate segmentation mask, preserving full contour and geometry. The segmentation-based Mask R-CNN achieves AP@0.5 of 0.980, 0.965, and 0.971, compared with 0.740, 0.719, and 0.717 for Faster R-CNN on bridge, burr, and pinch classes, representing a mean AP@0.5 improvement of approximately 34%. For the contamination class, Mask R-CNN achieves an AP@0.5 roughly 42% higher than Faster R-CNN. These consistent gains demonstrate that our proposed methodology to generate defect datasets with pixel-level annotations is feasible for robust AI-based Measurement/Inspection (MI) in semiconductor fabrication.

Conclusion: Identifies future directions to enhance realism, coherence, and expressiveness of avatars in dyadic settings, with resources available online.

Abstract: Body and face motion play an integral role in communication. They convey crucial information on the participants. Advances in generative modeling and multi-modal learning have enabled motion generation from signals such as speech, conversational context and visual cues. However, generating expressive and coherent face and body dynamics remains challenging due to the complex interplay of verbal / non-verbal cues and individual personality traits. This survey reviews body and face motion generation, covering core concepts, representations techniques, generative approaches, datasets and evaluation metrics. We highlight future directions to enhance the realism, coherence and expressiveness of avatars in dyadic settings. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first comprehensive review to cover both body and face motion. Detailed resources are listed on https://lownish23csz0010.github.io/mogen/.

### [16] [Towards Lossless Ultimate Vision Token Compression for VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09010)
*Dehua Zheng,Mouxiao Huang,Borui Jiang,Hailin Hu,Xinghao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LUVC is a training-free framework that compresses visual tokens in VLMs using iterative merging in the visual encoder and attention-free pruning in LLM layers, achieving 2× speedup with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual language models suffer from computational inefficiency due to redundant token representations in high-resolution images/videos. Current compression methods have position bias, class imbalance, and poor generalization to shallow LLM layers with weak cross-modal interactions.

Method: Two-pronged approach: 1) Extends token compression to visual encoder via iterative merging orthogonal in spatial axes; 2) Integrates spectrum pruning unit into LLM using attention-free low-pass filter that gradually prunes redundant visual tokens, compatible with FlashAttention. Forms Lossless Ultimate Vision tokens Compression (LUVC) framework.

Result: Achieves 2× speedup inference in language model with negligible accuracy degradation. Training-free characteristic enables immediate deployment across multiple VLMs.

Conclusion: LUVC systematically compresses visual tokens until complete elimination at final LLM layer, gradually fusing high-dimensional visual features into multimodal queries, addressing efficiency challenges in VLMs while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: Visual language models encounter challenges in computational efficiency and latency, primarily due to the substantial redundancy in the token representations of high-resolution images and videos. Current attention/similarity-based compression algorithms suffer from either position bias or class imbalance, leading to significant accuracy degradation. They also fail to generalize to shallow LLM layers, which exhibit weaker cross-modal interactions. To address this, we extend token compression to the visual encoder through an effective iterative merging scheme that is orthogonal in spatial axes to accelerate the computation across the entire VLM. Furthermoer, we integrate a spectrum pruning unit into LLM through an attention/similarity-free low-pass filter, which gradually prunes redundant visual tokens and is fully compatible to modern FlashAttention. On this basis, we propose Lossless Ultimate Vision tokens Compression (LUVC) framework. LUVC systematically compresses visual tokens until complete elimination at the final layer of LLM, so that the high-dimensional visual features are gradually fused into the multimodal queries. The experiments show that LUVC achieves a 2 speedup inference in language model with negligible accuracy degradation, and the training-free characteristic enables immediate deployment across multiple VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning approach for detecting specific characters/individuals in video sequences using supervised learning algorithms, with applications in security systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient method for searching and detecting specific entities (characters/individuals) in video sequences, with practical applications in security systems, particularly for Angola's national security using CISP video databases.

Method: Uses deep learning techniques with artificial neural networks and supervised learning algorithms that leverage simple characteristics of target characters to detect them in video sequences.

Result: The approach successfully locates wanted individuals efficiently from both private and public image databases, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in computer vision character detection.

Conclusion: The proposed classifier enables reinforcement of Angola's national security system by detecting target individuals (disappeared persons, criminals) from CISP video sequences, demonstrating practical real-world applications of deep learning for video analysis.

Abstract: The notion of learning underlies almost every evolution of Intelligent Agents. In this paper, we present an approach for searching and detecting a given entity in a video sequence. Specifically, we study how the deep learning technique by artificial neuralnetworks allows us to detect a character in a video sequence. The technique of detecting a character in a video is a complex field of study, considering the multitude of objects present in the data under analysis. From the results obtained, we highlight the following, compared to state of the art: In our approach, within the field of Computer Vision, the structuring of supervised learning algorithms allowed us to achieve several successes from simple characteristics of the target character. Our results demonstrate that is new approach allows us to locate, in an efficient way, wanted individuals from a private or public image base. For the case of Angola, the classifier we propose opens the possibility of reinforcing the national security system based on the database of target individuals (disappeared, criminals, etc.) and the video sequences of the Integrated Public Security Centre (CISP).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras offer high temporal resolution and dynamic range but remain susceptible to lens flare, which creates complex spatio-temporal distortions that have been largely overlooked in event stream processing.

Method: The authors first derive a physics-grounded forward model of the non-linear suppression mechanism, then create the E-Deflare Benchmark with simulated training set (E-Flare-2.7K) and paired real-world test set (E-Flare-R). They design E-DeflareNet, a neural network for flare removal.

Conclusion: The paper presents the first systematic framework for lens flare removal in event cameras, providing theoretical foundations, comprehensive datasets, and an effective neural network solution that advances event-based vision systems.

Abstract: Event cameras have the potential to revolutionize vision systems with their high temporal resolution and dynamic range, yet they remain susceptible to lens flare, a fundamental optical artifact that causes severe degradation. In event streams, this optical artifact forms a complex, spatio-temporal distortion that has been largely overlooked. We present E-Deflare, the first systematic framework for removing lens flare from event camera data. We first establish the theoretical foundation by deriving a physics-grounded forward model of the non-linear suppression mechanism. This insight enables the creation of the E-Deflare Benchmark, a comprehensive resource featuring a large-scale simulated training set, E-Flare-2.7K, and the first-ever paired real-world test set, E-Flare-R, captured by our novel optical system. Empowered by this benchmark, we design E-DeflareNet, which achieves state-of-the-art restoration performance. Extensive experiments validate our approach and demonstrate clear benefits for downstream tasks. Code and datasets are publicly available.

TL;DR: ConceptPose: Training-free, model-free object pose estimation using vision-language models to create 3D concept maps with saliency-based concept vectors, achieving SOTA zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most object pose estimation methods require extensive dataset-specific training, while vision-language models show strong zero-shot capabilities. The goal is to bridge these worlds for training-free pose estimation.

Method: Leverages vision-language models to create open-vocabulary 3D concept maps where each point is tagged with concept vectors from saliency maps. Uses robust 3D-3D correspondences across concept maps for precise 6DoF relative pose estimation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on zero-shot relative pose estimation benchmarks, outperforming existing methods by over 62% in ADD(-S) score, including methods with extensive dataset-specific training.

Conclusion: ConceptPose demonstrates that training-free, model-free object pose estimation is possible by leveraging vision-language models' zero-shot capabilities, significantly advancing the field without requiring object-specific training.

Abstract: Object pose estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision and robotics, yet most methods require extensive, dataset-specific training. Concurrently, large-scale vision language models show remarkable zero-shot capabilities. In this work, we bridge these two worlds by introducing ConceptPose, a framework for object pose estimation that is both training-free and model-free. ConceptPose leverages a vision-language-model (VLM) to create open-vocabulary 3D concept maps, where each point is tagged with a concept vector derived from saliency maps. By establishing robust 3D-3D correspondences across concept maps, our approach allows precise estimation of 6DoF relative pose. Without any object or dataset-specific training, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on common zero shot relative pose estimation benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing methods by over 62% in ADD(-S) score, including those that utilize extensive dataset-specific training.

### [20] [SIP: Site in Pieces- A Dataset of Disaggregated Construction-Phase 3D Scans for Semantic Segmentation and Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09062)
*Seongyong Kim,Yong Kwon Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIP (Site in Pieces) is a 3D LiDAR dataset for construction sites that captures real-world sensing challenges like radial density decay, fragmented geometry, and view-dependent visibility, with point-level annotations using a construction-specific taxonomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D perception datasets don't reflect real construction site conditions - they use dense fused scans with uniform sampling, while actual field data has single-station LiDAR views with radial density decay, fragmented geometry, and view-dependent visibility due to safety constraints and ongoing operations.

Method: Created SIP dataset using terrestrial LiDAR scanner with indoor/outdoor construction scenes, annotated at point level using construction-specific taxonomy (Built Environment, Construction Operations, Site Surroundings). Includes scanning protocol, annotation workflow, and quality control procedures.

Result: SIP dataset captures real-world sensing characteristics including structural components and slender temporary objects (scaffolding, MEP piping, scissor lifts) where sparsity from occlusion and fragmented geometry makes segmentation challenging. Dataset is openly available with Git repository and adaptable class configurations.

Conclusion: SIP provides field data that retains real-world sensing characteristics, enabling robust benchmarking and advancing construction-oriented 3D vision tasks by addressing the gap between ideal lab conditions and practical construction site constraints.

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene interpretation in active construction sites is essential for progress monitoring, safety assessment, and digital twin development. LiDAR is widely used in construction because it offers advantages over camera-based systems, performing reliably in cluttered and dynamically changing conditions. Yet most public datasets for 3D perception are derived from densely fused scans with uniform sampling and complete visibility, conditions that do not reflect real construction sites. Field data are often collected as isolated single-station LiDAR views, constrained by safety requirements, limited access, and ongoing operations. These factors lead to radial density decay, fragmented geometry, and view-dependent visibility-characteristics that remain underrepresented in existing datasets. This paper presents SIP, Site in Pieces, a dataset created to reflect the practical constraints of LiDAR acquisition during construction. SIP provides indoor and outdoor scenes captured with a terrestrial LiDAR scanner and annotated at the point level using a taxonomy tailored to construction environments: A. Built Environment, B. Construction Operations, and C. Site Surroundings. The dataset includes both structural components and slender temporary objects such as scaffolding, MEP piping, and scissor lifts, where sparsity caused by occlusion and fragmented geometry make segmentation particularly challenging. The scanning protocol, annotation workflow, and quality control procedures establish a consistent foundation for the dataset. SIP is openly available with a supporting Git repository, offering adaptable class configurations that streamline adoption within modern 3D deep learning frameworks. By providing field data that retain real-world sensing characteristics, SIP enables robust benchmarking and contributes to advancing construction-oriented 3D vision tasks.

*Erfan Nourbakhsh,Nasrin Sanjari,Ali Nourbakhsh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KD-OCT uses knowledge distillation to compress a large ConvNeXtV2-Large teacher model into a lightweight EfficientNet-B2 student for efficient AMD/CNV classification from OCT images, achieving near-teacher performance with much lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for AMD/CNV detection from OCT images are computationally intensive, making clinical deployment challenging. There's a need for efficient models that maintain high diagnostic performance while enabling real-time clinical use.

Method: Proposed KD-OCT framework uses knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge from a high-performance ConvNeXtV2-Large teacher (enhanced with advanced augmentations, stochastic weight averaging, and focal loss) to a lightweight EfficientNet-B2 student. Uses real-time distillation with combined loss balancing soft teacher knowledge and hard ground-truth supervision.

Result: KD-OCT outperforms comparable multi-scale or feature-fusion OCT classifiers in efficiency-accuracy balance, achieving near-teacher performance with substantial reductions in model size and inference time. Student model exceeds most existing frameworks while enabling edge deployment.

Conclusion: KD-OCT successfully compresses a high-performance OCT classifier into a lightweight model suitable for clinical edge deployment, facilitating AMD screening with efficient real-time performance while maintaining diagnostic accuracy.

Abstract: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and choroidal neovascularization (CNV)-related conditions are leading causes of vision loss worldwide, with optical coherence tomography (OCT) serving as a cornerstone for early detection and management. However, deploying state-of-the-art deep learning models like ConvNeXtV2-Large in clinical settings is hindered by their computational demands. Therefore, it is desirable to develop efficient models that maintain high diagnostic performance while enabling real-time deployment. In this study, a novel knowledge distillation framework, termed KD-OCT, is proposed to compress a high-performance ConvNeXtV2-Large teacher model, enhanced with advanced augmentations, stochastic weight averaging, and focal loss, into a lightweight EfficientNet-B2 student for classifying normal, drusen, and CNV cases. KD-OCT employs real-time distillation with a combined loss balancing soft teacher knowledge transfer and hard ground-truth supervision. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on the Noor Eye Hospital (NEH) dataset using patient-level cross-validation. Experimental results demonstrate that KD-OCT outperforms comparable multi-scale or feature-fusion OCT classifiers in efficiency- accuracy balance, achieving near-teacher performance with substantial reductions in model size and inference time. Despite the compression, the student model exceeds most existing frameworks, facilitating edge deployment for AMD screening. Code is available at https://github.com/erfan-nourbakhsh/KD- OCT.

### [22] [Adaptive Thresholding for Visual Place Recognition using Negative Gaussian Mixture Statistics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09071)
*Nick Trinh,Damian Lyons*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes automatic threshold selection for visual place recognition using negative Gaussian mixture statistics to overcome manual threshold limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual threshold selection for VPR matching is difficult and doesn't generalize across diverse visual scenarios (seasonal changes, illumination, structural changes, traffic). Current metrics like recall@K and ROC curves don't address practical implementation needs.

Method: Uses 'negative' Gaussian mixture statistics - image statistics indicating "not this place" - to automatically select thresholds that work across different image databases and descriptors.

Result: The approach can select thresholds that work well for a variety of image databases and image descriptors, overcoming manual threshold limitations.

Conclusion: Automatic threshold selection using negative place statistics provides a practical solution for robust VPR implementation across diverse visual scenarios.

Abstract: Visual place recognition (VPR) is an important component technology for camera-based mapping and navigation applications. This is a challenging problem because images of the same place may appear quite different for reasons including seasonal changes, weather illumination, structural changes to the environment, as well as transient pedestrian or vehicle traffic. Papers focusing on generating image descriptors for VPR report their results using metrics such as recall@K and ROC curves. However, for a robot implementation, determining which matches are sufficiently good is often reduced to a manually set threshold. And it is difficult to manually select a threshold that will work for a variety of visual scenarios. This paper addresses the problem of automatically selecting a threshold for VPR by looking at the 'negative' Gaussian mixture statistics for a place - image statistics indicating not this place. We show that this approach can be used to select thresholds that work well for a variety of image databases and image descriptors.

*Arman Zarei,Jiacheng Pan,Matthew Gwilliam,Soheil Feizi,Zhenheng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AgentComp trains text-to-image models to better differentiate compositional variations using LLM agents to create datasets and preference optimization, achieving SOTA on compositionality benchmarks without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models struggle with compositionality - accurately capturing object relationships, attribute bindings, and fine-grained details. They lack explicit training to differentiate between compositionally similar prompts, leading to outputs that deviate in subtle details.

Method: AgentComp leverages LLMs with image generation, editing, and VQA tools to autonomously construct compositional datasets, then applies agentic preference optimization to fine-tune text-to-image models to better distinguish between compositionally similar samples.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on compositionality benchmarks like T2I-CompBench without compromising image quality, and even generalizes to other capabilities like text rendering not explicitly trained for.

Conclusion: AgentComp effectively addresses compositionality limitations in text-to-image generation by using LLM agents for dataset creation and preference optimization, resulting in improved compositional reasoning while maintaining image quality.

Abstract: Text-to-image generative models have achieved remarkable visual quality but still struggle with compositionality$-$accurately capturing object relationships, attribute bindings, and fine-grained details in prompts. A key limitation is that models are not explicitly trained to differentiate between compositionally similar prompts and images, resulting in outputs that are close to the intended description yet deviate in fine-grained details. To address this, we propose AgentComp, a framework that explicitly trains models to better differentiate such compositional variations and enhance their reasoning ability. AgentComp leverages the reasoning and tool-use capabilities of large language models equipped with image generation, editing, and VQA tools to autonomously construct compositional datasets. Using these datasets, we apply an agentic preference optimization method to fine-tune text-to-image models, enabling them to better distinguish between compositionally similar samples and resulting in overall stronger compositional generation ability. AgentComp achieves state-of-the-art results on compositionality benchmarks such as T2I-CompBench, without compromising image quality$-$a common drawback in prior approaches$-$and even generalizes to other capabilities not explicitly trained for, such as text rendering.

TL;DR: MDSE is a vision-language framework that generates detailed textual explanations of post-disaster underground mining scenes to improve situational awareness in obscured environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underground mining disasters create darkness, dust, and collapses that obscure vision, making situational awareness difficult for humans and conventional systems, necessitating automated scene understanding solutions.

Method: MDSE features three innovations: Context-Aware Cross-Attention for robust visual-text alignment under degradation, Segmentation-aware dual pathway visual encoding fusing global and region-specific embeddings, and Resource-Efficient Transformer-Based Language Model for expressive caption generation with minimal compute cost.

Result: MDSE substantially outperforms state-of-the-art captioning models on the Underground Mine Disaster (UMD) dataset and related benchmarks, producing more accurate and contextually relevant descriptions that capture crucial details in obscured environments.

Conclusion: MDSE effectively improves situational awareness for underground emergency response by generating detailed textual explanations of post-disaster scenes, with code publicly available for further development and application.

Abstract: Underground mining disasters produce pervasive darkness, dust, and collapses that obscure vision and make situational awareness difficult for humans and conventional systems. To address this, we propose MDSE, Multimodal Disaster Situation Explainer, a novel vision-language framework that automatically generates detailed textual explanations of post-disaster underground scenes. MDSE has three-fold innovations: (i) Context-Aware Cross-Attention for robust alignment of visual and textual features even under severe degradation; (ii) Segmentation-aware dual pathway visual encoding that fuses global and region-specific embeddings; and (iii) Resource-Efficient Transformer-Based Language Model for expressive caption generation with minimal compute cost. To support this task, we present the Underground Mine Disaster (UMD) dataset--the first image-caption corpus of real underground disaster scenes--enabling rigorous training and evaluation. Extensive experiments on UMD and related benchmarks show that MDSE substantially outperforms state-of-the-art captioning models, producing more accurate and contextually relevant descriptions that capture crucial details in obscured environments, improving situational awareness for underground emergency response.

### [25] [Food Image Generation on Multi-Noun Categories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09095)
*Xinyue Pan,Yuhao Chen,Jiangpeng He,Fengqing Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoCULR improves food image generation for multi-noun categories by incorporating domain knowledge and refining spatial layouts to prevent misinterpretation of compound names.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models struggle with multi-noun food categories (like "egg noodle"), often producing images with separate ingredients instead of the intended compound dish, due to insufficient domain knowledge and misinterpretation of noun relationships in text encoders.

Method: Proposes FoCULR (Food Category Understanding and Layout Refinement) which incorporates food domain knowledge and introduces core concepts early in the generation process to better understand multi-noun relationships and refine spatial layouts.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate improved image generation performance for food categories, particularly for challenging multi-noun cases that previously caused misinterpretations.

Conclusion: Incorporating domain-specific knowledge and refining layout understanding is crucial for accurate generation of multi-noun food categories, addressing a significant challenge in food image synthesis.

Abstract: Generating realistic food images for categories with multiple nouns is surprisingly challenging. For instance, the prompt "egg noodle" may result in images that incorrectly contain both eggs and noodles as separate entities. Multi-noun food categories are common in real-world datasets and account for a large portion of entries in benchmarks such as UEC-256. These compound names often cause generative models to misinterpret the semantics, producing unintended ingredients or objects. This is due to insufficient multi-noun category related knowledge in the text encoder and misinterpretation of multi-noun relationships, leading to incorrect spatial layouts. To overcome these challenges, we propose FoCULR (Food Category Understanding and Layout Refinement) which incorporates food domain knowledge and introduces core concepts early in the generation process. Experimental results demonstrate that the integration of these techniques improves image generation performance in the food domain.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GimbalDiffusion enables precise camera control in text-to-video generation using physical-world coordinates and gravity as reference, allowing absolute camera trajectory specification without initial reference frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-video generation lacks fine-grained control over camera motion and orientation, with current approaches using relative or ambiguous representations that limit explicit geometric control.

Method: Uses absolute coordinate system with gravity as global reference, leverages panoramic 360-degree videos for diverse camera trajectories, introduces null-pitch conditioning to reduce text-camera conflicts, and establishes rebalanced benchmark for evaluation.

Result: Enables precise and interpretable camera parameter control, generates diverse camera trajectories beyond conventional forward-facing motions, and improves robustness when camera specifications conflict with text content.

Conclusion: GimbalDiffusion advances text-to-video controllability by enabling gravity-aligned camera manipulation with physical-world coordinate grounding, moving beyond relative representations to absolute geometric control.

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-video generation has achieved remarkable realism, yet fine-grained control over camera motion and orientation remains elusive. Existing approaches typically encode camera trajectories through relative or ambiguous representations, limiting explicit geometric control. We introduce GimbalDiffusion, a framework that enables camera control grounded in physical-world coordinates, using gravity as a global reference. Instead of describing motion relative to previous frames, our method defines camera trajectories in an absolute coordinate system, allowing precise and interpretable control over camera parameters without requiring an initial reference frame. We leverage panoramic 360-degree videos to construct a wide variety of camera trajectories, well beyond the predominantly straight, forward-facing trajectories seen in conventional video data. To further enhance camera guidance, we introduce null-pitch conditioning, an annotation strategy that reduces the model's reliance on text content when conflicting with camera specifications (e.g., generating grass while the camera points towards the sky). Finally, we establish a benchmark for camera-aware video generation by rebalancing SpatialVID-HQ for comprehensive evaluation under wide camera pitch variation. Together, these contributions advance the controllability and robustness of text-to-video models, enabling precise, gravity-aligned camera manipulation within generative frameworks.

*Sander Riisøen Jyhne,Christian Igel,Morten Goodwin,Per-Arne Andersen,Serge Belongie,Nico Lang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SuperF is a test-time optimization approach for multi-image super-resolution that uses neural fields to represent continuous signals, jointly optimizing frame alignment and super-resolution without high-resolution training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution imagery faces sensor limitations, atmospheric conditions, and costs. Single-image super-resolution often creates hallucinated structures, while multi-image super-resolution (MISR) can improve resolution using multiple sub-pixel shifted views but needs better methods.

Method: Proposes SuperF using coordinate-based neural networks (neural fields) to share an implicit neural representation across multiple low-resolution frames. Jointly optimizes frame alignment via affine transformation parameters and uses super-sampled coordinate grids for output resolution.

Result: Compelling results on simulated bursts of satellite imagery and ground-level images from handheld cameras with upsampling factors up to 8×. Outperforms related INR baselines from burst fusion approaches.

Conclusion: SuperF provides an effective test-time optimization approach for MISR that avoids hallucinated structures, doesn't require high-resolution training data, and successfully handles both satellite and handheld camera imagery.

Abstract: High-resolution imagery is often hindered by limitations in sensor technology, atmospheric conditions, and costs. Such challenges occur in satellite remote sensing, but also with handheld cameras, such as our smartphones. Hence, super-resolution aims to enhance the image resolution algorithmically. Since single-image super-resolution requires solving an inverse problem, such methods must exploit strong priors, e.g. learned from high-resolution training data, or be constrained by auxiliary data, e.g. by a high-resolution guide from another modality. While qualitatively pleasing, such approaches often lead to "hallucinated" structures that do not match reality. In contrast, multi-image super-resolution (MISR) aims to improve the (optical) resolution by constraining the super-resolution process with multiple views taken with sub-pixel shifts. Here, we propose SuperF, a test-time optimization approach for MISR that leverages coordinate-based neural networks, also called neural fields. Their ability to represent continuous signals with an implicit neural representation (INR) makes them an ideal fit for the MISR task.
  The key characteristic of our approach is to share an INR for multiple shifted low-resolution frames and to jointly optimize the frame alignment with the INR. Our approach advances related INR baselines, adopted from burst fusion for layer separation, by directly parameterizing the sub-pixel alignment as optimizable affine transformation parameters and by optimizing via a super-sampled coordinate grid that corresponds to the output resolution. Our experiments yield compelling results on simulated bursts of satellite imagery and ground-level images from handheld cameras, with upsampling factors of up to 8. A key advantage of SuperF is that this approach does not rely on any high-resolution training data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AngioAI-QFR is an end-to-end angiography pipeline combining deep learning stenosis detection, lumen segmentation, and automated QFR computation with virtual PCI planning, achieving strong correlation with invasive FFR and near real-time results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current angiography-derived indices like QFR are workflow intensive and separate from automated anatomy analysis and virtual PCI planning. There's a need for a unified, automated system that combines computer vision, functional profiling, and virtual PCI planning.

Method: Developed AngioAI-QFR, an end-to-end angiography-only pipeline combining deep learning stenosis detection, lumen segmentation, centreline and diameter extraction, per-millimetre Relative Flow Capacity profiling, and virtual stenting with automatic recomputation of angiography-derived QFR.

Result: Strong correlation with invasive FFR (r = 0.89, MAE 0.045), excellent diagnostic performance (AUC 0.93, sensitivity 0.88, specificity 0.86), fully automatic completion in 93% of vessels with median time 41 seconds. RFC profiling distinguished focal from diffuse disease, and virtual stenting predicted larger QFR gain in focal disease.

Conclusion: AngioAI-QFR provides a practical, near real-time pipeline that unifies computer vision, functional profiling, and virtual PCI with automated angiography-derived physiology, offering a comprehensive solution for coronary artery assessment.

Abstract: Coronary angiography is the main tool for assessing coronary artery disease, but visual grading of stenosis is variable and only moderately related to ischaemia. Wire based fractional flow reserve (FFR) improves lesion selection but is not used systematically. Angiography derived indices such as quantitative flow ratio (QFR) offer wire free physiology, yet many tools are workflow intensive and separate from automated anatomy analysis and virtual PCI planning. We developed AngioAI-QFR, an end to end angiography only pipeline combining deep learning stenosis detection, lumen segmentation, centreline and diameter extraction, per millimetre Relative Flow Capacity profiling, and virtual stenting with automatic recomputation of angiography derived QFR. The system was evaluated in 100 consecutive vessels with invasive FFR as reference. Primary endpoints were agreement with FFR (correlation, mean absolute error) and diagnostic performance for FFR <= 0.80. On held out frames, stenosis detection achieved precision 0.97 and lumen segmentation Dice 0.78. Across 100 vessels, AngioAI-QFR correlated strongly with FFR (r = 0.89, MAE 0.045). The AUC for detecting FFR <= 0.80 was 0.93, with sensitivity 0.88 and specificity 0.86. The pipeline completed fully automatically in 93 percent of vessels, with median time to result 41 s. RFC profiling distinguished focal from diffuse capacity loss, and virtual stenting predicted larger QFR gain in focal than in diffuse disease. AngioAI-QFR provides a practical, near real time pipeline that unifies computer vision, functional profiling, and virtual PCI with automated angiography derived physiology.

Method: Embed canonical Gaussian primitives' local frames into UV space patches on a template mesh, reconstruct continuous editable material textures from monocular video, and use physically based reflectance model for relighting.

Result: Accurate reconstructions, high-quality relighting results, and intuitive controls for modifying avatar appearance/geometry via texture mapping without additional optimization.

Conclusion: Successfully bridges the gap between Gaussian Splatting's photorealism and traditional mesh-based editability through UV texture mapping integration.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Gaussian Splatting have enabled increasingly accurate reconstruction of photorealistic head avatars, opening the door to numerous applications in visual effects, videoconferencing, and virtual reality. This, however, comes with the lack of intuitive editability offered by traditional triangle mesh-based methods. In contrast, we propose a method that combines the accuracy and fidelity of 2D Gaussian Splatting with the intuitiveness of UV texture mapping. By embedding each canonical Gaussian primitive's local frame into a patch in the UV space of a template mesh in a computationally efficient manner, we reconstruct continuous editable material head textures from a single monocular video on a conventional UV domain. Furthermore, we leverage an efficient physically based reflectance model to enable relighting and editing of these intrinsic material maps. Through extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, we demonstrate the accuracy of our reconstructions, the quality of our relighting results, and the ability to provide intuitive controls for modifying an avatar's appearance and geometry via texture mapping without additional optimization.

*Jin Cao,Hong-Xing Yu,Jiajun Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WonderZoom generates multi-scale 3D scenes from a single image using scale-adaptive Gaussian surfels and progressive detail synthesis, enabling zooming into regions to create fine details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D world generation models are limited to single-scale synthesis and cannot produce coherent scene contents at varying granularities, lacking scale-aware 3D representations.

Method: Two key innovations: (1) scale-adaptive Gaussian surfels for multi-scale 3D scene generation and real-time rendering, and (2) a progressive detail synthesizer that iteratively generates finer-scale 3D contents.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art video and 3D models in both quality and alignment, enabling multi-scale 3D world creation from a single image with interactive zooming capabilities.

Conclusion: WonderZoom enables users to "zoom into" 3D regions and auto-regressively synthesize previously non-existent fine details, creating comprehensive multi-scale 3D worlds from single images.

Abstract: We present WonderZoom, a novel approach to generating 3D scenes with contents across multiple spatial scales from a single image. Existing 3D world generation models remain limited to single-scale synthesis and cannot produce coherent scene contents at varying granularities. The fundamental challenge is the lack of a scale-aware 3D representation capable of generating and rendering content with largely different spatial sizes. WonderZoom addresses this through two key innovations: (1) scale-adaptive Gaussian surfels for generating and real-time rendering of multi-scale 3D scenes, and (2) a progressive detail synthesizer that iteratively generates finer-scale 3D contents. Our approach enables users to "zoom into" a 3D region and auto-regressively synthesize previously non-existent fine details from landscapes to microscopic features. Experiments demonstrate that WonderZoom significantly outperforms state-of-the-art video and 3D models in both quality and alignment, enabling multi-scale 3D world creation from a single image. We show video results and an interactive viewer of generated multi-scale 3D worlds in https://wonderzoom.github.io/

*Sauda Maryam,Sara Nadeem,Faisal Qureshi,Mohsen Ali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First Prompt-based Continual Compositional Zero-Shot Learning framework that adapts vision-language models to new attributes/objects while preventing forgetting, using multi-teacher distillation and specialized prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual adaptation of vision-language models to new attributes, objects, and compositions in CZSL is challenging because attributes/objects can reoccur across sessions while compositions remain unique, requiring prevention of catastrophic forgetting while maintaining compositional generalization.

Method: PromptCCZSL framework built on frozen VLM backbone with recency-weighted multi-teacher distillation, session-aware compositional prompts, session-agnostic attribute/object prompts, Cosine Anchor Loss for stability, Orthogonal Projection Loss for distinct embeddings, and Intra-Session Diversity Loss for richer representations.

Result: Substantial improvements over prior VLM-based and non-VLM baselines on UT-Zappos and C-GQA benchmarks, setting new benchmark for CCZSL in closed-world settings.

Conclusion: Proposed PromptCCZSL effectively addresses continual compositional zero-shot learning by balancing adaptation to new compositions with preservation of prior knowledge, introducing comprehensive evaluation protocol and achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: We tackle continual adaptation of vision-language models to new attributes, objects, and their compositions in Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL), while preventing forgetting of prior knowledge. Unlike classical continual learning where classes are disjoint, CCZSL is more complex as attributes and objects may reoccur across sessions while compositions remain unique. Built on a frozen VLM backbone, we propose the first Prompt-based Continual Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (PromptCCZSL) framework that retains prior knowledge through recency-weighted multi-teacher distillation. It employs session-aware compositional prompts to fuse multimodal features for new compositions, while attribute and object prompts are learned through session-agnostic fusion to maintain global semantic consistency, which is further stabilized by a Cosine Anchor Loss (CAL) to preserve prior knowledge. To enhance adaptation in the current session, an Orthogonal Projection Loss (OPL) ensures that new attribute and object embeddings remain distinct from previous ones, preventing overlap, while an Intra-Session Diversity Loss (IDL) promotes variation among current-session embeddings for richer, more discriminative representations. We also introduce a comprehensive protocol that jointly measures catastrophic forgetting and compositional generalization. Extensive experiments on UT-Zappos and C-GQA benchmarks demonstrate that PromptCCZSL achieves substantial improvements over prior VLM-based and non-VLM baselines, setting a new benchmark for CCZSL in closed-world settings.

*Hao Chen,Rui Yin,Yifan Chen,Qi Chen,Chao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Δ-LFM is a framework that models disease progression as a velocity field using Flow Matching, with patient-specific latent alignment to ensure trajectories are monotonic and semantically meaningful along disease severity axes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models for disease progression have limitations: they don't capture the inherent continuous and monotonic nature of disease dynamics, produce scattered latent representations lacking semantic structure, and diffusion models disrupt continuity with random denoising processes.

Method: Proposes Δ-LFM framework that treats disease dynamics as a velocity field using Flow Matching to align temporal evolution of patient data, plus learns patient-specific latent alignment to enforce trajectories along specific axes with magnitude increasing monotonically with disease severity.

Result: Demonstrates strong empirical performance across three longitudinal MRI benchmarks, offering a new framework for interpreting and visualizing disease dynamics with consistent and semantically meaningful latent space.

Conclusion: Δ-LFM provides an effective approach for modeling patient-specific latent progression that captures intrinsic disease dynamics while ensuring interpretable and clinically meaningful representations aligned with disease severity indicators.

Abstract: Understanding disease progression is a central clinical challenge with direct implications for early diagnosis and personalized treatment. While recent generative approaches have attempted to model progression, key mismatches remain: disease dynamics are inherently continuous and monotonic, yet latent representations are often scattered, lacking semantic structure, and diffusion-based models disrupt continuity with random denoising process. In this work, we propose to treat the disease dynamic as a velocity field and leverage Flow Matching (FM) to align the temporal evolution of patient data. Unlike prior methods, it captures the intrinsic dynamic of disease, making the progression more interpretable. However, a key challenge remains: in latent space, Auto-Encoders (AEs) do not guarantee alignment across patients or correlation with clinical-severity indicators (e.g., age and disease conditions). To address this, we propose to learn patient-specific latent alignment, which enforces patient trajectories to lie along a specific axis, with magnitude increasing monotonically with disease severity. This leads to a consistent and semantically meaningful latent space. Together, we present $Δ$-LFM, a framework for modeling patient-specific latent progression with flow matching. Across three longitudinal MRI benchmarks, $Δ$-LFM demonstrates strong empirical performance and, more importantly, offers a new framework for interpreting and visualizing disease dynamics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes View-on-Graph (VoG), a new VLM x SI paradigm for zero-shot 3D visual grounding that externalizes 3D spatial information into a scene graph, allowing VLMs to actively explore and retrieve only needed cues during reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot 3DVG approaches using VLM + SI paradigm create entangled visual representations that force VLMs to process entire cluttered cues, making it difficult to effectively exploit spatial semantic relationships.

Method: Introduces View-on-Graph (VoG) method that organizes 3D scenes into multi-modal, multi-layer scene graphs, enabling VLMs to act as active agents that selectively access necessary cues while traversing the scene graph incrementally.

Result: Extensive experiments show VoG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, demonstrating structured scene exploration as an effective strategy for advancing zero-shot 3DVG.

Conclusion: The VLM x SI paradigm with VoG lowers reasoning difficulty by structuring 3D context into coherent scene graphs and produces transparent, step-by-step traces for interpretable 3DVG, establishing a promising direction for zero-shot 3D visual grounding.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding (3DVG) identifies objects in 3D scenes from language descriptions. Existing zero-shot approaches leverage 2D vision-language models (VLMs) by converting 3D spatial information (SI) into forms amenable to VLM processing, typically as composite inputs such as specified view renderings or video sequences with overlaid object markers. However, this VLM + SI paradigm yields entangled visual representations that compel the VLM to process entire cluttered cues, making it hard to exploit spatial semantic relationships effectively. In this work, we propose a new VLM x SI paradigm that externalizes the 3D SI into a form enabling the VLM to incrementally retrieve only what it needs during reasoning. We instantiate this paradigm with a novel View-on-Graph (VoG) method, which organizes the scene into a multi-modal, multi-layer scene graph and allows the VLM to operate as an active agent that selectively accesses necessary cues as it traverses the scene. This design offers two intrinsic advantages: (i) by structuring 3D context into a spatially and semantically coherent scene graph rather than confounding the VLM with densely entangled visual inputs, it lowers the VLM's reasoning difficulty; and (ii) by actively exploring and reasoning over the scene graph, it naturally produces transparent, step-by-step traces for interpretable 3DVG. Extensive experiments show that VoG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, establishing structured scene exploration as a promising strategy for advancing zero-shot 3DVG.

Conclusion: Z-score normalization effectively compresses intermediate features in split-inference AI models, outperforming existing scaling methods in MPEG's FCM codec standard by reducing bitrate while maintaining or improving task accuracy.

Abstract: The split-inference paradigm divides an artificial intelligence (AI) model into two parts. This necessitates the transfer of intermediate feature data between the two halves.

Method: GLACIA framework integrates large language models with segmentation capabilities, using the GLake-Pos dataset pipeline with spatially grounded question-answer pairs for instance-aware positional reasoning.

Result: GLACIA achieves mIoU of 87.30, surpassing CNN-based methods (78.55-79.01), ViT-based methods (69.27-81.75), geo-foundation models (76.37-87.10), and reasoning-based segmentation methods (60.12-75.66).

Conclusion: GLACIA enables intuitive disaster preparedness and informed policy-making through natural language interaction, supporting more efficient and interpretable decision-making in rapidly changing glacial environments.

Abstract: Glacial lake monitoring bears great significance in mitigating the anticipated risk of Glacial Lake Outburst Floods. However, existing segmentation methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), remain constrained to pixel-level predictions, lacking high-level global scene semantics and human-interpretable reasoning. To address this, we introduce GLACIA (\textbf{G}lacial \textbf{LA}ke segmentation with \textbf{C}ontextual \textbf{I}nstance \textbf{A}wareness), the first framework that integrates large language models with segmentation capabilities to produce both accurate segmentation masks and corresponding spatial reasoning outputs. We construct the Glacial Lake Position Reasoning (GLake-Pos) dataset pipeline, which provides diverse, spatially grounded question-answer pairs designed to overcome the lack of instance-aware positional reasoning data in remote sensing. Comparative evaluation demonstrate that GLACIA (mIoU: 87.30) surpasses state-of-the-art method based on CNNs (mIoU: 78.55 - 79.01), ViTs (mIoU: 69.27 - 81.75), Geo-foundation models (mIoU: 76.37 - 87.10), and reasoning based segmentation methods (mIoU: 60.12 - 75.66). Our approach enables intuitive disaster preparedness and informed policy-making in the context of rapidly changing glacial environments by facilitating natural language interaction, thereby supporting more efficient and interpretable decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras offer advantages for facial expression recognition (high temporal resolution, low latency, computational efficiency, robustness in low-light), but existing deep learning methods are energy-intensive and difficult to deploy on edge devices for high-frequency event vision approaches.

Method: Proposed CS3D framework decomposes Convolutional 3D method to reduce computational complexity, utilizes soft spiking neurons and spatial-temporal attention mechanism to enhance information retention and improve facial expression detection accuracy.

Result: CS3D achieves higher accuracy on multiple datasets compared to RNN, Transformer, and C3D architectures, while consuming only 21.97% of the energy required by original C3D on the same device.

Conclusion: CS3D provides an efficient and accurate solution for event-based facial expression recognition that is suitable for deployment on edge computing devices in human-robot interaction scenarios.

Abstract: Responsive and accurate facial expression recognition is crucial to human-robot interaction for daily service robots. Nowadays, event cameras are becoming more widely adopted as they surpass RGB cameras in capturing facial expression changes due to their high temporal resolution, low latency, computational efficiency, and robustness in low-light conditions. Despite these advantages, event-based approaches still encounter practical challenges, particularly in adopting mainstream deep learning models. Traditional deep learning methods for facial expression analysis are energy-intensive, making them difficult to deploy on edge computing devices and thereby increasing costs, especially for high-frequency, dynamic, event vision-based approaches. To address this challenging issue, we proposed the CS3D framework by decomposing the Convolutional 3D method to reduce the computational complexity and energy consumption. Additionally, by utilizing soft spiking neurons and a spatial-temporal attention mechanism, the ability to retain information is enhanced, thus improving the accuracy of facial expression detection. Experimental results indicate that our proposed CS3D method attains higher accuracy on multiple datasets compared to architectures such as the RNN, Transformer, and C3D, while the energy consumption of the CS3D method is just 21.97\% of the original C3D required on the same device.

TL;DR: Using log RGB color space instead of standard sRGB improves NeRF performance by enabling better separation of illumination and reflectance, leading to higher quality renderings especially in low-light conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF typically uses sRGB images for supervision, but little attention has been paid to the color space for learning radiance fields. Inspired by the BiIlluminant Dichromatic Reflection (BIDR) model which suggests logarithmic transformation simplifies illumination/reflectance separation, the authors hypothesize that log RGB space enables NeRF to learn more compact and effective scene representations.

Method: Captured ~30 videos using GoPro camera with linear data recovery via inverse encoding. Trained NeRF models under different color space interpretations (linear, sRGB, GPLog, log RGB) by converting each network output to common color space before rendering and loss computation, enforcing representation learning in different color spaces.

Result: Log RGB color space consistently improves rendering quality, exhibits greater robustness across scenes, and performs particularly well in low light conditions while using same bit-depth input images. Further analysis across different network sizes and NeRF variants confirms generalization and stability of log space advantage.

Conclusion: Log RGB color space enables NeRF to learn more effective radiance field representations by better separating illumination and reflectance components, leading to improved performance across various conditions and network architectures.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved remarkable results in novel view synthesis, typically using sRGB images for supervision. However, little attention has been paid to the color space in which the network is learning the radiance field representation. Inspired by the BiIlluminant Dichromatic Reflection (BIDR) model, which suggests that a logarithmic transformation simplifies the separation of illumination and reflectance, we hypothesize that log RGB space enables NeRF to learn a more compact and effective representation of scene appearance. To test this, we captured approximately 30 videos using a GoPro camera, ensuring linear data recovery through inverse encoding. We trained NeRF models under various color space interpretations linear, sRGB, GPLog, and log RGB by converting each network output to a common color space before rendering and loss computation, enforcing representation learning in different color spaces. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that using a log RGB color space consistently improves rendering quality, exhibits greater robustness across scenes, and performs particularly well in low light conditions while using the same bit-depth input images. Further analysis across different network sizes and NeRF variants confirms the generalization and stability of the log space advantage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models struggle with generating or reconstructing layered PSD files with transparent alpha channels, which are essential for professional graphic design workflows.

Method: Uses a unified diffusion framework built on Flux ecosystem with two approaches: 1) text-to-PSD generation via spatial attention learning compositional relationships, and 2) image-to-PSD decomposition through iterative in-context editing with progressive extraction and erasing. Employs RGBA-VAE to preserve transparency without affecting structure learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on a new RGBA-layered dataset show OmniPSD achieves high-fidelity generation, structural consistency, and transparency awareness.

Conclusion: OmniPSD offers a new paradigm for layered design generation and decomposition with diffusion transformers, enabling both text-to-PSD generation and image-to-PSD decomposition.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have greatly improved image generation and editing, yet generating or reconstructing layered PSD files with transparent alpha channels remains highly challenging. We propose OmniPSD, a unified diffusion framework built upon the Flux ecosystem that enables both text-to-PSD generation and image-to-PSD decomposition through in-context learning. For text-to-PSD generation, OmniPSD arranges multiple target layers spatially into a single canvas and learns their compositional relationships through spatial attention, producing semantically coherent and hierarchically structured layers. For image-to-PSD decomposition, it performs iterative in-context editing, progressively extracting and erasing textual and foreground components to reconstruct editable PSD layers from a single flattened image. An RGBA-VAE is employed as an auxiliary representation module to preserve transparency without affecting structure learning. Extensive experiments on our new RGBA-layered dataset demonstrate that OmniPSD achieves high-fidelity generation, structural consistency, and transparency awareness, offering a new paradigm for layered design generation and decomposition with diffusion transformers.

Motivation: Current Vision-Language Model (VLM) methods for class-incremental learning still struggle with differentiating classes across different learning tasks, leading to class confusion and forgetting of old knowledge.

Method: Uses task-specific adapters on frozen pre-trained image encoder, cross-task representation calibration via mixture of light-weight projectors, and uncertainty-guided inference strategy for feature selection.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple datasets under various settings demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses class confusion in VLM-based continual learning and achieves state-of-the-art performance in class-incremental image classification.

Abstract: Class-incremental learning requires a learning system to continually learn knowledge of new classes and meanwhile try to preserve previously learned knowledge of old classes. As current state-of-the-art methods based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) still suffer from the issue of differentiating classes across learning tasks. Here a novel VLM-based continual learning framework for image classification is proposed. In this framework, task-specific adapters are added to the pre-trained and frozen image encoder to learn new knowledge, and a novel cross-task representation calibration strategy based on a mixture of light-weight projectors is used to help better separate all learned classes in a unified feature space, alleviating class confusion across tasks. In addition, a novel inference strategy guided by prediction uncertainty is developed to more accurately select the most appropriate image feature for class prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets under various settings demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to existing ones.

TL;DR: First computational framework for detecting Cytoplasmic Strings in human IVF embryos using deep learning with novel uncertainty-aware loss function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embryo selection is a critical bottleneck in IVF treatment. Cytoplasmic Strings (CS) are emerging biomarkers associated with better embryo viability, but current manual assessment is labor-intensive, subjective, and affected by detection difficulties.

Method: Two-stage deep learning framework: (1) human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline to create biologically validated CS dataset (13,568 frames), (2) frame-level CS classification using Novel Uncertainty-aware Contractive Embedding (NUCE) loss to handle severe imbalance, and (3) RF-DETR-based localization for CS region detection.

Result: NUCE loss consistently improves F1-score across five transformer backbones. RF-DETR achieves state-of-the-art detection performance for thin, low-contrast CS structures. The framework provides the first computational solution for CS analysis in human IVF embryos.

Conclusion: The proposed computational framework enables automated, objective assessment of Cytoplasmic Strings in human embryos, addressing limitations of manual inspection and potentially improving embryo selection in IVF treatment.

Abstract: Infertility is a major global health issue, and while in-vitro fertilization has improved treatment outcomes, embryo selection remains a critical bottleneck. Time-lapse imaging enables continuous, non-invasive monitoring of embryo development, yet most automated assessment methods rely solely on conventional morphokinetic features and overlook emerging biomarkers. Cytoplasmic Strings, thin filamentous structures connecting the inner cell mass and trophectoderm in expanded blastocysts, have been associated with faster blastocyst formation, higher blastocyst grades, and improved viability. However, CS assessment currently depends on manual visual inspection, which is labor-intensive, subjective, and severely affected by detection and subtle visual appearance. In this work, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first computational framework for CS analysis in human IVF embryos. We first design a human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline to curate a biologically validated CS dataset from TLI videos, comprising 13,568 frames with highly sparse CS-positive instances. Building on this dataset, we propose a two-stage deep learning framework that (i) classifies CS presence at the frame level and (ii) localizes CS regions in positive cases. To address severe imbalance and feature uncertainty, we introduce the Novel Uncertainty-aware Contractive Embedding (NUCE) loss, which couples confidence-aware reweighting with an embedding contraction term to form compact, well-separated class clusters. NUCE consistently improves F1-score across five transformer backbones, while RF-DETR-based localization achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) detection performance for thin, low-contrast CS structures.

TL;DR: MoRel introduces an Anchor Relay-based Bidirectional Blending (ARBB) mechanism for 4D Gaussian Splatting to handle long-range dynamic scenes with temporal consistency and memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 4DGS methods struggle with long-range dynamic videos, suffering from memory explosion, temporal flickering, and failure to handle appearing/disappearing occlusions over time.

Method: Proposes MoRel with ARBB mechanism: constructs local canonical anchor spaces at key-frames, models inter-frame deformations at anchor level, learns bidirectional deformations with adaptive blending, and uses Feature-variance-guided Hierarchical Densification (FHD).

Result: Achieves temporally coherent, flicker-free long-range 4D reconstruction with bounded memory usage; introduces new SelfCapLR dataset for evaluation with larger motion magnitude and wider spaces.

Conclusion: MoRel enables scalable and efficient dynamic Gaussian-based representations for long-range 4D motion, addressing key limitations of previous 4DGS approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) have extended the high-speed rendering capability of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) into the temporal domain, enabling real-time rendering of dynamic scenes. However, one of the major remaining challenges lies in modeling long-range motion-contained dynamic videos, where a naive extension of existing methods leads to severe memory explosion, temporal flickering, and failure to handle appearing or disappearing occlusions over time. To address these challenges, we propose a novel 4DGS framework characterized by an Anchor Relay-based Bidirectional Blending (ARBB) mechanism, named MoRel, which enables temporally consistent and memory-efficient modeling of long-range dynamic scenes. Our method progressively constructs locally canonical anchor spaces at key-frame time index and models inter-frame deformations at the anchor level, enhancing temporal coherence. By learning bidirectional deformations between KfA and adaptively blending them through learnable opacity control, our approach mitigates temporal discontinuities and flickering artifacts. We further introduce a Feature-variance-guided Hierarchical Densification (FHD) scheme that effectively densifies KfA's while keeping rendering quality, based on an assigned level of feature-variance. To effectively evaluate our model's capability to handle real-world long-range 4D motion, we newly compose long-range 4D motion-contained dataset, called SelfCap$_{\text{LR}}$. It has larger average dynamic motion magnitude, captured at spatially wider spaces, compared to previous dynamic video datasets. Overall, our MoRel achieves temporally coherent and flicker-free long-range 4D reconstruction while maintaining bounded memory usage, demonstrating both scalability and efficiency in dynamic Gaussian-based representations.

Abstract: The adoption of AI-powered computer vision in industry is often constrained by the need to balance operational utility with worker privacy. Building on our previously proposed privacy-preserving framework, this paper presents its first comprehensive validation on real-world data collected directly by industrial partners in active production environments. We evaluate the framework across three representative use cases: woodworking production monitoring, human-aware AGV navigation, and multi-camera ergonomic risk assessment. The approach employs learned visual transformations that obscure sensitive or task-irrelevant information while retaining features essential for task performance. Through both quantitative evaluation of the privacy-utility trade-off and qualitative feedback from industrial partners, we assess the framework's effectiveness, deployment feasibility, and trust implications. Results demonstrate that task-specific obfuscation enables effective monitoring with reduced privacy risks, establishing the framework's readiness for real-world adoption and providing cross-domain recommendations for responsible, human-centric AI deployment in industry.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongT2IBench: A benchmark with 14K long text-image pairs and graph-structured annotations for evaluating text-to-image alignment in long prompt scenarios, plus LongT2IExpert, an MLLM-based evaluator providing both scores and interpretations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2I alignment benchmarks focus on short prompts and provide only MOS/Likert scale annotations, lacking interpretability and hindering development of evaluators for long prompt scenarios.

Method: 1) Create LongT2IBench with 14K long text-image pairs using Generate-Refine-Qualify protocol to convert prompts into graph structures (entities, attributes, relations). 2) Develop LongT2IExpert, an MLLM-based evaluator instruction-tuned with Hierarchical Alignment Chain-of-Thought to provide both scores and structured interpretations.

Result: LongT2IBench provides fine-grained graph-structured annotations for long T2I alignment evaluation. LongT2IExpert demonstrates superiority in alignment evaluation and interpretation compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark and evaluator address the critical need for interpretable, automatic evaluation of text-image alignment in long prompt scenarios, advancing T2I evaluation research.

Abstract: The increasing popularity of long Text-to-Image (T2I) generation has created an urgent need for automatic and interpretable models that can evaluate the image-text alignment in long prompt scenarios. However, the existing T2I alignment benchmarks predominantly focus on short prompt scenarios and only provide MOS or Likert scale annotations. This inherent limitation hinders the development of long T2I evaluators, particularly in terms of the interpretability of alignment. In this study, we contribute LongT2IBench, which comprises 14K long text-image pairs accompanied by graph-structured human annotations. Given the detail-intensive nature of long prompts, we first design a Generate-Refine-Qualify annotation protocol to convert them into textual graph structures that encompass entities, attributes, and relations. Through this transformation, fine-grained alignment annotations are achieved based on these granular elements. Finally, the graph-structed annotations are converted into alignment scores and interpretations to facilitate the design of T2I evaluation models. Based on LongT2IBench, we further propose LongT2IExpert, a LongT2I evaluator that enables multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to provide both quantitative scores and structured interpretations through an instruction-tuning process with Hierarchical Alignment Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LongT2IExpert in alignment evaluation and interpretation. Data and code have been released in https://welldky.github.io/LongT2IBench-Homepage/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloud cover in multispectral imagery corrupts spectral information, hindering early-season crop mapping. Existing ViT-based methods use coarse temporal embeddings that cause information loss and reduce reconstruction accuracy.

Method: Proposes Video Vision Transformer (ViViT)-based framework with temporal-spatial fusion embedding.

Conclusion: The proposed ViViT-based framework effectively enhances spectral reconstruction quality for robust agricultural monitoring by addressing limitations of existing ViT-based time-series reconstruction methods.

Abstract: Cloud cover in multispectral imagery (MSI) significantly hinders early-season crop mapping by corrupting spectral information. Existing Vision Transformer(ViT)-based time-series reconstruction methods, like SMTS-ViT, often employ coarse temporal embeddings that aggregate entire sequences, causing substantial information loss and reducing reconstruction accuracy. To address these limitations, a Video Vision Transformer (ViViT)-based framework with temporal-spatial fusion embedding for MSI reconstruction in cloud-covered regions is proposed in this study. Non-overlapping tubelets are extracted via 3D convolution with constrained temporal span $(t=2)$, ensuring local temporal coherence while reducing cross-day information degradation. Both MSI-only and SAR-MSI fusion scenarios are considered during the experiments. Comprehensive experiments on 2020 Traill County data demonstrate notable performance improvements: MTS-ViViT achieves a 2.23\% reduction in MSE compared to the MTS-ViT baseline, while SMTS-ViViT achieves a 10.33\% improvement with SAR integration over the SMTS-ViT baseline. The proposed framework effectively enhances spectral reconstruction quality for robust agricultural monitoring.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parkinson's disease significantly impacts patients' daily functioning, and current diagnostic approaches need to be more efficient and accessible. The research aims to leverage hypomimia (reduced facial expressivity and facial rigidity) as a characteristic clinical symptom for developing a non-invasive, convenient diagnostic method.

Method: Developed a multimodal facial expression analysis network using CLIP architecture to integrate visual and textual features while preserving temporal dynamics. Extracted expression intensity features during various facial expressions, then processed these features through an LSTM-based classification network for PD diagnosis.

Result: Achieved 93.1% accuracy in PD diagnosis, outperforming other in-vitro PD diagnostic approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed dynamic facial expression analysis method offers a more convenient, accessible, and efficient diagnostic approach for Parkinson's disease, improving the diagnostic experience for potential patients through non-invasive facial expression monitoring.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD), a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, significantly affects patients' daily functioning and social interactions. To facilitate a more efficient and accessible diagnostic approach for PD, we propose a dynamic facial expression analysis-based PD auxiliary diagnosis method. This method targets hypomimia, a characteristic clinical symptom of PD, by analyzing two manifestations: reduced facial expressivity and facial rigidity, thereby facilitating the diagnosis process. We develop a multimodal facial expression analysis network to extract expression intensity features during patients' performance of various facial expressions. This network leverages the CLIP architecture to integrate visual and textual features while preserving the temporal dynamics of facial expressions. Subsequently, the expression intensity features are processed and input into an LSTM-based classification network for PD diagnosis. Our method achieves an accuracy of 93.1%, outperforming other in-vitro PD diagnostic approaches. This technique offers a more convenient detection method for potential PD patients, improving their diagnostic experience.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stable Diffusion encodes color information in circular, opponent axes in specific latent channels (c_3, c_4), while intensity and shape are in other channels (c_1, c_2), revealing an interpretable, efficient coding structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in diffusion models achieving high visual fidelity, there's limited understanding of how specific perceptual attributes like color and shape are internally represented in these generative models.

Method: Systematic analysis of Stable Diffusion's latent representations using controlled synthetic datasets, principal component analysis (PCA), and similarity metrics to examine how color information is encoded.

Result: Color information is encoded along circular, opponent axes predominantly in latent channels c_3 and c_4, while intensity and shape are primarily represented in channels c_1 and c_2, showing an interpretable structure aligned with efficient coding.

Conclusion: The latent space of Stable Diffusion exhibits an interpretable structure that provides a foundation for model understanding, editing applications, and designing more disentangled generative frameworks.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have achieved remarkable visual fidelity, yet a detailed understanding of how specific perceptual attributes - such as color and shape - are internally represented remains limited. This work explores how color is encoded in a generative model through a systematic analysis of the latent representations in Stable Diffusion. Through controlled synthetic datasets, principal component analysis (PCA) and similarity metrics, we reveal that color information is encoded along circular, opponent axes predominantly captured in latent channels c_3 and c_4, whereas intensity and shape are primarily represented in channels c_1 and c_2. Our findings indicate that the latent space of Stable Diffusion exhibits an interpretable structure aligned with a efficient coding representation. These insights provide a foundation for future work in model understanding, editing applications, and the design of more disentangled generative frameworks.

TL;DR: LoGoColor: A 3D colorization method that preserves color diversity by eliminating guidance averaging and ensuring multi-view consistency through local-global scene partitioning and fine-tuned diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D colorization methods suffer from color averaging during training, leading to monotonous and oversimplified results, especially in complex 360° scenes. The authors aim to preserve color diversity while ensuring multi-view consistency.

Method: Proposes LoGoColor pipeline with a 'Local-Global' approach: partitions scenes into subscenes and addresses both inter-subscene and intra-subscene consistency using a fine-tuned multi-view diffusion model to generate consistently colorized training views.

Result: Achieves quantitatively and qualitatively more consistent and plausible 3D colorization on complex 360° scenes than existing methods, with superior color diversity validated by a novel Color Diversity Index.

Conclusion: LoGoColor successfully preserves color diversity in 3D reconstruction by eliminating guidance averaging and ensuring multi-view consistency through local-global scene partitioning, outperforming existing methods on complex 360° scenes.

Abstract: Single-channel 3D reconstruction is widely used in fields such as robotics and medical imaging. While this line of work excels at reconstructing 3D geometry, the outputs are not colored 3D models, thus 3D colorization is required for visualization. Recent 3D colorization studies address this problem by distilling 2D image colorization models. However, these approaches suffer from an inherent inconsistency of 2D image models. This results in colors being averaged during training, leading to monotonous and oversimplified results, particularly in complex 360° scenes. In contrast, we aim to preserve color diversity by generating a new set of consistently colorized training views, thereby bypassing the averaging process. Nevertheless, eliminating the averaging process introduces a new challenge: ensuring strict multi-view consistency across these colorized views. To achieve this, we propose LoGoColor, a pipeline designed to preserve color diversity by eliminating this guidance-averaging process with a `Local-Global' approach: we partition the scene into subscenes and explicitly tackle both inter-subscene and intra-subscene consistency using a fine-tuned multi-view diffusion model. We demonstrate that our method achieves quantitatively and qualitatively more consistent and plausible 3D colorization on complex 360° scenes than existing methods, and validate its superior color diversity using a novel Color Diversity Index.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Transformers (ViTs) outperform CNNs in global context understanding tasks, with hybrid/hierarchical models like Swin and CvT offering best accuracy-efficiency balance, especially in medical imaging with data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs struggle with global image context understanding due to local pattern focus, while Vision Transformers use self-attention for whole-image relationships, prompting comparison across vision tasks.

Method: Comprehensive comparison of ViT variants (pure, hierarchical, hybrid) vs CNNs on ImageNet (classification), COCO (detection), and ChestX-ray14 (medical imaging) with data augmentation experiments.

Result: Hybrid/hierarchical transformers (Swin, CvT) achieve best accuracy-efficiency trade-off; data augmentation significantly boosts medical image performance, especially with Swin Transformer; ViTs generally outperform CNNs.

Conclusion: Vision Transformers are competitive and often superior to CNNs, particularly for global context tasks like medical imaging, with hybrid/hierarchical architectures offering optimal performance-resource balance.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for computer vision sometimes struggle with understanding images in a global context, as they mainly focus on local patterns. On the other hand, Vision Transformers (ViTs), inspired by models originally created for language processing, use self-attention mechanisms, which allow them to understand relationships across the entire image. In this paper, we compare different types of ViTs (pure, hierarchical, and hybrid) against traditional CNN models across various tasks, including object recognition, detection, and medical image classification. We conduct thorough tests on standard datasets like ImageNet for image classification and COCO for object detection. Additionally, we apply these models to medical imaging using the ChestX-ray14 dataset. We find that hybrid and hierarchical transformers, especially Swin and CvT, offer a strong balance between accuracy and computational resources. Furthermore, by experimenting with data augmentation techniques on medical images, we discover significant performance improvements, particularly with the Swin Transformer model. Overall, our results indicate that Vision Transformers are competitive and, in many cases, outperform traditional CNNs, especially in scenarios requiring the understanding of global visual contexts like medical imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image restoration foundation models focus on data scale and quality, but overlook the critical importance of data mixture proportions from different restoration tasks, which directly affects overall performance of all-in-one models.

Method: Proposes FoundIR-v2 with two key innovations: 1) Data equilibrium scheduling paradigm that dynamically optimizes mixed training dataset proportions using data mixing laws, and 2) Mixture-of-Experts-driven scheduler for generative pre-training that allocates task-adaptive diffusion priors for each restoration task based on distinct degradation forms and levels.

Result: The method can address over 50 sub-tasks across a broad scope of real-world scenarios and achieves favorable performance against state-of-the-art approaches in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Data mixture proportions are critical for all-in-one image restoration models, and FoundIR-v2's data equilibrium scheduling with MoE-driven diffusion priors enables consistent generalization and comprehensive performance across diverse restoration tasks.

Abstract: Recent studies have witnessed significant advances in image restoration foundation models driven by improvements in the scale and quality of pre-training data. In this work, we find that the data mixture proportions from different restoration tasks are also a critical factor directly determining the overall performance of all-in-one image restoration models. To this end, we propose a high-capacity diffusion-based image restoration foundation model, FoundIR-v2, which adopts a data equilibrium scheduling paradigm to dynamically optimize the proportions of mixed training datasets from different tasks. By leveraging the data mixing law, our method ensures a balanced dataset composition, enabling the model to achieve consistent generalization and comprehensive performance across diverse tasks. Furthermore, we introduce an effective Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-driven scheduler into generative pre-training to flexibly allocate task-adaptive diffusion priors for each restoration task, accounting for the distinct degradation forms and levels exhibited by different tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can address over 50 sub-tasks across a broader scope of real-world scenarios and achieves favorable performance against state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: The paper proposes that concise reasoning with compressed visual tokens is sufficient for effective video reasoning, challenging the need for lengthy CoT chains in MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video reasoning models rely on lengthy reasoning chains and large numbers of visual tokens, which may be inefficient. The authors hypothesize that concise reasoning with reduced visual tokens could be equally effective and more efficient.

Method: Design an efficient post-training and inference framework that enables video MLLMs to operate on compressed visual tokens and generate brief reasoning traces before answering, without requiring manual CoT annotations or supervised fine-tuning.

Result: The resulting models achieve substantially improved inference efficiency while delivering competitive performance across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: Long, human-like CoT reasoning may not be necessary for general video reasoning; concise reasoning can be both effective and efficient.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has been highly successful in solving complex tasks in natural language processing, and recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have extended this paradigm to video reasoning. However, these models typically build on lengthy reasoning chains and large numbers of input visual tokens. Motivated by empirical observations from our benchmark study, we hypothesize that concise reasoning combined with a reduced set of visual tokens can be sufficient for effective video reasoning. To evaluate this hypothesis, we design and validate an efficient post-training and inference framework that enhances a video MLLM's reasoning capability. Our framework enables models to operate on compressed visual tokens and generate brief reasoning traces prior to answering. The resulting models achieve substantially improved inference efficiency, deliver competitive performance across diverse benchmarks, and avoid reliance on manual CoT annotations or supervised fine-tuning. Collectively, our results suggest that long, human-like CoT reasoning may not be necessary for general video reasoning, and that concise reasoning can be both effective and efficient.

Abstract: Automated skin lesion classification using deep learning has shown remarkable accuracy, yet clinical adoption remains limited due to the "black box" nature of these models. We present MelanomaNet, an explainable deep learning system for multi-class skin lesion classification that addresses this gap through four complementary interpretability mechanisms. Our approach combines an EfficientNet V2 backbone with GradCAM++ attention visualization, automated ABCDE clinical criterion extraction, Fast Concept Activation Vectors (FastCAV) for concept-based explanations, and Monte Carlo Dropout uncertainty quantification. We evaluate our system on the ISIC 2019 dataset containing 25,331 dermoscopic images across 9 diagnostic categories.

Result: Tested on CANDELS astronomical dataset with U-Net, SwinUNet, and Learnlets models, providing new perspectives on hallucination in deep learning-based image processing.

Conclusion: CHEM enables efficient identification and quantification of hallucination artifacts in any image reconstruction model, with theoretical exploration of why U-shaped networks are prone to hallucinations.

Abstract: U-Net and other U-shaped architectures have achieved significant success in image deconvolution tasks. However, challenges have emerged, as these methods might generate unrealistic artifacts or hallucinations, which can interfere with analysis in safety-critical scenarios. This paper introduces a novel approach for quantifying and comprehending hallucination artifacts to ensure trustworthy computer vision models. Our method, termed the Conformal Hallucination Estimation Metric (CHEM), is applicable to any image reconstruction model, enabling efficient identification and quantification of hallucination artifacts. It offers two key advantages: it leverages wavelet and shearlet representations to efficiently extract hallucinations of image features and uses conformalized quantile regression to assess hallucination levels in a distribution-free manner. Furthermore, from an approximation theoretical perspective, we explore the reasons why U-shaped networks are prone to hallucinations. We test the proposed approach on the CANDELS astronomical image dataset with models such as U-Net, SwinUNet, and Learnlets, and provide new perspectives on hallucination from different aspects in deep learning-based image processing.

*Songhan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Improved YOLOv8n-SPTS model enhances small traffic target detection in autonomous driving using SPD-Conv, SPPFCSPC, and TSFP modules, achieving state-of-the-art performance on VisDrone2019-DET dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autonomous driving algorithms struggle with small target recognition due to information loss, scale imbalance, and occlusion, leading to poor detection performance for critical traffic elements like pedestrians and bicycles.

Method: Three key improvements: 1) Replace 4 convolution modules with SPD-Conv to preserve fine-grained information; 2) Introduce SPPFCSPC module combining SPP and CSP for better multi-scale feature fusion; 3) Design TSFP structure with dedicated 160*160 small target detection head while removing redundant large target heads.

Result: On VisDrone2019-DET dataset: achieves 61.9% precision, 48.3% recall, 52.6% mAP@0.5, and 32.6% mAP@0.5:0.95 - ranking first in all metrics. Visualization shows significantly reduced miss rates for pedestrians and bicycles in occluded/dense scenes.

Conclusion: The proposed YOLOv8n-SPTS model effectively addresses small target detection challenges in autonomous driving through architectural improvements that enhance feature preservation, multi-scale fusion, and dedicated small target processing, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the key issue in autonomous driving: small target recognition in dynamic perception. Existing algorithms suffer from poor detection performance due to missing small target information, scale imbalance, and occlusion. We propose an improved YOLOv8n-SPTS model, which enhances the detection accuracy of small traffic targets through three key innovations: First, optimizing the feature extraction module. In the Backbone Bottleneck structure of YOLOv8n, 4 traditional convolution modules are replaced with Space-to-Depth Convolution (SPD-Conv) modules. This module retains fine-grained information through space-to-depth conversion, reduces information loss, and enhances the ability to capture features of low-resolution small targets. Second, enhancing feature fusion capability. The Spatial Pyramid Pooling - Fast Cross Stage Partial Connection (SPPFCSPC) module is introduced to replace the original SPPF module, integrating the multi-scale feature extraction from Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) and the feature fusion mechanism of Cross Stage Partial Connection (CSP), thereby improving the model's contextual understanding of complex scenes and multi-scale feature expression ability. Third, designing a dedicated detection structure for small targets. A Triple-Stage Feature Pyramid (TSFP) structure is proposed, which adds a 160*160 small target detection head to the original detection heads to fully utilize high-resolution features in shallow layers; meanwhile, redundant large target detection heads are removed to balance computational efficiency. Comparative experiments on the VisDrone2019-DET dataset show that YOLOv8n-SPTS model ranks first in precision (61.9%), recall (48.3%), mAP@0.5 (52.6%), and mAP@0.5:0.95 (32.6%). Visualization results verify that the miss rate of small targets such as pedestrians and bicycles in occluded and dense scenes is significantly reduced.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual concept composition methods struggle with accurately extracting complex concepts from visual inputs and flexibly combining concepts from both images and videos.

Method: Uses hierarchical binder structure for cross-attention conditioning in Diffusion Transformers to encode visual concepts into prompt tokens. Includes Diversify-and-Absorb Mechanism to improve binding accuracy by eliminating concept-irrelevant details, and Temporal Disentanglement Strategy with dual-branch binder for video concept compatibility.

Result: Achieves superior concept consistency, prompt fidelity, and motion quality over existing approaches, opening new possibilities for visual creativity.

Conclusion: Bind & Compose enables flexible and accurate visual concept composition by effectively binding visual concepts to prompt tokens and handling both image and video concepts through innovative mechanisms.

Abstract: Visual concept composition, which aims to integrate different elements from images and videos into a single, coherent visual output, still falls short in accurately extracting complex concepts from visual inputs and flexibly combining concepts from both images and videos. We introduce Bind & Compose, a one-shot method that enables flexible visual concept composition by binding visual concepts with corresponding prompt tokens and composing the target prompt with bound tokens from various sources. It adopts a hierarchical binder structure for cross-attention conditioning in Diffusion Transformers to encode visual concepts into corresponding prompt tokens for accurate decomposition of complex visual concepts. To improve concept-token binding accuracy, we design a Diversify-and-Absorb Mechanism that uses an extra absorbent token to eliminate the impact of concept-irrelevant details when training with diversified prompts. To enhance the compatibility between image and video concepts, we present a Temporal Disentanglement Strategy that decouples the training process of video concepts into two stages with a dual-branch binder structure for temporal modeling. Evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves superior concept consistency, prompt fidelity, and motion quality over existing approaches, opening up new possibilities for visual creativity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation benchmarks lack convincing evaluations for audio-video generation, especially for models aiming to generate synchronized audio-video outputs.

Method: Introduces VABench with three primary task types (T2AV, I2AV, stereo audio-video generation) and two major evaluation modules covering 15 dimensions including pairwise similarities, audio-video synchronization, lip-speech consistency, and curated QA pairs across seven content categories.

Result: Provides a systematic analysis and visualization of evaluation results to establish a new standard for assessing video generation models with synchronous audio capabilities.

Conclusion: VABench aims to address the gap in audio-video generation evaluation and promote comprehensive advancement in the field of synchronous audio-video generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have been remarkable, enabling models to produce visually compelling videos with synchronized audio. While existing video generation benchmarks provide comprehensive metrics for visual quality, they lack convincing evaluations for audio-video generation, especially for models aiming to generate synchronized audio-video outputs. To address this gap, we introduce VABench, a comprehensive and multi-dimensional benchmark framework designed to systematically evaluate the capabilities of synchronous audio-video generation. VABench encompasses three primary task types: text-to-audio-video (T2AV), image-to-audio-video (I2AV), and stereo audio-video generation. It further establishes two major evaluation modules covering 15 dimensions. These dimensions specifically assess pairwise similarities (text-video, text-audio, video-audio), audio-video synchronization, lip-speech consistency, and carefully curated audio and video question-answering (QA) pairs, among others. Furthermore, VABench covers seven major content categories: animals, human sounds, music, environmental sounds, synchronous physical sounds, complex scenes, and virtual worlds. We provide a systematic analysis and visualization of the evaluation results, aiming to establish a new standard for assessing video generation models with synchronous audio capabilities and to promote the comprehensive advancement of the field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedForget is a hierarchical multimodal unlearning testbed for medical AI that enables fine-grained assessment of data removal across eight organizational levels to address privacy compliance in healthcare.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical MLLMs trained on sensitive patient data face privacy challenges under regulations like HIPAA/GDPR that enforce "right to be forgotten" - existing unlearning methods lack systematic evaluation in complex medical settings with hierarchical data structures.

Method: Introduced MedForget benchmark with 3840 multimodal instances modeling hospital data as nested hierarchy (Institution→Patient→Study→Section), with explicit retain/forget splits and evaluation sets containing rephrased variants; tested four SOTA unlearning methods on three tasks and introduced reconstruction attack to test hierarchical pathway deletion.

Result: Existing unlearning methods struggle with complete hierarchy-aware forgetting without reducing diagnostic performance; coarse-grained unlearning resists reconstruction attacks while fine-grained unlearning leaves models vulnerable to hierarchical context reconstruction.

Conclusion: MedForget provides a HIPAA-aligned testbed for building compliant medical AI systems, revealing that current unlearning approaches cannot adequately address hierarchical medical data structures while maintaining diagnostic utility.

Abstract: Pretrained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in medical AI systems for clinical reasoning, diagnosis support, and report generation. However, their training on sensitive patient data raises critical privacy and compliance challenges under regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR, which enforce the "right to be forgotten". Unlearning, the process of tuning models to selectively remove the influence of specific training data points, offers a potential solution, yet its effectiveness in complex medical settings remains underexplored. To systematically study this, we introduce MedForget, a Hierarchy-Aware Multimodal Unlearning Testbed with explicit retain and forget splits and evaluation sets containing rephrased variants. MedForget models hospital data as a nested hierarchy (Institution -> Patient -> Study -> Section), enabling fine-grained assessment across eight organizational levels. The benchmark contains 3840 multimodal (image, question, answer) instances, each hierarchy level having a dedicated unlearning target, reflecting distinct unlearning challenges. Experiments with four SOTA unlearning methods on three tasks (generation, classification, cloze) show that existing methods struggle to achieve complete, hierarchy-aware forgetting without reducing diagnostic performance. To test whether unlearning truly deletes hierarchical pathways, we introduce a reconstruction attack that progressively adds hierarchical level context to prompts. Models unlearned at a coarse granularity show strong resistance, while fine-grained unlearning leaves models vulnerable to such reconstruction. MedForget provides a practical, HIPAA-aligned testbed for building compliant medical AI systems.

*Shivanshu Agnihotri,Snehashis Majhi,Deepak Ranjan Nayak,Debesh Jha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Polyp-DiFoM: A distillation framework that transfers rich representations from large vision foundation models to lightweight polyp segmentation baselines for efficient and accurate clinical deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lightweight polyp segmentation models (U-Net, U-Net++, PraNet) struggle with polyp variations and camouflage, while large vision foundation models (SAM, DINOv2, etc.) have impressive generalization but can't be directly applied to medical imaging due to dataset scarcity and domain knowledge gaps.

Method: A distillation framework that infuses semantic priors from foundation models into lightweight architectures (U-Net, U-Net++) with frequency domain encoding for enhanced distillation, improving generalization capability.

Result: Consistently outperforms baseline models and state-of-the-art across five benchmark datasets (Kvasir-SEG, CVC-ClinicDB, ETIS, ColonDB, CVC-300) with nearly 9 times reduced computation overhead.

Conclusion: Polyp-DiFoM effectively bridges the gap between foundation models and medical imaging tasks, enabling efficient and accurate polyp segmentation for clinical deployment while maintaining low computational cost.

Abstract: Accurate polyp segmentation during colonoscopy is critical for the early detection of colorectal cancer and still remains challenging due to significant size, shape, and color variations, and the camouflaged nature of polyps. While lightweight baseline models such as U-Net, U-Net++, and PraNet offer advantages in terms of easy deployment and low computational cost, they struggle to deal with the above issues, leading to limited segmentation performance. In contrast, large-scale vision foundation models such as SAM, DINOv2, OneFormer, and Mask2Former have exhibited impressive generalization performance across natural image domains. However, their direct transfer to medical imaging tasks (e.g., colonoscopic polyp segmentation) is not straightforward, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale datasets and lack of domain-specific knowledge. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel distillation framework, Polyp-DiFoM, that transfers the rich representations of foundation models into lightweight segmentation baselines, allowing efficient and accurate deployment in clinical settings. In particular, we infuse semantic priors from the foundation models into canonical architectures such as U-Net and U-Net++ and further perform frequency domain encoding for enhanced distillation, corroborating their generalization capability. Extensive experiments are performed across five benchmark datasets, such as Kvasir-SEG, CVC-ClinicDB, ETIS, ColonDB, and CVC-300. Notably, Polyp-DiFoM consistently outperforms respective baseline models significantly, as well as the state-of-the-art model, with nearly 9 times reduced computation overhead.

Abstract: Suspiciousness estimation is critical for proactive threat detection and ensuring public safety in complex environments. This work introduces a large-scale annotated dataset, USE50k, along with a computationally efficient vision-based framework for real-time suspiciousness analysis. The USE50k dataset contains 65,500 images captured from diverse and uncontrolled environments, such as airports, railway stations, restaurants, parks, and other public areas, covering a broad spectrum of cues including weapons, fire, crowd density, abnormal facial expressions, and unusual body postures. Building on this dataset, we present DeepUSEvision, a lightweight and modular system integrating three key components, i.e., a Suspicious Object Detector based on an enhanced YOLOv12 architecture, dual Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN-I and DCNN-II) for facial expression and body-language recognition using image and landmark features, and a transformer-based Discriminator Network that adaptively fuses multimodal outputs to yield an interpretable suspiciousness score. Extensive experiments confirm the superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability of the proposed framework compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Collectively, the USE50k dataset and the DeepUSEvision framework establish a strong and scalable foundation for intelligent surveillance and real-time risk assessment in safety-critical applications.

Conclusion: LNMBench provides standardized evaluation revealing LNL methods' limitations in medical imaging, offers practical insights for noise-resilient algorithm development, and releases codebase to promote reproducible research in medical applications.

Abstract: Learning from noisy labels remains a major challenge in medical image analysis, where annotation demands expert knowledge and substantial inter-observer variability often leads to inconsistent or erroneous labels.

### [63] [UniLS: End-to-End Audio-Driven Avatars for Unified Listening and Speaking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09327)
*Xuangeng Chu,Ruicong Liu,Yifei Huang,Yun Liu,Yichen Peng,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniLS is the first end-to-end framework for generating unified speak-listen facial expressions using only dual-track audio, solving the listener modeling challenge through a two-stage training approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with modeling realistic listener behavior in conversational avatars - direct audio-driven training fails for listeners, producing stiff motions. Most methods focus only on speaking generation, and the only prior joint generation approach requires extra speaker motion input, making it non-end-to-end and impractical for real-time applications.

Method: Two-stage training paradigm: Stage 1 learns internal motion prior using an audio-free autoregressive generator to capture natural facial dynamics. Stage 2 introduces dual-track audio to fine-tune the generator, modulating the learned motion prior based on external speech cues while maintaining end-to-end audio-only input.

Result: UniLS achieves state-of-the-art speaking accuracy and delivers up to 44.1% improvement in listening metrics, generating significantly more diverse and natural listening expressions that effectively mitigate the stiffness problem in previous approaches.

Conclusion: UniLS provides a practical, high-fidelity audio-driven solution for interactive digital humans by enabling unified speak-listen expression generation through an end-to-end framework that addresses the fundamental imbalance between speaker and listener motion dynamics.

Abstract: Generating lifelike conversational avatars requires modeling not just isolated speakers, but the dynamic, reciprocal interaction of speaking and listening. However, modeling the listener is exceptionally challenging: direct audio-driven training fails, producing stiff, static listening motions. This failure stems from a fundamental imbalance: the speaker's motion is strongly driven by speech audio, while the listener's motion primarily follows an internal motion prior and is only loosely guided by external speech. This challenge has led most methods to focus on speak-only generation. The only prior attempt at joint generation relies on extra speaker's motion to produce the listener. This design is not end-to-end, thereby hindering the real-time applicability. To address this limitation, we present UniLS, the first end-to-end framework for generating unified speak-listen expressions, driven by only dual-track audio. Our method introduces a novel two-stage training paradigm. Stage 1 first learns the internal motion prior by training an audio-free autoregressive generator, capturing the spontaneous dynamics of natural facial motion. Stage 2 then introduces the dual-track audio, fine-tuning the generator to modulate the learned motion prior based on external speech cues. Extensive evaluations show UniLS achieves state-of-the-art speaking accuracy. More importantly, it delivers up to 44.1\% improvement in listening metrics, generating significantly more diverse and natural listening expressions. This effectively mitigates the stiffness problem and provides a practical, high-fidelity audio-driven solution for interactive digital humans.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NeRF and 3DGS methods for human avatar modeling often produce unsatisfactory results with insufficient geometrical details related to body motion (like clothing wrinkles), lacking photo-realistic quality.

Method: Proposes a 3DGS-based framework with dynamic skinning weights for pose-based articulation, learns additional motion-induced deformations, introduces novel regularization for fine geometric details under sparse visual cues, and creates a new multi-view dataset with varied lighting for evaluation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis, novel pose rendering, and relighting, enabling realistic rendering of novel poses and views with photo-realistic lighting effects under arbitrary conditions.

Conclusion: RnD-Avatar successfully addresses limitations of previous methods by capturing fine geometric details and enabling relightable, animatable human avatars with high-fidelity results from monocular video.

Abstract: Modeling relightable and animatable human avatars from monocular video is a long-standing and challenging task. Recently, Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods have been employed to reconstruct the avatars. However, they often produce unsatisfactory photo-realistic results because of insufficient geometrical details related to body motion, such as clothing wrinkles. In this paper, we propose a 3DGS-based human avatar modeling framework, termed as Relightable and Dynamic Gaussian Avatar (RnD-Avatar), that presents accurate pose-variant deformation for high-fidelity geometrical details. To achieve this, we introduce dynamic skinning weights that define the human avatar's articulation based on pose while also learning additional deformations induced by body motion. We also introduce a novel regularization to capture fine geometric details under sparse visual cues. Furthermore, we present a new multi-view dataset with varied lighting conditions to evaluate relight. Our framework enables realistic rendering of novel poses and views while supporting photo-realistic lighting effects under arbitrary lighting conditions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis, novel pose rendering, and relighting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based text-to-image models struggle with accurate text rendering, particularly with text omission where desired text is partially or completely missing. Existing methods focus on fine-tuning or refinement but overlook this critical issue.

Method: Analyzes attention patterns in MM-DiT models for text-related tokens, then applies latent guidance during early denoising steps using two novel loss functions that align textual content tokens with text regions in the image.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in test-time text rendering with significant gains in recall, strong OCR accuracy, and improved CLIP scores.

Conclusion: TextGuider effectively addresses text omission in diffusion models through training-free latent guidance, enabling more accurate and complete text appearance without requiring model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Despite recent advances, diffusion-based text-to-image models still struggle with accurate text rendering. Several studies have proposed fine-tuning or training-free refinement methods for accurate text rendering. However, the critical issue of text omission, where the desired text is partially or entirely missing, remains largely overlooked. In this work, we propose TextGuider, a novel training-free method that encourages accurate and complete text appearance by aligning textual content tokens and text regions in the image. Specifically, we analyze attention patterns in MM-DiT models, particularly for text-related tokens intended to be rendered in the image. Leveraging this observation, we apply latent guidance during the early stage of denoising steps based on two loss functions that we introduce. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in test-time text rendering, with significant gains in recall and strong results in OCR accuracy and CLIP score.

TL;DR: Video-QTR is a lightweight framework that uses query-driven temporal reasoning to reduce computational overhead in video understanding by dynamically allocating perceptual resources based on semantic intent, achieving SOTA performance with up to 73% fewer frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal LLMs for video understanding are computationally intensive due to dense frame encoding, which generates excessive visual tokens, consumes high memory, and has redundant computation. The traditional "process-then-reason" paradigm is inefficient for long-video applications.

Method: Video-QTR introduces query-driven temporal reasoning that redefines video comprehension as a query-guided process. Instead of encoding every frame, it dynamically allocates perceptual resources based on the semantic intent of the query, creating an adaptive feedback loop between reasoning and perception.

Result: Extensive experiments across five benchmarks (MSVD-QA, Activity Net-QA, Movie Chat, and Video MME) demonstrate state-of-the-art performance while reducing input frame consumption by up to 73%.

Conclusion: Query-driven temporal reasoning provides an efficient and scalable solution for video understanding, addressing computational inefficiencies of traditional approaches while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: The rapid development of multimodal large-language models (MLLMs) has significantly expanded the scope of visual language reasoning, enabling unified systems to interpret and describe complex visual content. However, applying these models to long-video understanding remains computationally intensive. Dense frame encoding generates excessive visual tokens, leading to high memory consumption, redundant computation, and limited scalability in real-world applications. This inefficiency highlights a key limitation of the traditional process-then-reason paradigm, which analyzes visual streams exhaustively before semantic reasoning. To address this challenge, we introduce Video-QTR (Query-Driven Temporal Reasoning), a lightweight framework that redefines video comprehension as a query-guided reasoning process. Instead of encoding every frame, Video-QTR dynamically allocates perceptual resources based on the semantic intent of the query, creating an adaptive feedback loop between reasoning and perception. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks: MSVD-QA, Activity Net-QA, Movie Chat, and Video MME demonstrate that Video-QTR achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing input frame consumption by up to 73%.

Method: The framework jointly conditions on monocular video input with explicit geometry-aware regularization for 3D structural fidelity, integrates spatio-temporal tiling for efficient high-resolution synthesis, and uses a curated 11M-frame stereo video dataset aligned to natural human IPD.

Result: StereoWorld substantially outperforms prior methods, generating stereo videos with superior visual fidelity and geometric consistency as demonstrated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: StereoWorld provides an effective solution for high-quality stereo video generation that addresses the cost and artifact challenges of traditional production methods, enabling better content creation for XR devices.

Abstract: The growing adoption of XR devices has fueled strong demand for high-quality stereo video, yet its production remains costly and artifact-prone. To address this challenge, we present StereoWorld, an end-to-end framework that repurposes a pretrained video generator for high-fidelity monocular-to-stereo video generation. Our framework jointly conditions the model on the monocular video input while explicitly supervising the generation with a geometry-aware regularization to ensure 3D structural fidelity. A spatio-temporal tiling scheme is further integrated to enable efficient, high-resolution synthesis. To enable large-scale training and evaluation, we curate a high-definition stereo video dataset containing over 11M frames aligned to natural human interpupillary distance (IPD).

TL;DR: ASSIST-3D is a novel 3D scene synthesis pipeline that generates diverse, realistic training data to improve generalization in class-agnostic 3D instance segmentation, outperforming existing methods on major benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class-agnostic 3D instance segmentation struggles with generalization due to scarce annotated 3D data and noisy 2D segmentations. Existing 3D scene synthesis methods fail to simultaneously achieve geometry diversity, context complexity, and layout reasonability needed for effective training data.

Method: ASSIST-3D features three innovations: 1) Heterogeneous Object Selection with random sampling from CAD collections for geometric diversity; 2) Scene Layout Generation using LLM-guided spatial reasoning with depth-first search for reasonable placements; 3) Realistic Point Cloud Construction via multi-view RGB-D rendering and fusion to mimic real sensor data.

Result: Models trained with ASSIST-3D-generated data significantly outperform existing methods on ScanNetV2, ScanNet++, and S3DIS benchmarks. The pipeline also shows superiority over existing 3D scene synthesis approaches.

Conclusion: ASSIST-3D successfully addresses the data scarcity problem in class-agnostic 3D instance segmentation by generating diverse, realistic synthetic training data that enhances model generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Class-agnostic 3D instance segmentation tackles the challenging task of segmenting all object instances, including previously unseen ones, without semantic class reliance. Current methods struggle with generalization due to the scarce annotated 3D scene data or noisy 2D segmentations. While synthetic data generation offers a promising solution, existing 3D scene synthesis methods fail to simultaneously satisfy geometry diversity, context complexity, and layout reasonability, each essential for this task. To address these needs, we propose an Adapted 3D Scene Synthesis pipeline for class-agnostic 3D Instance SegmenTation, termed as ASSIST-3D, to synthesize proper data for model generalization enhancement. Specifically, ASSIST-3D features three key innovations, including 1) Heterogeneous Object Selection from extensive 3D CAD asset collections, incorporating randomness in object sampling to maximize geometric and contextual diversity; 2) Scene Layout Generation through LLM-guided spatial reasoning combined with depth-first search for reasonable object placements; and 3) Realistic Point Cloud Construction via multi-view RGB-D image rendering and fusion from the synthetic scenes, closely mimicking real-world sensor data acquisition. Experiments on ScanNetV2, ScanNet++, and S3DIS benchmarks demonstrate that models trained with ASSIST-3D-generated data significantly outperform existing methods. Further comparisons underscore the superiority of our purpose-built pipeline over existing 3D scene synthesis approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FUSER is a feed-forward multiview registration transformer that directly predicts global poses from all scans without pairwise matching, using superpoint encoding and geometric attention with 2D priors, plus FUSER-DF diffusion refinement for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multiview registration relies on expensive pairwise matching to build pose graphs, which is computationally intensive and ill-posed without holistic geometric constraints.

Method: FUSER encodes scans into low-resolution superpoint features via sparse 3D CNN, performs intra- and inter-scan reasoning through Geometric Alternating Attention module, and transfers 2D attention priors from foundation models. FUSER-DF adds SE(3)^N diffusion refinement using FUSER as a surrogate model for denoising.

Result: Extensive experiments on 3DMatch, ScanNet and ArkitScenes demonstrate superior registration accuracy and outstanding computational efficiency compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: FUSER provides the first feed-forward approach to multiview registration that avoids pairwise matching, achieving both high accuracy and efficiency through unified latent space processing and diffusion-based refinement.

Abstract: Registration of multiview point clouds conventionally relies on extensive pairwise matching to build a pose graph for global synchronization, which is computationally expensive and inherently ill-posed without holistic geometric constraints. This paper proposes FUSER, the first feed-forward multiview registration transformer that jointly processes all scans in a unified, compact latent space to directly predict global poses without any pairwise estimation. To maintain tractability, FUSER encodes each scan into low-resolution superpoint features via a sparse 3D CNN that preserves absolute translation cues, and performs efficient intra- and inter-scan reasoning through a Geometric Alternating Attention module. Particularly, we transfer 2D attention priors from off-the-shelf foundation models to enhance 3D feature interaction and geometric consistency. Building upon FUSER, we further introduce FUSER-DF, an SE(3)$^N$ diffusion refinement framework to correct FUSER's estimates via denoising in the joint SE(3)$^N$ space. FUSER acts as a surrogate multiview registration model to construct the denoiser, and a prior-conditioned SE(3)$^N$ variational lower bound is derived for denoising supervision. Extensive experiments on 3DMatch, ScanNet and ArkitScenes demonstrate that our approach achieves the superior registration accuracy and outstanding computational efficiency.

*Yang Cheng,Ziteng Cui,Lin Gu,Shenghan Su,Zenghui Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel white balance correction framework using a learnable HSI color space with Mamba-based network, outperforming traditional sRGB-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sRGB-based WB editing has limitations due to fixed nonlinear transformations and entangled color channels, which struggle with complex lighting conditions when original camera RAW data is unavailable.

Method: Proposes a perception-inspired Learnable HSI (LHSI) color space based on cylindrical color model that separates luminance from chromatic components, with dedicated parameters for enhanced disentanglement and learnable mapping. Also introduces a new Mamba-based network tailored for this color space.

Result: Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate superiority over existing methods, showing the potential of perception-inspired color space design in computational photography.

Conclusion: The proposed LHSI color space framework with Mamba-based network effectively addresses limitations of traditional sRGB-based WB correction, offering better generalization to complex lighting conditions.

Abstract: White balance (WB) is a key step in the image signal processor (ISP) pipeline that mitigates color casts caused by varying illumination and restores the scene's true colors. Currently, sRGB-based WB editing for post-ISP WB correction is widely used to address color constancy failures in the ISP pipeline when the original camera RAW is unavailable. However, additive color models (e.g., sRGB) are inherently limited by fixed nonlinear transformations and entangled color channels, which often impede their generalization to complex lighting conditions.
  To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework for WB correction that leverages a perception-inspired Learnable HSI (LHSI) color space. Built upon a cylindrical color model that naturally separates luminance from chromatic components, our framework further introduces dedicated parameters to enhance this disentanglement and learnable mapping to adaptively refine the flexibility. Moreover, a new Mamba-based network is introduced, which is tailored to the characteristics of the proposed LHSI color space.
  Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method, highlighting the potential of perception-inspired color space design in computational photography. The source code is available at https://github.com/YangCheng58/WB_Color_Space.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multimodal deep learning framework combining clinical data and CT imaging achieves high accuracy (AUC 0.941) for subdural hematoma detection and localization with interpretable outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subdural hematoma is a common neurosurgical emergency requiring rapid identification. Existing automated tools focus mainly on detection with limited interpretability and spatial localization. There's a need for transparent, high-performing systems that integrate multimodal clinical and imaging information for real-time decision support.

Method: Developed multimodal deep-learning framework integrating: 1) structured clinical variables (demographics, comorbidities, medications, lab results), 2) 3D CNN trained on CT volumes, and 3) transformer-enhanced 2D segmentation model for SDH detection and localization. Used 25,315 head CT studies (3,774 with confirmed SDH). Employed greedy ensemble strategy to combine complementary predictors.

Result: Clinical variables alone: AUC 0.75. Imaging models: 3D CNN AUC 0.922, segmentation model AUC 0.926. Multimodal ensemble achieved best performance: AUC 0.9407 (95% CI 0.930-0.951). Produced anatomically meaningful localization maps consistent with known SDH patterns.

Conclusion: The multimodal, interpretable framework provides rapid and accurate SDH detection and localization with high performance and transparent, anatomically grounded outputs. Integration into radiology workflows could streamline triage, reduce time to intervention, and improve consistency in SDH management.

Abstract: Background. Subdural hematoma (SDH) is a common neurosurgical emergency, with increasing incidence in aging populations. Rapid and accurate identification is essential to guide timely intervention, yet existing automated tools focus primarily on detection and provide limited interpretability or spatial localization. There remains a need for transparent, high-performing systems that integrate multimodal clinical and imaging information to support real-time decision-making.
  Methods. We developed a multimodal deep-learning framework that integrates structured clinical variables, a 3D convolutional neural network trained on CT volumes, and a transformer-enhanced 2D segmentation model for SDH detection and localization. Using 25,315 head CT studies from Hartford HealthCare (2015--2024), of which 3,774 (14.9\%) contained clinician-confirmed SDH, tabular models were trained on demographics, comorbidities, medications, and laboratory results. Imaging models were trained to detect SDH and generate voxel-level probability maps. A greedy ensemble strategy combined complementary predictors.
  Findings. Clinical variables alone provided modest discriminatory power (AUC 0.75). Convolutional models trained on CT volumes and segmentation-derived maps achieved substantially higher accuracy (AUCs 0.922 and 0.926). The multimodal ensemble integrating all components achieved the best overall performance (AUC 0.9407; 95\% CI, 0.930--0.951) and produced anatomically meaningful localization maps consistent with known SDH patterns.
  Interpretation. This multimodal, interpretable framework provides rapid and accurate SDH detection and localization, achieving high detection performance and offering transparent, anatomically grounded outputs. Integration into radiology workflows could streamline triage, reduce time to intervention, and improve consistency in SDH management.

*Rui Wang,Yuting Jiang,Xiaoqing Luo,Xiao-Jun Wu,Nicu Sebe,Ziheng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Wasserstein-Aligned Hyperbolic (WAH) framework for multi-view clustering that addresses limitations of existing hyperbolic methods by incorporating global semantic consistency through hyperbolic sliced-Wasserstein distance alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hyperbolic multi-view clustering methods focus too much on instance-level alignment and neglect global semantic consistency, making them vulnerable to view-specific noise and cross-view discrepancies. There's a need for better handling of both view-common and view-specific information while maintaining semantic consistency across views.

Method: Proposes WAH framework with: 1) View-specific hyperbolic encoders for each view to embed features into Lorentz manifold for hierarchical semantic modeling, 2) Global semantic loss using hyperbolic sliced-Wasserstein distance to align manifold distributions across views, 3) Soft cluster assignments to encourage cross-view semantic consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarking datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) clustering performance.

Conclusion: The WAH framework effectively addresses the limitations of existing hyperbolic multi-view clustering methods by incorporating global semantic alignment through Wasserstein distance, leading to superior clustering performance by better handling both view-common and view-specific information while maintaining semantic consistency.

Abstract: Multi-view clustering (MVC) aims to uncover the latent structure of multi-view data by learning view-common and view-specific information. Although recent studies have explored hyperbolic representations for better tackling the representation gap between different views, they focus primarily on instance-level alignment and neglect global semantic consistency, rendering them vulnerable to view-specific information (\textit{e.g.}, noise and cross-view discrepancies). To this end, this paper proposes a novel Wasserstein-Aligned Hyperbolic (WAH) framework for multi-view clustering. Specifically, our method exploits a view-specific hyperbolic encoder for each view to embed features into the Lorentz manifold for hierarchical semantic modeling. Whereafter, a global semantic loss based on the hyperbolic sliced-Wasserstein distance is introduced to align manifold distributions across views. This is followed by soft cluster assignments to encourage cross-view semantic consistency. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarking datasets show that our method can achieve SOTA clustering performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance 3D registration performance by bridging advanced 2D generative models with 3D matching tasks, addressing the need for better feature matching through geometry-color fusion.

Method: Introduces Match-ControlNet, a controllable 2D generative model that ensures 2D-3D geometric consistency via depth-conditioned ControlNet generation, and promotes cross-view texture consistency through coupled conditional denoising and prompt guidance.

Result: Extensive experiments on 3DMatch and ScanNet datasets verify the effectiveness of the approach, showing enhanced registration performance that can be integrated into various existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed generative 3D registration paradigm successfully bridges 2D generative models with 3D matching, providing a general framework that improves registration performance through geometry-color feature fusion.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel 3D registration paradigm, Generative Point Cloud Registration, which bridges advanced 2D generative models with 3D matching tasks to enhance registration performance. Our key idea is to generate cross-view consistent image pairs that are well-aligned with the source and target point clouds, enabling geometry-color feature fusion to facilitate robust matching. To ensure high-quality matching, the generated image pair should feature both 2D-3D geometric consistency and cross-view texture consistency. To achieve this, we introduce Match-ControlNet, a matching-specific, controllable 2D generative model. Specifically, it leverages the depth-conditioned generation capability of ControlNet to produce images that are geometrically aligned with depth maps derived from point clouds, ensuring 2D-3D geometric consistency. Additionally, by incorporating a coupled conditional denoising scheme and coupled prompt guidance, Match-ControlNet further promotes cross-view feature interaction, guiding texture consistency generation. Our generative 3D registration paradigm is general and could be seamlessly integrated into various registration methods to enhance their performance. Extensive experiments on 3DMatch and ScanNet datasets verify the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DirectSwap: A mask-free video head swapping framework using synthetic paired data and motion-aware losses for better identity fidelity and motion consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video head swapping methods lack ground-truth paired data, rely on mask-based inpainting which causes boundary artifacts, and struggle to recover occluded facial cues like pose, expressions, and motion dynamics.

Method: 1) Create HeadSwapBench dataset using video editing model to synthesize fake swapping inputs with synchronized poses/expressions; 2) DirectSwap framework extends image U-Net to video diffusion with motion module; 3) MEAR loss reweights diffusion loss using frame-difference magnitudes and facial-landmark proximity.

Result: DirectSwap achieves state-of-the-art visual quality, identity fidelity, and motion/expression consistency across diverse in-the-wild video scenes.

Conclusion: The proposed paired dataset and mask-free framework with motion-aware losses significantly improve video head swapping quality, with code and dataset to be released for future research.

Abstract: Video head swapping aims to replace the entire head of a video subject, including facial identity, head shape, and hairstyle, with that of a reference image, while preserving the target body, background, and motion dynamics. Due to the lack of ground-truth paired swapping data, prior methods typically train on cross-frame pairs of the same person within a video and rely on mask-based inpainting to mitigate identity leakage. Beyond potential boundary artifacts, this paradigm struggles to recover essential cues occluded by the mask, such as facial pose, expressions, and motion dynamics. To address these issues, we prompt a video editing model to synthesize new heads for existing videos as fake swapping inputs, while maintaining frame-synchronized facial poses and expressions. This yields HeadSwapBench, the first cross-identity paired dataset for video head swapping, which supports both training (\TrainNum{} videos) and benchmarking (\TestNum{} videos) with genuine outputs. Leveraging this paired supervision, we propose DirectSwap, a mask-free, direct video head-swapping framework that extends an image U-Net into a video diffusion model with a motion module and conditioning inputs. Furthermore, we introduce the Motion- and Expression-Aware Reconstruction (MEAR) loss, which reweights the diffusion loss per pixel using frame-difference magnitudes and facial-landmark proximity, thereby enhancing cross-frame coherence in motion and expressions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectSwap achieves state-of-the-art visual quality, identity fidelity, and motion and expression consistency across diverse in-the-wild video scenes. We will release the source code and the HeadSwapBench dataset to facilitate future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Echocardiography has limited labeled data due to privacy restrictions and complex expert annotation, hindering deep learning applications in cardiac assessment.

Method: Motion Conditioned Diffusion Model (MCDM) with Motion and Appearance Feature Extractor (MAFE) disentangles motion/appearance features, enhanced by re-identification and optical flow losses.

Result: MCDM achieves competitive video generation on EchoNet-Dynamic, producing temporally coherent and clinically realistic sequences without manual labels.

Conclusion: Self-supervised conditioning enables scalable echocardiography synthesis, overcoming data scarcity challenges in cardiac imaging.

Abstract: Ultrasound echocardiography is essential for the non-invasive, real-time assessment of cardiac function, but the scarcity of labelled data, driven by privacy restrictions and the complexity of expert annotation, remains a major obstacle for deep learning methods. We propose the Motion Conditioned Diffusion Model (MCDM), a label-free latent diffusion framework that synthesises realistic echocardiography videos conditioned on self-supervised motion features. To extract these features, we design the Motion and Appearance Feature Extractor (MAFE), which disentangles motion and appearance representations from videos. Feature learning is further enhanced by two auxiliary objectives: a re-identification loss guided by pseudo appearance features and an optical flow loss guided by pseudo flow fields. Evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, MCDM achieves competitive video generation performance, producing temporally coherent and clinically realistic sequences without reliance on manual labels. These results demonstrate the potential of self-supervised conditioning for scalable echocardiography synthesis. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZheLi2020/LabelfreeMCDM.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an effective and scalable solution for medical video dataset distillation, enabling efficient storage, computation, and training while maintaining clinical relevance of echocardiographic data.

Abstract: Echocardiography playing a critical role in the diagnosis and monitoring of cardiovascular diseases as a non-invasive real-time assessment of cardiac structure and function. However, the growing scale of echocardiographic video data presents significant challenges in terms of storage, computation, and model training efficiency. Dataset distillation offers a promising solution by synthesizing a compact, informative subset of data that retains the key clinical features of the original dataset. In this work, we propose a novel approach for distilling a compact synthetic echocardiographic video dataset. Our method leverages motion feature extraction to capture temporal dynamics, followed by class-wise graph construction and representative sample selection using the Infomap algorithm. This enables us to select a diverse and informative subset of synthetic videos that preserves the essential characteristics of the original dataset. We evaluate our approach on the EchoNet-Dynamic datasets and achieve a test accuracy of \(69.38\%\) using only \(25\) synthetic videos. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our method for medical video dataset distillation.

Motivation: Learning natural body motion is challenging due to spatial-temporal coupling. Existing phase manifold approaches lack scalability and are confined to specific settings, limiting their practical application.

Method: Introduces FunPhase, a functional periodic autoencoder that learns phase manifolds for motion and replaces discrete temporal decoding with a function-space formulation, enabling smooth trajectories at arbitrary temporal resolutions.

Result: Achieves substantially lower reconstruction error than prior periodic autoencoder baselines, performs on par with state-of-the-art motion generation methods, and supports downstream tasks like super-resolution and partial-body motion completion.

Conclusion: FunPhase provides a scalable, interpretable manifold that unifies motion prediction and generation, generalizes across skeletons and datasets, and enables a broader range of applications than previous approaches.

Abstract: Learning natural body motion remains challenging due to the strong coupling between spatial geometry and temporal dynamics. Embedding motion in phase manifolds, latent spaces that capture local periodicity, has proven effective for motion prediction; however, existing approaches lack scalability and remain confined to specific settings. We introduce FunPhase, a functional periodic autoencoder that learns a phase manifold for motion and replaces discrete temporal decoding with a function-space formulation, enabling smooth trajectories that can be sampled at arbitrary temporal resolutions. FunPhase supports downstream tasks such as super-resolution and partial-body motion completion, generalizes across skeletons and datasets, and unifies motion prediction and generation within a single interpretable manifold.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniPart is a two-stage latent diffusion framework for image-guided part-level 3D generation that jointly learns geometry and segmentation in a unified representation, enabling better part control and quality than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing part-level 3D generation methods have limitations: they either use implicit part segmentation with poor granularity control, or rely on external segmenters trained on large annotated datasets. The authors observed that part awareness naturally emerges during whole-object geometry learning, suggesting a more integrated approach is possible.

Method: Proposes Geom-Seg VecSet, a unified geometry-segmentation latent representation that jointly encodes object geometry and part-level structure. Then introduces UniPart, a two-stage latent diffusion framework: 1) joint geometry generation and latent part segmentation, 2) part-level diffusion conditioned on both whole-object and part-specific latents. Uses dual-space generation (global and canonical spaces) to enhance geometric fidelity.

Result: Extensive experiments show UniPart achieves superior segmentation controllability and part-level geometric quality compared to existing approaches, demonstrating the effectiveness of the unified representation and two-stage diffusion framework.

Conclusion: The proposed Geom-Seg VecSet representation and UniPart framework successfully address limitations of existing part-level 3D generation methods by naturally integrating part awareness with geometry learning, enabling better control over part granularity and higher quality part-level synthesis without reliance on external segmentation models.

Abstract: Part-level 3D generation is essential for applications requiring decomposable and structured 3D synthesis. However, existing methods either rely on implicit part segmentation with limited granularity control or depend on strong external segmenters trained on large annotated datasets. In this work, we observe that part awareness emerges naturally during whole-object geometry learning and propose Geom-Seg VecSet, a unified geometry-segmentation latent representation that jointly encodes object geometry and part-level structure. Building on this representation, we introduce UniPart, a two-stage latent diffusion framework for image-guided part-level 3D generation. The first stage performs joint geometry generation and latent part segmentation, while the second stage conditions part-level diffusion on both whole-object and part-specific latents. A dual-space generation scheme further enhances geometric fidelity by predicting part latents in both global and canonical spaces. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniPart achieves superior segmentation controllability and part-level geometric quality compared with existing approaches.

*Nadeem Nazer,Hongkuan Zhou,Lavdim Halilaj,Ylli Sadikaj,Steffen Staab*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAPO is a defect-aware prompt optimization method for zero-shot anomaly detection that learns fine-grained defect semantics through hybrid prompts, improving performance under distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs like CLIP neglect fine-grained anomaly details (e.g., "hole", "cut", "scratch") which are crucial for understanding root causes and enabling targeted corrective measures. Handcrafted prompts for each defect type are time-consuming and biased.

Method: DAPO (Defect-aware Prompt Optimization) uses progressive tuning to learn hybrid defect-aware prompts with both fixed textual anchors and learnable token embeddings, aligning anomaly-relevant image features with corresponding text semantics for zero-shot multi-type and binary anomaly detection.

Result: DAPO achieves 3.7% average improvement in AUROC and average precision at image level under distribution shift, and 6.5% average improvement in localizing novel anomaly types under zero-shot settings across multiple benchmarks (MPDD, VisA, MVTec-AD, MAD, Real-IAD).

Conclusion: DAPO effectively captures fine-grained defect semantics through optimized prompts, bridging the gap between coarse anomaly signals and specific defect categories while improving zero-shot anomaly detection performance under distribution shifts.

Abstract: Recent vision language models (VLMs) like CLIP have demonstrated impressive anomaly detection performance under significant distribution shift by utilizing high-level semantic information through text prompts. However, these models often neglect fine-grained details, such as which kind of anomalies, like "hole", "cut", "scratch" that could provide more specific insight into the nature of anomalies. We argue that recognizing fine-grained anomaly types 1) enriches the representation of "abnormal" with structured semantics, narrowing the gap between coarse anomaly signals and fine-grained defect categories; 2) enables manufacturers to understand the root causes of the anomaly and implement more targeted and appropriate corrective measures quickly. While incorporating such detailed semantic information is crucial, designing handcrafted prompts for each defect type is both time-consuming and susceptible to human bias. For this reason, we introduce DAPO, a novel approach for Defect-aware Prompt Optimization based on progressive tuning for the zero-shot multi-type and binary anomaly detection and segmentation under distribution shifts. Our approach aligns anomaly-relevant image features with their corresponding text semantics by learning hybrid defect-aware prompts with both fixed textual anchors and learnable token embeddings. We conducted experiments on public benchmarks (MPDD, VisA, MVTec-AD, MAD, and Real-IAD) and an internal dataset. The results suggest that compared to the baseline models, DAPO achieves a 3.7% average improvement in AUROC and average precision metrics at the image level under distribution shift, and a 6.5% average improvement in localizing novel anomaly types under zero-shot settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB-based aerial object detectors struggle with small objects and background interference due to limited discriminative information. Multispectral images offer additional spectral cues but lack sufficient training data to exploit their potential.

Method: Introduced MODA dataset (14,041 MSIs, 330,191 annotations). Proposed OSSDet framework with cascaded spectral-spatial modulation, spectral similarity aggregation for intra-object correlations, object-aware background suppression, and cross-spectral attention with object-aware guidance.

Result: OSSDet outperforms existing methods with comparable parameters and efficiency. MODA provides comprehensive data foundation for multispectral aerial object detection research.

Conclusion: The MODA dataset addresses the data bottleneck for multispectral aerial object detection, while OSSDet demonstrates effective integration of spectral and spatial information with object-aware cues to overcome challenges in aerial scenarios.

Abstract: Aerial object detection faces significant challenges in real-world scenarios, such as small objects and extensive background interference, which limit the performance of RGB-based detectors with insufficient discriminative information. Multispectral images (MSIs) capture additional spectral cues across multiple bands, offering a promising alternative. However, the lack of training data has been the primary bottleneck to exploiting the potential of MSIs. To address this gap, we introduce the first large-scale dataset for Multispectral Object Detection in Aerial images (MODA), which comprises 14,041 MSIs and 330,191 annotations across diverse, challenging scenarios, providing a comprehensive data foundation for this field. Furthermore, to overcome challenges inherent to aerial object detection using MSIs, we propose OSSDet, a framework that integrates spectral and spatial information with object-aware cues. OSSDet employs a cascaded spectral-spatial modulation structure to optimize target perception, aggregates spectrally related features by exploiting spectral similarities to reinforce intra-object correlations, and suppresses irrelevant background via object-aware masking. Moreover, cross-spectral attention further refines object-related representations under explicit object-aware guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OSSDet outperforms existing methods with comparable parameters and efficiency.

Conclusion: StateSpace-SSL demonstrates the advantage of linear state-space modeling for self-supervised plant disease representation learning, effectively capturing lesion continuity while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is attractive for plant disease detection as it can exploit large collections of unlabeled leaf images, yet most existing SSL methods are built on CNNs or vision transformers that are poorly matched to agricultural imagery. CNN-based SSL struggles to capture disease patterns that evolve continuously along leaf structures, while transformer-based SSL introduces quadratic attention cost from high-resolution patches. To address these limitations, we propose StateSpace-SSL, a linear-time SSL framework that employs a Vision Mamba state-space encoder to model long-range lesion continuity through directional scanning across the leaf surface. A prototype-driven teacher-student objective aligns representations across multiple views, encouraging stable and lesion-aware features from labelled data. Experiments on three publicly available plant disease datasets show that StateSpace-SSL consistently outperforms the CNN- and transformer-based SSL baselines in various evaluation metrics. Qualitative analyses further confirm that it learns compact, lesion-focused feature maps, highlighting the advantage of linear state-space modelling for self-supervised plant disease representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing infrared small target detection methods suffer from inaccurate edge positioning and targets being easily submerged by background due to small target size and lack of intrinsic features.

Method: Proposes GGL-Net with three key components: 1) First to introduce gradient magnitude images into deep learning-based infrared small target detection, 2) Dual-branch feature extraction network with gradient supplementary module (GSM) to encode raw gradient information into deeper layers, 3) Two-way guidance fusion module (TGFM) for effective multi-scale feature fusion.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on both public real NUAA-SIRST dataset and public synthetic NUDT-SIRST dataset.

Conclusion: GGL-Net effectively addresses edge positioning problems in infrared small target detection through gradient guidance and innovative network architecture, demonstrating superior performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Recently, infrared small target detection has attracted extensive attention. However, due to the small size and the lack of intrinsic features of infrared small targets, the existing methods generally have the problem of inaccurate edge positioning and the target is easily submerged by the background. Therefore, we propose an innovative gradient-guided learning network (GGL-Net). Specifically, we are the first to explore the introduction of gradient magnitude images into the deep learning-based infrared small target detection method, which is conducive to emphasizing the edge details and alleviating the problem of inaccurate edge positioning of small targets. On this basis, we propose a novel dual-branch feature extraction network that utilizes the proposed gradient supplementary module (GSM) to encode raw gradient information into deeper network layers and embeds attention mechanisms reasonably to enhance feature extraction ability. In addition, we construct a two-way guidance fusion module (TGFM), which fully considers the characteristics of feature maps at different levels. It can facilitate the effective fusion of multi-scale feature maps and extract richer semantic information and detailed information through reasonable two-way guidance. Extensive experiments prove that GGL-Net has achieves state-of-the-art results on the public real NUAA-SIRST dataset and the public synthetic NUDT-SIRST dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A neural network approach combining spatial transformer networks and autoencoders to predict patient-specific healthy tibia reconstructions from fractured CT scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surgical planning for complex tibial fractures is challenging because surgeons struggle to visualize the 3D structure of the desired bone alignment from fractured CT scans.

Method: Combines neural registration and autoencoder models: 1) Modified spatial transformer network (STN) registers fractured CTs to standardized coordinates, 2) Various autoencoder architectures model healthy tibial variations, 3) Both models are designed to handle masked input for fractured bones.

Result: Developed a system that can predict patient-specific healthy bone structures from fractured CT scans by extending STN and AE models to handle masked inputs for predictive generation.

Conclusion: The approach provides a valuable tool for surgical planning by enabling prediction of patient-specific reconstruction targets from fractured tibia CT scans through robust neural registration and generative modeling techniques.

Abstract: Surgical planning for complex tibial fractures can be challenging for surgeons, as the 3D structure of the later desirable bone alignment may be diffi- cult to imagine. To assist in such planning, we address the challenge of predicting a patient-specific reconstruction target from a CT of the fractured tibia. Our ap- proach combines neural registration and autoencoder models. Specifically, we first train a modified spatial transformer network (STN) to register a raw CT to a standardized coordinate system of a jointly trained tibia prototype. Subsequently, various autoencoder (AE) architectures are trained to model healthy tibial varia- tions. Both the STN and AE models are further designed to be robust to masked input, allowing us to apply them to fractured CTs and decode to a prediction of the patient-specific healthy bone in standard coordinates. Our contributions include: i) a 3D-adapted STN for global spatial registration, ii) a comparative analysis of AEs for bone CT modeling, and iii) the extension of both to handle masked inputs for predictive generation of healthy bone structures.

Method: DDSRNet combines Spatial-Net (shallow feature extraction with residual learning and bilinear interpolation) with DWT-based low-frequency enhancement and shared high-frequency refinement using a single CNN with shared weights for LH, HL, and HH wavelet subbands.

Result: Achieves highly competitive performance with low computational cost on three hyperspectral image datasets, demonstrating effectiveness for hyperspectral image super-resolution.

Conclusion: The integration of spatial- and frequency-domain learning in DDSRNet enables efficient and effective hyperspectral image super-resolution with low computational requirements.

Abstract: This study presents a lightweight dual-domain super-resolution network (DDSRNet) that combines Spatial-Net with the discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Specifically, our proposed model comprises three main components: (1) a shallow feature extraction module, termed Spatial-Net, which performs residual learning and bilinear interpolation; (2) a low-frequency enhancement branch based on the DWT that refines coarse image structures; and (3) a shared high-frequency refinement branch that simultaneously enhances the LH (horizontal), HL (vertical), and HH (diagonal) wavelet subbands using a single CNN with shared weights. As a result, the DWT enables subband decomposition, while the inverse DWT reconstructs the final high-resolution output. By doing so, the integration of spatial- and frequency-domain learning enables DDSRNet to achieve highly competitive performance with low computational cost on three hyperspectral image datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness for hyperspectral image super-resolution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two-stage tuning method for BIQA using VLMs separates visual perception from quality inference to reduce contradictory assessments and improve prediction stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs for BIQA produce contradictory textual descriptions and unstable quality predictions that don't align with human reasoning, with weak logical connections between visual features and final predictions.

Method: Two-stage tuning: first stage learns visual features, second stage infers quality solely from these features. Analyzes relationship between predictions and features, examines token usage in intermediate layers.

Result: Reduces prediction instability from 22.00% to 12.39%, achieves average gains of 0.3124/0.3507 in SRCC/PLCC across four datasets (LIVE, CSIQ, SPAQ, KONIQ). Improves both stability and inference reliability.

Conclusion: Explicitly separating visual perception from quality inference in VLMs leads to more human-like reasoning, reduces contradictions and instability in BIQA predictions.

Abstract: Recent progress in BIQA has been driven by VLMs, whose semantic reasoning abilities suggest that they might extract visual features, generate descriptive text, and infer quality in a human-like manner. However, these models often produce textual descriptions that contradict their final quality predictions, and the predicted scores can change unstably during inference - behaviors not aligned with human reasoning. To understand these issues, we analyze the factors that cause contradictory assessments and instability. We first estimate the relationship between the final quality predictions and the generated visual features, finding that the predictions are not fully grounded in the features and that the logical connection between them is weak. Moreover, decoding intermediate VLM layers shows that the model frequently relies on a limited set of candidate tokens, which contributes to prediction instability. To encourage more human-like reasoning, we introduce a two-stage tuning method that explicitly separates visual perception from quality inference. In the first stage, the model learns visual features; in the second, it infers quality solely from these features. Experiments on SPAQ and KONIQ demonstrate that our approach reduces prediction instability from 22.00% to 12.39% and achieves average gains of 0.3124/0.3507 in SRCC/PLCC across LIVE, CSIQ, SPAQ, and KONIQ compared to the baseline. Further analyses show that our method improves both stability and the reliability of the inference process.

TL;DR: DNS-HyXNet: Lightweight xLSTM framework for real-time DNS tunnel detection with 99.99% accuracy and 0.041ms latency, replacing graph-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph-based DNS tunnel detection methods like GraphTunnel have high latency and computational overhead from recursive parsing and graph construction, making them unsuitable for real-time deployment.

Method: DNS-HyXNet uses a hybrid xLSTM framework integrating tokenized domain embeddings with normalized numerical DNS features, processed through a two-layer xLSTM network for direct temporal dependency learning from packet sequences without graph reconstruction.

Result: Achieved up to 99.99% accuracy, macro-averaged precision/recall/F1-scores exceeding 99.96%, with per-sample detection latency of 0.041 ms on DNS-Tunnel-Datasets benchmarks.

Conclusion: Sequential modeling with xLSTM effectively replaces computationally expensive graph generation, offering a deployable, energy-efficient alternative for real-time DNS tunnel detection on commodity hardware.

Abstract: Domain Name System (DNS) tunneling remains a covert channel for data exfiltration and command-and-control communication. Although graph-based methods such as GraphTunnel achieve strong accuracy, they introduce significant latency and computational overhead due to recursive parsing and graph construction, limiting their suitability for real-time deployment. This work presents DNS-HyXNet, a lightweight extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) hybrid framework designed for efficient sequence-based DNS tunnel detection. DNS-HyXNet integrates tokenized domain embeddings with normalized numerical DNS features and processes them through a two-layer xLSTM network that directly learns temporal dependencies from packet sequences, eliminating the need for graph reconstruction and enabling single-stage multi-class classification. The model was trained and evaluated on two public benchmark datasets with carefully tuned hyperparameters to ensure low memory consumption and fast inference. Across all experimental splits of the DNS-Tunnel-Datasets, DNS-HyXNet achieved up to 99.99% accuracy, with macro-averaged precision, recall, and F1-scores exceeding 99.96%, and demonstrated a per-sample detection latency of just 0.041 ms, confirming its scalability and real-time readiness. These results show that sequential modeling with xLSTM can effectively replace computationally expensive recursive graph generation, offering a deployable and energy-efficient alternative for real-time DNS tunnel detection on commodity hardware.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLM-based IQA systems struggle with low-level distortion detection and produce inconsistent evaluations. Improving vision encoder alignment dramatically enhances distortion recognition from 14.92% to 84.43%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite MLLMs' strong visual perception, they fail to reliably detect basic low-level distortions (blur, noise, compression) and produce inconsistent evaluations, raising questions about whether they truly perceive relevant visual features.

Method: Introduced low-level distortion perception task requiring distortion type classification. Conducted component-wise analysis, examined vision-language alignment transfer, and computed semantic distance between visual features and semantic tokens before/after component-wise fine-tuning.

Result: MLLMs overfit training templates, causing biases in quality scoring and weakening critical low-level features during alignment transfer. Improving vision encoder alignment increased distortion recognition accuracy from 14.92% to 84.43%.

Conclusion: Incorporating dedicated constraints on the vision encoder can strengthen text-explainable visual representations and enable MLLM-based pipelines to produce more coherent and interpretable reasoning in vision-centric tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in Image Quality Assessment (IQA) have leveraged Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate descriptive explanations. However, despite their strong visual perception modules, these models often fail to reliably detect basic low-level distortions such as blur, noise, and compression, and may produce inconsistent evaluations across repeated inferences. This raises an essential question: do MLLM-based IQA systems truly perceive the visual features that matter? To examine this issue, we introduce a low-level distortion perception task that requires models to classify specific distortion types. Our component-wise analysis shows that although MLLMs are structurally capable of representing such distortions, they tend to overfit training templates, leading to biases in quality scoring. As a result, critical low-level features are weakened or lost during the vision-language alignment transfer stage. Furthermore, by computing the semantic distance between visual features and corresponding semantic tokens before and after component-wise fine-tuning, we show that improving the alignment of the vision encoder dramatically enhances distortion recognition accuracy, increasing it from 14.92% to 84.43%. Overall, these findings indicate that incorporating dedicated constraints on the vision encoder can strengthen text-explainable visual representations and enable MLLM-based pipelines to produce more coherent and interpretable reasoning in vision-centric tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Environmental variables increasingly affect agricultural decisions, but accessible, scalable soil assessment tools remain limited. Need for data-driven frameworks that can support applications like carbon markets.

Method: Hybrid modeling approach combining indirect soil modeling through proxies/drivers with direct spectral modeling. Uses interpretable physics-informed covariates from radiative transfer models (RTMs) and nonlinear embeddings from a foundation model. Validated on harmonized European cropland dataset with strict spatial blocking, stratified splits, and statistically distinct train-test sets.

Result: Highest accuracy for SOC (MAE: 5.12 g/kg, CCC: 0.77) and N (MAE: 0.44 g/kg, CCC: 0.77). Performance maintained across unseen locations in spatial cross-validation and independent testing. Uncertainty assessment via conformal calibration achieved 90% coverage at target confidence level.

Conclusion: Contributes to digital agriculture advancement through scalable, data-driven soil analysis frameworks applicable to carbon markets and other domains requiring quantitative soil evaluation. System demonstrates robust performance across diverse pedoclimatic zones.

Abstract: Environmental variables are increasingly affecting agricultural decision-making, yet accessible and scalable tools for soil assessment remain limited. This study presents a robust and scalable modeling system for estimating soil properties in croplands, including soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (N), available phosphorus (P), exchangeable potassium (K), and pH, using remote sensing data and environmental covariates. The system employs a hybrid modeling approach, combining the indirect methods of modeling soil through proxies and drivers with direct spectral modeling. We extend current approaches by using interpretable physics-informed covariates derived from radiative transfer models (RTMs) and complex, nonlinear embeddings from a foundation model. We validate the system on a harmonized dataset that covers Europes cropland soils across diverse pedoclimatic zones. Evaluation is conducted under a robust validation framework that enforces strict spatial blocking, stratified splits, and statistically distinct train-test sets, which deliberately make the evaluation harder and produce more realistic error estimates for unseen regions. The models achieved their highest accuracy for SOC and N. This performance held across unseen locations, under both spatial cross-validation and an independent test set. SOC obtained a MAE of 5.12 g/kg and a CCC of 0.77, and N obtained a MAE of 0.44 g/kg and a CCC of 0.77. We also assess uncertainty through conformal calibration, achieving 90 percent coverage at the target confidence level. This study contributes to the digital advancement of agriculture through the application of scalable, data-driven soil analysis frameworks that can be extended to related domains requiring quantitative soil evaluation, such as carbon markets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CA-ATP: Content-Adaptive image retouching with Attribute-based Text Representation that enables adaptive color mapping based on image content and user style preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image retouching methods use uniform pixel-wise color mapping across entire images, ignoring inherent color variations from image content. This prevents adaptive retouching that accommodates diverse color distributions and user-defined style preferences.

Method: Proposes CA-ATP with two modules: 1) Content-adaptive curve mapping module using basis curves to establish multiple color mapping relationships with learned weight maps for content-aware adjustments, and 2) Attribute text prediction module that generates text representations from image attributes to represent user style preferences, integrated with visual features via multimodal model.

Result: Extensive experiments on several public datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: CA-ATP addresses limitations of existing approaches by enabling content-aware color adjustments and user-friendly style guidance through attribute-based text representations, achieving superior retouching performance.

Abstract: Image retouching has received significant attention due to its ability to achieve high-quality visual content. Existing approaches mainly rely on uniform pixel-wise color mapping across entire images, neglecting the inherent color variations induced by image content. This limitation hinders existing approaches from achieving adaptive retouching that accommodates both diverse color distributions and user-defined style preferences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Content-Adaptive image retouching method guided by Attribute-based Text Representation (CA-ATP). Specifically, we propose a content-adaptive curve mapping module, which leverages a series of basis curves to establish multiple color mapping relationships and learns the corresponding weight maps, enabling content-aware color adjustments. The proposed module can capture color diversity within the image content, allowing similar color values to receive distinct transformations based on their spatial context. In addition, we propose an attribute text prediction module that generates text representations from multiple image attributes, which explicitly represent user-defined style preferences. These attribute-based text representations are subsequently integrated with visual features via a multimodal model, providing user-friendly guidance for image retouching. Extensive experiments on several public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Specular highlights distort appearance, obscure texture, and hinder geometric reasoning in both natural and surgical imagery, creating challenges for computer vision tasks.

Method: Uses frozen vision transformer encoder for multi-scale features, lightweight head for highlight localization, and token-level inpainting module. Introduces Virtual Highlight Synthesis pipeline with monocular geometry, Fresnel-aware shading, and randomized lighting for training on arbitrary RGB images.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks, generalizing across natural and surgical domains despite severe highlights from non-Lambertian surfaces and non-uniform lighting.

Conclusion: UnReflectAnything provides an effective RGB-only solution for highlight removal that works across diverse domains without requiring paired training data, enabling better texture analysis and geometric reasoning.

Abstract: Specular highlights distort appearance, obscure texture, and hinder geometric reasoning in both natural and surgical imagery. We present UnReflectAnything, an RGB-only framework that removes highlights from a single image by predicting a highlight map together with a reflection-free diffuse reconstruction. The model uses a frozen vision transformer encoder to extract multi-scale features, a lightweight head to localize specular regions, and a token-level inpainting module that restores corrupted feature patches before producing the final diffuse image. To overcome the lack of paired supervision, we introduce a Virtual Highlight Synthesis pipeline that renders physically plausible specularities using monocular geometry, Fresnel-aware shading, and randomized lighting which enables training on arbitrary RGB images with correct geometric structure. UnReflectAnything generalizes across natural and surgical domains where non-Lambertian surfaces and non-uniform lighting create severe highlights and it achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lightweight adaptation technique for appearance transfer in multiview diffusion models that learns to combine object identity from input images with appearance cues from reference images while maintaining multi-view consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multiview diffusion models offer rich visual realism but limited appearance manipulation capabilities (material, texture, style) compared to explicit 3D representations like meshes or radiance fields.

Method: Uses three diffusion denoising processes (object, reference, target) with reverse sampling to aggregate layer-wise self-attention features from object and reference to influence target generation. Requires minimal training examples to add appearance awareness to pretrained models.

Result: Enables explicit specification of appearance parameters at generation time while preserving object geometry and view coherence, providing effective multiview generation with diverse appearance.

Conclusion: Presents a simple yet effective approach for appearance transfer in multiview diffusion models, advocating for implicit generative 3D representations in practical applications.

Abstract: Multiview diffusion models have rapidly emerged as a powerful tool for content creation with spatial consistency across viewpoints, offering rich visual realism without requiring explicit geometry and appearance representation. However, compared to meshes or radiance fields, existing multiview diffusion models offer limited appearance manipulation, particularly in terms of material, texture, or style.
  In this paper, we present a lightweight adaptation technique for appearance transfer in multiview diffusion models. Our method learns to combine object identity from an input image with appearance cues rendered in a separate reference image, producing multi-view-consistent output that reflects the desired materials, textures, or styles. This allows explicit specification of appearance parameters at generation time while preserving the underlying object geometry and view coherence. We leverage three diffusion denoising processes responsible for generating the original object, the reference, and the target images, and perform reverse sampling to aggregate a small subset of layer-wise self-attention features from the object and the reference to influence the target generation. Our method requires only a few training examples to introduce appearance awareness to pretrained multiview models. The experiments show that our method provides a simple yet effective way toward multiview generation with diverse appearance, advocating the adoption of implicit generative 3D representations in practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliably predicting human intent in hand-object interactions is an open challenge in computer vision, requiring better understanding of atomic interaction states.

Method: Developed structured data engineering to convert MANIAC dataset videos into 27,476 statistical-kinematic feature vectors. Compared static classifiers (MLPs) vs temporal models (RNNs), with key innovation being Bidirectional RNN with seq_length=1 acting as static feature encoder.

Result: Achieved 97.60% accuracy with optimized model, successfully overcoming the challenging 'grabbing' transitional class with balanced F1-score of 0.90.

Conclusion: Provides new benchmark for low-level hand-object interaction recognition using structured, interpretable features and lightweight architectures, with counter-intuitive finding that high-capacity static encoding outperforms sequential modeling.

Abstract: Reliably predicting human intent in hand-object interactions is an open challenge for computer vision. Our research concentrates on a fundamental sub-problem: the fine-grained classification of atomic interaction states, namely 'approaching', 'grabbing', and 'holding'. To this end, we introduce a structured data engineering process that converts raw videos from the MANIAC dataset into 27,476 statistical-kinematic feature vectors. Each vector encapsulates relational and dynamic properties from a short temporal window of motion. Our initial hypothesis posited that sequential modeling would be critical, leading us to compare static classifiers (MLPs) against temporal models (RNNs). Counter-intuitively, the key discovery occurred when we set the sequence length of a Bidirectional RNN to one (seq_length=1). This modification converted the network's function, compelling it to act as a high-capacity static feature encoder. This architectural change directly led to a significant accuracy improvement, culminating in a final score of 97.60%. Of particular note, our optimized model successfully overcame the most challenging transitional class, 'grabbing', by achieving a balanced F1-score of 0.90. These findings provide a new benchmark for low-level hand-object interaction recognition using structured, interpretable features and lightweight architectures.

Conclusion: Kaapana successfully bridges the gap between the need for large, multi-center datasets in medical imaging research and the practical challenges of regulatory constraints and fragmented infrastructure, providing a standardized, reproducible platform for collaborative AI development in healthcare.

Abstract: Developing generalizable AI for medical imaging requires both access to large, multi-center datasets and standardized, reproducible tooling within research environments. However, leveraging real-world imaging data in clinical research environments is still hampered by strict regulatory constraints, fragmented software infrastructure, and the challenges inherent in conducting large-cohort multicentre studies. This leads to projects that rely on ad-hoc toolchains that are hard to reproduce, difficult to scale beyond single institutions and poorly suited for collaboration between clinicians and data scientists. We present Kaapana, a comprehensive open-source platform for medical imaging research that is designed to bridge this gap. Rather than building single-use, site-specific tooling, Kaapana provides a modular, extensible framework that unifies data ingestion, cohort curation, processing workflows and result inspection under a common user interface. By bringing the algorithm to the data, it enables institutions to keep control over their sensitive data while still participating in distributed experimentation and model development. By integrating flexible workflow orchestration with user-facing applications for researchers, Kaapana reduces technical overhead, improves reproducibility and enables conducting large-scale, collaborative, multi-centre imaging studies. We describe the core concepts of the platform and illustrate how they can support diverse use cases, from local prototyping to nation-wide research networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing controllable video generation approaches face a trade-off between sparse controls (easy to specify but lack instance-awareness) and dense signals (informative but costly to obtain). Realistic human-object interaction synthesis is challenging due to complex, instance-specific dynamics.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Densify sparse trajectories into HOI mask sequences, 2) Fine-tune a video diffusion model conditioned on these dense masks using novel HOI-aware motion representation with color encodings to distinguish human, object, and body-part-specific dynamics.

Result: State-of-the-art results in controllable HOI video generation. The method can generate not only interaction-only scenarios but also full human navigation leading up to object interactions end-to-end.

Conclusion: VHOI successfully addresses the controllability trade-off in HOI video generation by introducing HOI-aware motion representations that incorporate human priors, enabling realistic and controllable synthesis of complex human-object interactions.

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic human-object interactions (HOI) in video is challenging due to the complex, instance-specific interaction dynamics of both humans and objects. Incorporating controllability in video generation further adds to the complexity. Existing controllable video generation approaches face a trade-off: sparse controls like keypoint trajectories are easy to specify but lack instance-awareness, while dense signals such as optical flow, depths or 3D meshes are informative but costly to obtain. We propose VHOI, a two-stage framework that first densifies sparse trajectories into HOI mask sequences, and then fine-tunes a video diffusion model conditioned on these dense masks. We introduce a novel HOI-aware motion representation that uses color encodings to distinguish not only human and object motion, but also body-part-specific dynamics. This design incorporates a human prior into the conditioning signal and strengthens the model's ability to understand and generate realistic HOI dynamics. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results in controllable HOI video generation. VHOI is not limited to interaction-only scenarios and can also generate full human navigation leading up to object interactions in an end-to-end manner.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address fair classification in scarce, unbalanced data settings common in medical imaging where false negatives can be fatal, requiring methods that work in low-data regimes.

Method: Proposes OxEnsemble which trains ensembles where each member satisfies fairness constraints, aggregates predictions across members, carefully reuses held-out data for fairness enforcement, and is compute-efficient.

Result: Provides theoretical guarantees and experimental validation showing more consistent outcomes and stronger fairness-accuracy trade-offs than existing methods across multiple medical imaging datasets.

Conclusion: OxEnsemble offers an efficient solution for fair classification in low-data medical domains, balancing fairness constraints with computational efficiency while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: We address the problem of fair classification in settings where data is scarce and unbalanced across demographic groups. Such low-data regimes are common in domains like medical imaging, where false negatives can have fatal consequences.
  We propose a novel approach \emph{OxEnsemble} for efficiently training ensembles and enforcing fairness in these low-data regimes. Unlike other approaches, we aggregate predictions across ensemble members, each trained to satisfy fairness constraints. By construction, \emph{OxEnsemble} is both data-efficient, carefully reusing held-out data to enforce fairness reliably, and compute-efficient, requiring little more compute than used to fine-tune or evaluate an existing model. We validate this approach with new theoretical guarantees. Experimentally, our approach yields more consistent outcomes and stronger fairness-accuracy trade-offs than existing methods across multiple challenging medical imaging classification datasets.

Conclusion: The framework is extensible to broader applications like smart-city monitoring and disaster response where timely tasking and automated analysis are critical, providing an effective solution for automated Earth observation systems.

Abstract: The proliferation of satellite constellations, coupled with reduced tasking latency and diverse sensor capabilities, has expanded the opportunities for automated Earth observation. This paper introduces a fully automated Tip-and-Cue framework designed for satellite imaging tasking and scheduling. In this context, tips are generated from external data sources or analyses of prior satellite imagery, identifying spatiotemporal targets and prioritizing them for downstream planning. Corresponding cues are the imaging tasks formulated in response, which incorporate sensor constraints, timing requirements, and utility functions. The system autonomously generates candidate tasks, optimizes their scheduling across multiple satellites using continuous utility functions that reflect the expected value of each observation, and processes the resulting imagery using artificial-intelligence-based models, including object detectors and vision-language models. Structured visual reports are generated to support both interpretability and the identification of new insights for downstream tasking. The efficacy of the framework is demonstrated through a maritime vessel tracking scenario, utilizing Automatic Identification System (AIS) data for trajectory prediction, targeted observations, and the generation of actionable outputs. Maritime vessel tracking is a widely researched application, often used to benchmark novel approaches to satellite tasking, forecasting, and analysis. The system is extensible to broader applications such as smart-city monitoring and disaster response, where timely tasking and automated analysis are critical.

*Er Jin,Yang Zhang,Yongli Mou,Yanfei Dong,Stefan Decker,Kenji Kawaguchi,Johannes Stegmaier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniForget uses model pruning to suppress copyrighted content generation in diffusion models without targeting specific concepts, preserving general generative capabilities while being complementary to existing unlearning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models increasingly memorize training data, leading to legal risks like copyright infringement. Existing methods are computationally expensive or narrowly focused on specific concepts, lacking scalability.

Method: Identifies specific model parts responsible for copyrighted content generation and applies model pruning to suppress this capability without targeting specific concepts, preserving general generative performance.

Result: Effectively reduces probability of generating copyrighted content while maintaining model's general generative capabilities, and demonstrates orthogonality/complementarity with existing unlearning methods.

Conclusion: UniForget provides a scalable, concept-agnostic approach to mitigate memorization through targeted pruning, offering a new perspective that can enhance current unlearning and de-memorization techniques.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have demonstrated an exceptional ability to produce highly realistic images. However, previous studies show that generated images often resemble the training data, and this problem becomes more severe as the model size increases. Memorizing training data can lead to legal challenges, including copyright infringement, violations of portrait rights, and trademark violations. Existing approaches to mitigating memorization mainly focus on manipulating the denoising sampling process to steer image embeddings away from the memorized embedding space or employ unlearning methods that require training on datasets containing specific sets of memorized concepts. However, existing methods often incur substantial computational overhead during sampling, or focus narrowly on removing one or more groups of target concepts, imposing a significant limitation on their scalability. To understand and mitigate these problems, our work, UniForget, offers a new perspective on understanding the root cause of memorization. Our work demonstrates that specific parts of the model are responsible for copyrighted content generation. By applying model pruning, we can effectively suppress the probability of generating copyrighted content without targeting specific concepts while preserving the general generative capabilities of the model. Additionally, we show that our approach is both orthogonal and complementary to existing unlearning methods, thereby highlighting its potential to improve current unlearning and de-memorization techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiM-YOLO is a specialized ship detector for satellite imagery that addresses scale disparity and morphological anisotropy by shifting detection heads to P2-P4 pyramid levels and using GN-CBLinear for stable training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose object detectors struggle with ship detection in satellite imagery due to extreme scale differences and anisotropic shapes of maritime targets. Standard architectures with stride-32 layers fail to resolve narrow vessels, causing spatial feature dilution.

Method: Based on statistical analysis of ship scales, the authors propose: 1) Pyramid Level Shift Strategy that reconfigures detection heads to P2-P4 layers to meet Nyquist sampling criteria for small objects while reducing computational redundancy, and 2) Group Normalized Convolutional Block for Linear Projection (GN-CBLinear) to enhance training stability on high-resolution inputs in micro-batch settings.

Result: LiM-YOLO demonstrates superior detection accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art models when validated on SODA-A, DOTA-v1.5, FAIR1M-v2.0, and ShipRSImageNet-V1 datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed LiM-YOLO effectively addresses domain-specific challenges in ship detection from satellite imagery through pyramid level reconfiguration and stable training mechanisms, achieving better performance than existing methods.

Abstract: Applying general-purpose object detectors to ship detection in satellite imagery presents significant challenges due to the extreme scale disparity and morphological anisotropy of maritime targets. Standard architectures utilizing stride-32 (P5) layers often fail to resolve narrow vessels, resulting in spatial feature dilution. In this work, we propose LiM-YOLO, a specialized detector designed to resolve these domain-specific conflicts. Based on a statistical analysis of ship scales, we introduce a Pyramid Level Shift Strategy that reconfigures the detection head to P2-P4. This shift ensures compliance with Nyquist sampling criteria for small objects while eliminating the computational redundancy of deep layers. To further enhance training stability on high-resolution inputs, we incorporate a Group Normalized Convolutional Block for Linear Projection (GN-CBLinear), which mitigates gradient volatility in micro-batch settings. Validated on SODA-A, DOTA-v1.5, FAIR1M-v2.0, and ShipRSImageNet-V1, LiM-YOLO demonstrates superior detection accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stylized Meta-Album (SMA) is a new image classification meta-dataset with 24 datasets (12 content + 12 stylized) for studying OOD generalization, offering flexible control over groups/classes to simulate diverse real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the practical limitations of collecting data with extensive group diversity, and to enable more comprehensive studies on out-of-distribution generalization, fairness, robustness, and domain adaptation under realistic conditions with configurable group structures.

Method: Created using style transfer techniques on 12 subject classification datasets, resulting in 4800 groups combining various subjects (objects, plants, animals, etc.) with multiple styles. Provides flexible control over styles, subject classes, and domains to configure datasets for diverse benchmark scenarios.

Result: Demonstrated SMA's effectiveness through two benchmarks: (1) OOD generalization/fairness benchmark showing increased group diversity significantly impacts fairness and alters algorithm rankings, and proposed Top-M worst group accuracy as a new tuning metric; (2) UDA benchmark with 73% and 28% lower error bars in closed-set and UniDA settings respectively.

Conclusion: SMA enables more comprehensive evaluation of models across diverse group and domain configurations, significantly impacting conventional benchmark outcomes and opening new methodological directions for studying fairness, robustness, and adaptation under realistic conditions.

Abstract: We introduce Stylized Meta-Album (SMA), a new image classification meta-dataset comprising 24 datasets (12 content datasets, and 12 stylized datasets), designed to advance studies on out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization and related topics. Created using style transfer techniques from 12 subject classification datasets, SMA provides a diverse and extensive set of 4800 groups, combining various subjects (objects, plants, animals, human actions, textures) with multiple styles. SMA enables flexible control over groups and classes, allowing us to configure datasets to reflect diverse benchmark scenarios. While ideally, data collection would capture extensive group diversity, practical constraints often make this infeasible. SMA addresses this by enabling large and configurable group structures through flexible control over styles, subject classes, and domains-allowing datasets to reflect a wide range of real-world benchmark scenarios. This design not only expands group and class diversity, but also opens new methodological directions for evaluating model performance across diverse group and domain configurations-including scenarios with many minority groups, varying group imbalance, and complex domain shifts-and for studying fairness, robustness, and adaptation under a broader range of realistic conditions. To demonstrate SMA's effectiveness, we implemented two benchmarks: (1) a novel OOD generalization and group fairness benchmark leveraging SMA's domain, class, and group diversity to evaluate existing benchmarks. Our findings reveal that while simple balancing and algorithms utilizing group information remain competitive as claimed in previous benchmarks, increasing group diversity significantly impacts fairness, altering the superiority and relative rankings of algorithms. We also propose to use \textit{Top-M worst group accuracy} as a new hyperparameter tuning metric, demonstrating broader fairness during optimization and delivering better final worst-group accuracy for larger group diversity. (2) An unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) benchmark utilizing SMA's group diversity to evaluate UDA algorithms across more scenarios, offering a more comprehensive benchmark with lower error bars (reduced by 73\% and 28\% in closed-set setting and UniDA setting, respectively) compared to existing efforts. These use cases highlight SMA's potential to significantly impact the outcomes of conventional benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastPose-ViT: A Vision Transformer-based method for real-time 6DoF spacecraft pose estimation that directly regresses pose without iterative PnP, achieving ~75ms latency on edge hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spacecraft pose estimation methods rely on computationally intensive iterative PnP algorithms that are unsuitable for real-time deployment on resource-constrained edge devices needed for autonomous space operations.

Method: Proposes FastPose-ViT, a Vision Transformer architecture that directly regresses 6DoF pose from cropped object bounding boxes. Introduces novel mathematical formalism based on projective geometry and "apparent rotation" concept to map localized predictions back to full-image scale.

Result: Outperforms other non-PnP strategies and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art PnP-based techniques on SPEED dataset. When quantized and deployed on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, achieves ~75ms latency per frame sequentially and up to 33 FPS throughput with concurrent scheduling.

Conclusion: FastPose-ViT provides an efficient, real-time solution for spacecraft pose estimation suitable for deployment on power-constrained edge hardware, enabling autonomous space operations like in-orbit servicing and debris removal.

Abstract: Estimating the 6-degrees-of-freedom (6DoF) pose of a spacecraft from a single image is critical for autonomous operations like in-orbit servicing and space debris removal. Existing state-of-the-art methods often rely on iterative Perspective-n-Point (PnP)-based algorithms, which are computationally intensive and ill-suited for real-time deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. To overcome these limitations, we propose FastPose-ViT, a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architecture that directly regresses the 6DoF pose. Our approach processes cropped images from object bounding boxes and introduces a novel mathematical formalism to map these localized predictions back to the full-image scale. This formalism is derived from the principles of projective geometry and the concept of "apparent rotation", where the model predicts an apparent rotation matrix that is then corrected to find the true orientation. We demonstrate that our method outperforms other non-PnP strategies and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art PnP-based techniques on the SPEED dataset. Furthermore, we validate our model's suitability for real-world space missions by quantizing it and deploying it on power-constrained edge hardware. On the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, our end-to-end pipeline achieves a latency of ~75 ms per frame under sequential execution, and a non-blocking throughput of up to 33 FPS when stages are scheduled concurrently.

TL;DR: Novel semi-supervised multi-modal medical image segmentation framework with modality-specific enhancing and adaptive cross-modal fusion modules that outperforms baselines on BraTS 2019 with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSL approaches for multi-modal medical imaging struggle to exploit complementary information between modalities due to semantic discrepancies and misalignment across MRI sequences, limiting their effectiveness with scarce labeled data.

Method: Proposes a semi-supervised multi-modal framework with two key components: 1) Modality-specific Enhancing Module (MEM) using channel-wise attention to strengthen unique semantic cues per modality, and 2) Complementary Information Fusion (CIF) module for adaptive cross-modal knowledge exchange. Uses hybrid objective combining supervised segmentation loss and cross-modal consistency regularization.

Result: Outperforms strong semi-supervised and multi-modal baselines on BraTS 2019 (HGG subset) under 1%, 5%, and 10% labeled data settings, achieving significant improvements in both Dice and Sensitivity scores. Ablation studies confirm complementary effects of MEM and CIF.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively bridges cross-modality discrepancies and improves segmentation robustness under scarce supervision by enhancing modality-specific representations and facilitating adaptive cross-modal information fusion.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has become a promising direction for medical image segmentation, enabling models to learn from limited labeled data alongside abundant unlabeled samples. However, existing SSL approaches for multi-modal medical imaging often struggle to exploit the complementary information between modalities due to semantic discrepancies and misalignment across MRI sequences. To address this, we propose a novel semi-supervised multi-modal framework that explicitly enhances modality-specific representations and facilitates adaptive cross-modal information fusion. Specifically, we introduce a Modality-specific Enhancing Module (MEM) to strengthen semantic cues unique to each modality via channel-wise attention, and a learnable Complementary Information Fusion (CIF) module to adaptively exchange complementary knowledge between modalities. The overall framework is optimized using a hybrid objective combining supervised segmentation loss and cross-modal consistency regularization on unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2019 (HGG subset) demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong semi-supervised and multi-modal baselines under 1\%, 5\%, and 10\% labeled data settings, achieving significant improvements in both Dice and Sensitivity scores. Ablation studies further confirm the complementary effects of our proposed MEM and CIF in bridging cross-modality discrepancies and improving segmentation robustness under scarce supervision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DynaIP is a new plugin for personalized text-to-image generation that improves concept preservation, prompt following, and multi-subject scalability without test-time fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PT2I methods struggle with balancing concept preservation vs prompt following, retaining fine-grained details, and scaling to multi-subject personalization.

Method: Dynamic Decoupling Strategy removes concept-agnostic interference, and Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts Feature Fusion leverages CLIP's hierarchical features for better visual granularity control.

Result: Extensive experiments show DynaIP outperforms existing approaches in single- and multi-subject PT2I tasks.

Conclusion: DynaIP represents a notable advancement in PT2I generation by enhancing fine-grained concept fidelity, CP-PF balance, and subject scalability.

Abstract: Personalized Text-to-Image (PT2I) generation aims to produce customized images based on reference images. A prominent interest pertains to the integration of an image prompt adapter to facilitate zero-shot PT2I without test-time fine-tuning. However, current methods grapple with three fundamental challenges: 1. the elusive equilibrium between Concept Preservation (CP) and Prompt Following (PF), 2. the difficulty in retaining fine-grained concept details in reference images, and 3. the restricted scalability to extend to multi-subject personalization. To tackle these challenges, we present Dynamic Image Prompt Adapter (DynaIP), a cutting-edge plugin to enhance the fine-grained concept fidelity, CP-PF balance, and subject scalability of SOTA T2I multimodal diffusion transformers (MM-DiT) for PT2I generation. Our key finding is that MM-DiT inherently exhibit decoupling learning behavior when injecting reference image features into its dual branches via cross attentions. Based on this, we design an innovative Dynamic Decoupling Strategy that removes the interference of concept-agnostic information during inference, significantly enhancing the CP-PF balance and further bolstering the scalability of multi-subject compositions. Moreover, we identify the visual encoder as a key factor affecting fine-grained CP and reveal that the hierarchical features of commonly used CLIP can capture visual information at diverse granularity levels. Therefore, we introduce a novel Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts Feature Fusion Module to fully leverage the hierarchical features of CLIP, remarkably elevating the fine-grained concept fidelity while also providing flexible control of visual granularity. Extensive experiments across single- and multi-subject PT2I tasks verify that our DynaIP outperforms existing approaches, marking a notable advancement in the field of PT2l generation.

TL;DR: Online struggle detection and anticipation for real-time assistive systems, achieving 70-80% mAP for detection and comparable performance for 2-second anticipation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time assistive systems need to identify user difficulties (struggle) online rather than offline, requiring models that can detect and anticipate struggle moments as they occur or before they happen.

Method: Reformulate struggle localization as online detection task, extend to anticipation, adapt two off-the-shelf models as baselines for online struggle detection and anticipation, examine generalization across tasks/activities and skill evolution impact.

Result: Online struggle detection achieves 70-80% per-frame mAP; struggle anticipation up to 2 seconds ahead yields comparable performance with slight drops. Models generalize across tasks/activities, outperforming random baselines by 4-20% despite domain gaps. Feature-based models run at 143 FPS, whole pipeline at ~20 FPS.

Conclusion: The proposed online struggle detection and anticipation approach is effective for real-time assistive applications, with good performance, generalization capability, and sufficient processing speed for practical deployment.

Abstract: Understanding human skill performance is essential for intelligent assistive systems, with struggle recognition offering a natural cue for identifying user difficulties. While prior work focuses on offline struggle classification and localization, real-time applications require models capable of detecting and anticipating struggle online. We reformulate struggle localization as an online detection task and further extend it to anticipation, predicting struggle moments before they occur. We adapt two off-the-shelf models as baselines for online struggle detection and anticipation. Online struggle detection achieves 70-80% per-frame mAP, while struggle anticipation up to 2 seconds ahead yields comparable performance with slight drops. We further examine generalization across tasks and activities and analyse the impact of skill evolution. Despite larger domain gaps in activity-level generalization, models still outperform random baselines by 4-20%. Our feature-based models run at up to 143 FPS, and the whole pipeline, including feature extraction, operates at around 20 FPS, sufficient for real-time assistive applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving systems struggle with long-tail scenarios due to limited world knowledge and weak visual dynamic modeling.

Conclusion: UniUGP effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by integrating visual dynamics, semantic reasoning, and planning capabilities, demonstrating strong performance in complex autonomous driving scenarios.

Abstract: Autonomous driving (AD) systems struggle in long-tail scenarios due to limited world knowledge and weak visual dynamic modeling. Existing vision-language-action (VLA)-based methods cannot leverage unlabeled videos for visual causal learning, while world model-based methods lack reasoning capabilities from large language models. In this paper, we construct multiple specialized datasets providing reasoning and planning annotations for complex scenarios. Then, a unified Understanding-Generation-Planning framework, named UniUGP, is proposed to synergize scene reasoning, future video generation, and trajectory planning through a hybrid expert architecture. By integrating pre-trained VLMs and video generation models, UniUGP leverages visual dynamics and semantic reasoning to enhance planning performance. Taking multi-frame observations and language instructions as input, it produces interpretable chain-of-thought reasoning, physically consistent trajectories, and coherent future videos. We introduce a four-stage training strategy that progressively builds these capabilities across multiple existing AD datasets, along with the proposed specialized datasets. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in perception, reasoning, and decision-making, with superior generalization to challenging long-tail situations.

*Yimin Zhu,Lincoln Linlin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DPS4Un: A diffusion posterior sampler for semiblind hyperspectral unmixing that uses superpixel-based endmember bundles and data consistency constraints to address spectral variability and prior modeling challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear spectral mixture models need to address spectral variability and prior distribution modeling. Bayesian frameworks can combine observed data with endmember priors, but existing spectral libraries may introduce bias. There's a need for better methods to model spectral priors and handle variability in real-world hyperspectral unmixing.

Method: Proposes DPS4Un: (1) Uses pretrained conditional spectrum diffusion model as posterior sampler to combine learned endmember prior with observations; (2) Establishes image-based endmember bundles within superpixels instead of spectral libraries; (3) Implements superpixel-based data fidelity term rather than image-level constraints; (4) Initializes endmembers as Gaussian noise per superpixel and iteratively updates abundance and endmembers.

Result: Experimental results on three real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that DPS4Un outperforms state-of-the-art hyperspectral unmixing methods.

Conclusion: DPS4Un effectively addresses spectral variability and prior modeling challenges in hyperspectral unmixing through diffusion-based posterior sampling and superpixel-based approaches, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Linear spectral mixture models (LMM) provide a concise form to disentangle the constituent materials (endmembers) and their corresponding proportions (abundance) in a single pixel. The critical challenges are how to model the spectral prior distribution and spectral variability. Prior knowledge and spectral variability can be rigorously modeled under the Bayesian framework, where posterior estimation of Abundance is derived by combining observed data with endmember prior distribution. Considering the key challenges and the advantages of the Bayesian framework, a novel method using a diffusion posterior sampler for semiblind unmixing, denoted as DPS4Un, is proposed to deal with these challenges with the following features: (1) we view the pretrained conditional spectrum diffusion model as a posterior sampler, which can combine the learned endmember prior with observation to get the refined abundance distribution. (2) Instead of using the existing spectral library as prior, which may raise bias, we establish the image-based endmember bundles within superpixels, which are used to train the endmember prior learner with diffusion model. Superpixels make sure the sub-scene is more homogeneous. (3) Instead of using the image-level data consistency constraint, the superpixel-based data fidelity term is proposed. (4) The endmember is initialized as Gaussian noise for each superpixel region, DPS4Un iteratively updates the abundance and endmember, contributing to spectral variability modeling. The experimental results on three real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that DPS4Un outperforms the state-of-the-art hyperspectral unmixing methods.

Method: Created synthetic PDFs with precise LaTeX ground truth for systematic control, developed LLM-as-a-judge for semantic formula assessment with two-stage matching pipeline, and evaluated 20+ PDF parsers on 100 synthetic documents with 2,000+ formulas.

Result: LLM-based evaluation achieved substantially higher correlation with human judgment (Pearson r=0.78) compared to CDM (r=0.34) and text similarity (r~0), revealing significant performance disparities among contemporary PDF parsers.

Conclusion: The framework provides crucial insights for parser selection and establishes a robust, scalable methodology for reproducible evaluation of PDF formula extraction quality, addressing a critical gap in scientific document processing.

Abstract: Correctly parsing mathematical formulas from PDFs is critical for training large language models and building scientific knowledge bases from academic literature, yet existing benchmarks either exclude formulas entirely or lack semantically-aware evaluation metrics. We introduce a novel benchmarking framework centered on synthetically generated PDFs with precise LaTeX ground truth, enabling systematic control over layout, formulas, and content characteristics. A key methodological contribution is pioneering LLM-as-a-judge for semantic formula assessment, combined with a robust two-stage matching pipeline that handles parser output inconsistencies. Through human validation on 250 formula pairs (750 ratings from 30 evaluators), we demonstrate that LLM-based evaluation achieves substantially higher correlation with human judgment (Pearson r=0.78) compared to CDM (r=0.34) and text similarity (r~0). Evaluating 20+ contemporary PDF parsers (including specialized OCR models, vision-language models, and rule-based approaches) across 100 synthetic documents with 2,000+ formulas reveals significant performance disparities. Our findings provide crucial insights for practitioners selecting parsers for downstream applications and establish a robust, scalable methodology that enables reproducible evaluation of PDF formula extraction quality.

Motivation: Current VLMs excel at perceiving and describing visual content but lack the ability to proactively reason and act based solely on visual inputs without textual prompts, limiting their real-world readiness as autonomous agents.

Method: Introduces Visual Action Reasoning task and VisualActBench benchmark with 1,074 videos and 3,733 human-annotated actions across four real-world scenarios, each labeled with Action Prioritization Level and proactive-reactive type.

Conclusion: VisualActBench provides a comprehensive foundation for assessing and improving VLMs' real-world readiness as proactive, vision-centric AI agents, highlighting current limitations in context interpretation, outcome anticipation, and human decision-making alignment.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in perceiving and describing visual environments. However, their ability to proactively reason and act based solely on visual inputs, without explicit textual prompts, remains underexplored. We introduce a new task, Visual Action Reasoning, and propose VisualActBench, a large-scale benchmark comprising 1,074 videos and 3,733 human-annotated actions across four real-world scenarios. Each action is labeled with an Action Prioritization Level (APL) and a proactive-reactive type to assess models' human-aligned reasoning and value sensitivity. We evaluate 29 VLMs on VisualActBench and find that while frontier models like GPT4o demonstrate relatively strong performance, a significant gap remains compared to human-level reasoning, particularly in generating proactive, high-priority actions. Our results highlight limitations in current VLMs' ability to interpret complex context, anticipate outcomes, and align with human decision-making frameworks. VisualActBench establishes a comprehensive foundation for assessing and improving the real-world readiness of proactive, vision-centric AI agents.

*Or Hirschorn,Omer Sela,Inbar Huberman-Spiegelglas,Netalee Efrat,Eli Alshan,Ianir Ideses,Frederic Devernay,Yochai Zvik,Lior Fritz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Splatent is a diffusion-based enhancement framework that improves 3D Gaussian Splatting in VAE latent space by recovering fine details in 2D through multi-view attention, preserving VAE quality while achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VAE latent space radiance field methods suffer from multi-view inconsistency, causing blurred textures and missing details. Existing solutions either degrade reconstruction quality through VAE fine-tuning or risk hallucinations by relying on diffusion models for detail recovery.

Method: Splatent operates on top of 3D Gaussian Splatting in VAE latent space, using a diffusion-based enhancement framework. Instead of reconstructing details in 3D, it recovers them in 2D from input views using multi-view attention mechanisms, preserving pretrained VAE quality.

Result: Splatent establishes new state-of-the-art for VAE latent radiance field reconstruction across multiple benchmarks. Integration with existing feed-forward frameworks consistently improves detail preservation, enabling high-quality sparse-view 3D reconstruction.

Conclusion: The 2D detail recovery approach through multi-view attention effectively addresses VAE latent space limitations, preserving reconstruction quality while achieving faithful detail recovery, opening new possibilities for high-quality 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Radiance field representations have recently been explored in the latent space of VAEs that are commonly used by diffusion models. This direction offers efficient rendering and seamless integration with diffusion-based pipelines. However, these methods face a fundamental limitation: The VAE latent space lacks multi-view consistency, leading to blurred textures and missing details during 3D reconstruction. Existing approaches attempt to address this by fine-tuning the VAE, at the cost of reconstruction quality, or by relying on pre-trained diffusion models to recover fine-grained details, at the risk of some hallucinations. We present Splatent, a diffusion-based enhancement framework designed to operate on top of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) in the latent space of VAEs. Our key insight departs from the conventional 3D-centric view: rather than reconstructing fine-grained details in 3D space, we recover them in 2D from input views through multi-view attention mechanisms. This approach preserves the reconstruction quality of pretrained VAEs while achieving faithful detail recovery. Evaluated across multiple benchmarks, Splatent establishes a new state-of-the-art for VAE latent radiance field reconstruction. We further demonstrate that integrating our method with existing feed-forward frameworks, consistently improves detail preservation, opening new possibilities for high-quality sparse-view 3D reconstruction.

TL;DR: RVE task bridges reasoning with video editing using ReViSE framework with self-reflective reasoning, achieving 32% improvement over SOTA on new RVE-Bench benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video unified models struggle with reason-informed visual editing despite strong understanding/generation capabilities, due to inadequate datasets and disconnect between reasoning and editing capabilities.

Method: Introduces RVE task requiring physical plausibility and causal dynamics reasoning. Proposes ReViSE framework with Self-Reflective Reasoning (SRF) that unifies generation and evaluation using internal VLM feedback to refine generator's reasoning.

Result: ReViSE significantly enhances editing accuracy and visual fidelity, achieving 32% improvement in Overall score on reasoning-informed video editing subset of RVE-Bench over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The integrated framework successfully bridges reasoning with visual transformation, addressing the gap between models' understanding and editing capabilities through systematic evaluation and self-reflective reasoning.

Abstract: Video unified models exhibit strong capabilities in understanding and generation, yet they struggle with reason-informed visual editing even when equipped with powerful internal vision-language models (VLMs). We attribute this gap to two factors: 1) existing datasets are inadequate for training and evaluating reasoning-aware video editing, and 2) an inherent disconnect between the models' reasoning and editing capabilities, which prevents the rich understanding from effectively instructing the editing process. Bridging this gap requires an integrated framework that connects reasoning with visual transformation. To address this gap, we introduce the Reason-Informed Video Editing (RVE) task, which requires reasoning about physical plausibility and causal dynamics during editing. To support systematic evaluation, we construct RVE-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark with two complementary subsets: Reasoning-Informed Video Editing and In-Context Video Generation. These subsets cover diverse reasoning dimensions and real-world editing scenarios. Building upon this foundation, we propose the ReViSE, a Self-Reflective Reasoning (SRF) framework that unifies generation and evaluation within a single architecture. The model's internal VLM provides intrinsic feedback by assessing whether the edited video logically satisfies the given instruction. The differential feedback that refines the generator's reasoning behavior during training. Extensive experiments on RVE-Bench demonstrate that ReViSE significantly enhances editing accuracy and visual fidelity, achieving a 32% improvement of the Overall score in the reasoning-informed video editing subset over state-of-the-art methods.

*Patrick Noras,Jun Myeong Choi,Didier Stricker,Pieter Peers,Roni Sengupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAINS is a two-stage Gaussian-based inverse rendering framework that uses learning-based priors to improve material recovery from sparse multi-view captures, addressing ambiguity issues in geometry, reflectance, and lighting estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Gaussian Splatting-based inverse rendering methods work well with dense multi-view captures but degrade sharply under sparse-view settings due to severe ambiguity between geometry, reflectance, and lighting parameters.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Geometry refinement using monocular depth/normal and diffusion priors, 2) Material recovery using segmentation, intrinsic image decomposition (IID), and diffusion priors to regularize estimation.

Result: Significantly improves material parameter accuracy, relighting quality, and novel-view synthesis compared to state-of-the-art Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods, especially under sparse-view settings on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: GAINS demonstrates that incorporating learning-based priors into Gaussian-based inverse rendering effectively stabilizes geometry and material estimation, enabling high-quality material recovery from sparse multi-view captures.

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting-based inverse rendering extend Gaussian primitives with shading parameters and physically grounded light transport, enabling high-quality material recovery from dense multi-view captures. However, these methods degrade sharply under sparse-view settings, where limited observations lead to severe ambiguity between geometry, reflectance, and lighting. We introduce GAINS (Gaussian-based Inverse rendering from Sparse multi-view captures), a two-stage inverse rendering framework that leverages learning-based priors to stabilize geometry and material estimation. GAINS first refines geometry using monocular depth/normal and diffusion priors, then employs segmentation, intrinsic image decomposition (IID), and diffusion priors to regularize material recovery. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that GAINS significantly improves material parameter accuracy, relighting quality, and novel-view synthesis compared to state-of-the-art Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods, especially under sparse-view settings.

*Adrian Ryser,Florian Allwein,Tim Schlippe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hallucinations in LLMs lead to context-sensitive trust calibration rather than blanket mistrust, influenced by user factors (expectancy, prior experience, expertise, intuition) and contextual factors (perceived risk, decision stakes).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how LLM hallucinations influence users' trust and interaction patterns in everyday use, moving beyond blanket mistrust assumptions to understand nuanced trust calibration.

Method: Conducted a qualitative study with 192 participants to explore trust dynamics in real-world LLM usage scenarios.

Result: Hallucinations lead to context-sensitive trust calibration. Confirmed existing trust factors (expectancy, prior experience, expertise) and identified intuition as new factor. Validated recursive trust calibration process and extended it with intuition. Found contextual factors (perceived risk, decision stakes) further influence trust dynamics.

Conclusion: Proposed practical recommendations for responsible and reflective LLM use based on understanding of nuanced trust calibration processes influenced by both user-related and contextual factors.

Abstract: Hallucinations are outputs by Large Language Models (LLMs) that are factually incorrect yet appear plausible [1]. This paper investigates how such hallucinations influence users' trust in LLMs and users' interaction with LLMs. To explore this in everyday use, we conducted a qualitative study with 192 participants. Our findings show that hallucinations do not result in blanket mistrust but instead lead to context-sensitive trust calibration. Building on the calibrated trust model by Lee & See [2] and Afroogh et al.'s trust-related factors [3], we confirm expectancy [3], [4], prior experience [3], [4], [5], and user expertise & domain knowledge [3], [4] as userrelated (human) trust factors, and identify intuition as an additional factor relevant for hallucination detection. Additionally, we found that trust dynamics are further influenced by contextual factors, particularly perceived risk [3] and decision stakes [6]. Consequently, we validate the recursive trust calibration process proposed by Blöbaum [7] and extend it by including intuition as a user-related trust factor. Based on these insights, we propose practical recommendations for responsible and reflective LLM use.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI TIPS 2.0 addresses three governance gaps: inadequate risk assessment, lack of actionable controls, and missing operationalization mechanisms for AI deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI governance frameworks fail to address critical challenges: inadequate risk assessment at use case level (e.g., Humana lawsuit), lack of actionable controls from high-level principles, and absence of mechanisms to operationalize governance at scale throughout development lifecycle.

Method: Presents AI TIPS (Artificial Intelligence Trust-Integrated Pillars for Sustainability 2.0), an updated operational framework that provides tailored governance for unique risk profiles, translates principles into specific technical implementations, and embeds trustworthy AI practices systematically.

Result: The framework directly addresses the three identified governance gaps by offering a comprehensive approach that predates NIST's AI Risk Management Framework by four years, providing practical solutions for operationalizing AI governance.

Conclusion: AI TIPS 2.0 offers a needed operational framework that moves beyond conceptual principles to provide actionable governance mechanisms, addressing critical shortcomings in current AI deployment practices and enabling organizations to implement trustworthy AI at scale.

Abstract: The deployment of AI systems faces three critical governance challenges that current frameworks fail to adequately address. First, organizations struggle with inadequate risk assessment at the use case level, exemplified by the Humana class action lawsuit and other high impact cases where an AI system deployed to production exhibited both significant bias and high error rates, resulting in improper healthcare claim denials. Each AI use case presents unique risk profiles requiring tailored governance, yet most frameworks provide one size fits all guidance. Second, existing frameworks like ISO 42001 and NIST AI RMF remain at high conceptual levels, offering principles without actionable controls, leaving practitioners unable to translate governance requirements into specific technical implementations. Third, organizations lack mechanisms for operationalizing governance at scale, with no systematic approach to embed trustworthy AI practices throughout the development lifecycle, measure compliance quantitatively, or provide role-appropriate visibility from boards to data scientists. We present AI TIPS, Artificial Intelligence Trust-Integrated Pillars for Sustainability 2.0, update to the comprehensive operational framework developed in 2019,four years before NIST's AI Risk Management Framework, that directly addresses these challenges.

*Chethana Prasad Kabgere*

TL;DR: Humans use analogical reasoning and shape recognition while AI uses feature-based processing for ambiguous images; neuro-symbolic architectures could unify these approaches for more interpretable AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand differences between human and AI perception of ambiguous visual stimuli, providing insights into perception, reasoning, and decision-making across biological and artificial systems.

Method: Contrasted human strategies (analogical reasoning, shape recognition, confidence modulation) with AI's feature-based processing using Grad-CAM visualizations, analyzed through cognitive frameworks like Marr's tri-level hypothesis, Simon's bounded rationality, and cognitive architectures (ACT-R, Soar).

Result: Revealed key parallels and divergences between human and AI systems in representation, inference, and confidence calibration when interpreting degraded visual stimuli.

Conclusion: Future neuro-symbolic architectures that combine symbolic reasoning with connectionist representations, informed by embodiment and cognitive alignment principles, could create more interpretable and cognitively grounded AI systems.

Abstract: Understanding how humans and AI systems interpret ambiguous visual stimuli offers critical insight into the nature of perception, reasoning, and decision-making. This paper examines image labeling performance across human participants and deep neural networks, focusing on low-resolution, perceptually degraded stimuli. Drawing from computational cognitive science, cognitive architectures, and connectionist-symbolic hybrid models, we contrast human strategies such as analogical reasoning, shape-based recognition, and confidence modulation with AI's feature-based processing. Grounded in Marr's tri-level hypothesis, Simon's bounded rationality, and Thagard's frameworks of representation and emotion, we analyze participant responses in relation to Grad-CAM visualizations of model attention. Human behavior is further interpreted through cognitive principles modeled in ACT-R and Soar, revealing layered and heuristic decision strategies under uncertainty. Our findings highlight key parallels and divergences between biological and artificial systems in representation, inference, and confidence calibration. The analysis motivates future neuro-symbolic architectures that unify structured symbolic reasoning with connectionist representations. Such architectures, informed by principles of embodiment, explainability, and cognitive alignment, offer a path toward AI systems that are not only performant but also interpretable and cognitively grounded.

### [119] [Architectures for Building Agentic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09458)
*Sławomir Nowaczyk*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI reliability is an architectural property achieved through principled componentization, disciplined interfaces, and explicit control loops in agentic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish that reliability in agentic and generative AI systems is fundamentally an architectural concern rather than just a functional requirement, and to provide systematic approaches for building reliable AI systems.

Method: Proposes architectural patterns with principled componentization (goal manager, planner, tool-router, executor, memory, verifiers, safety monitor, telemetry), disciplined interfaces (schema-constrained, validated, least-privilege tool calls), and explicit control/assurance loops. Develops a taxonomy of agent types and analyzes reliability patterns.

Result: A comprehensive architectural framework for reliable agentic AI systems with design guidance on typed schemas, idempotency, permissioning, transactional semantics, memory provenance, runtime governance, and simulate-before-actuate safeguards.

Conclusion: Reliability in AI systems can be systematically achieved through architectural design principles, componentization patterns, and explicit control mechanisms that address specific failure modes across different types of agentic systems.

Abstract: This chapter argues that the reliability of agentic and generative AI is chiefly an architectural property. We define agentic systems as goal-directed, tool-using decision makers operating in closed loops, and show how reliability emerges from principled componentisation (goal manager, planner, tool-router, executor, memory, verifiers, safety monitor, telemetry), disciplined interfaces (schema-constrained, validated, least-privilege tool calls), and explicit control and assurance loops. Building on classical foundations, we propose a practical taxonomy-tool-using agents, memory-augmented agents, planning and self-improvement agents, multi-agent systems, and embodied or web agents - and analyse how each pattern reshapes the reliability envelope and failure modes. We distil design guidance on typed schemas, idempotency, permissioning, transactional semantics, memory provenance and hygiene, runtime governance (budgets, termination conditions), and simulate-before-actuate safeguards.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Trio is a molecular generation framework combining fragment-based language modeling, reinforcement learning, and Monte Carlo tree search for interpretable, closed-loop drug design that balances binding affinity with pharmacological properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional drug discovery methods are slow, expensive, and have low success rates. Current generative models for ligand design often lack generalization, interpretability, and focus too much on binding affinity while neglecting key pharmacological properties, limiting their practical utility.

Method: Trio integrates three components: fragment-based molecular language modeling for context-aware fragment assembly, reinforcement learning to enforce physicochemical and synthetic feasibility, and Monte Carlo tree search to balance exploration of novel chemotypes with exploitation of promising intermediates in protein binding pockets.

Result: Trio outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with improved binding affinity (+7.85%), drug-likeness (+11.10%), and synthetic accessibility (+12.05%), while expanding molecular diversity more than fourfold, reliably producing chemically valid and pharmacologically enhanced ligands.

Conclusion: Trio provides an effective and interpretable framework for closed-loop targeted molecular design that addresses limitations of existing generative models by balancing multiple pharmacological properties and enabling more practical drug discovery applications.

Abstract: Drug discovery is a time-consuming and expensive process, with traditional high-throughput and docking-based virtual screening hampered by low success rates and limited scalability. Recent advances in generative modelling, including autoregressive, diffusion, and flow-based approaches, have enabled de novo ligand design beyond the limits of enumerative screening. Yet these models often suffer from inadequate generalization, limited interpretability, and an overemphasis on binding affinity at the expense of key pharmacological properties, thereby restricting their translational utility. Here we present Trio, a molecular generation framework integrating fragment-based molecular language modeling, reinforcement learning, and Monte Carlo tree search, for effective and interpretable closed-loop targeted molecular design. Through the three key components, Trio enables context-aware fragment assembly, enforces physicochemical and synthetic feasibility, and guides a balanced search between the exploration of novel chemotypes and the exploitation of promising intermediates within protein binding pockets. Experimental results show that Trio reliably achieves chemically valid and pharmacologically enhanced ligands, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches with improved binding affinity (+7.85%), drug-likeness (+11.10%) and synthetic accessibility (+12.05%), while expanding molecular diversity more than fourfold.

*Emanuele La Malfa,Ping Zhu,Samuele Marro,Sara Bernardini,Michael Wooldridge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: End-to-end LLM-powered framework converts natural language specifications to PDDL models, refines them through verification agents, generates plans with external engines, and translates results back to natural language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an automated system that can handle natural language planning specifications without human intervention, addressing common planning requirements like time constraints, optimality, and ambiguities in human specifications.

Method: An orchestrator converts natural language to PDDL, then iterative refinement by LLM-powered agents handles validation, ambiguity resolution, and constraint incorporation. External planning engines generate plans, and a translation module converts final plans back to natural language.

Result: Demonstrated flexibility and effectiveness across various domains including Google NaturalPlan, PlanBench, Blocksworld, and Tower of Hanoi - domains where LLMs typically struggle even with small instances.

Conclusion: The framework represents significant progress toward end-to-end planning aided by LLMs, works with any PDDL planning engine/validator, and requires no human intervention throughout the process.

Abstract: We present an end-to-end framework for planning supported by verifiers. An orchestrator receives a human specification written in natural language and converts it into a PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) model, where the domain and problem are iteratively refined by sub-modules (agents) to address common planning requirements, such as time constraints and optimality, as well as ambiguities and contradictions that may exist in the human specification. The validated domain and problem are then passed to an external planning engine to generate a plan. The orchestrator and agents are powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and require no human intervention at any stage of the process. Finally, a module translates the final plan back into natural language to improve human readability while maintaining the correctness of each step. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our framework across various domains and tasks, including the Google NaturalPlan benchmark and PlanBench, as well as planning problems like Blocksworld and the Tower of Hanoi (where LLMs are known to struggle even with small instances). Our framework can be integrated with any PDDL planning engine and validator (such as Fast Downward, LPG, POPF, VAL, and uVAL, which we have tested) and represents a significant step toward end-to-end planning aided by LLMs.

Motivation: In continuous action spaces with parallel MCTS, how to best aggregate statistics from different threads is important but underexplored, especially for wall-clock limited scenarios where best performance is desired.

Method: Introduces a method using Gaussian Process Regression to obtain value estimates for promising actions that were not trialed in the environment during parallel MCTS execution.

Conclusion: Gaussian Process Regression provides an effective way to aggregate statistics in parallel MCTS for continuous action spaces, improving performance with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Search is a cornerstone algorithm for online planning, and its root-parallel variant is widely used when wall clock time is limited but best performance is desired. In environments with continuous action spaces, how to best aggregate statistics from different threads is an important yet underexplored question. In this work, we introduce a method that uses Gaussian Process Regression to obtain value estimates for promising actions that were not trialed in the environment. We perform a systematic evaluation across 6 different domains, demonstrating that our approach outperforms existing aggregation strategies while requiring a modest increase in inference time.

TL;DR: This paper investigates how MAPF planner design choices affect performance in realistic execution settings, examining solution optimality, kinodynamic modeling accuracy, and their interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a gap between simplified MAPF benchmarks and real-world performance, as existing frameworks use simplified robot models that don't capture practical physical constraints needed for industrial deployment.

Method: Systematically study three key factors: (1) relationship between solution optimality and execution performance, (2) sensitivity to kinodynamic modeling inaccuracies, and (3) interaction between model accuracy and plan optimality using empirical examination in realistic scenarios.

Result: The paper provides empirical findings on how planner design choices affect performance in realistic settings, though specific results aren't detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: The work highlights open challenges and research directions to guide the MAPF community toward practical, real-world deployment by bridging the gap between algorithmic benchmarks and actual performance.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) algorithms are increasingly deployed in industrial warehouses and automated manufacturing facilities, where robots must operate reliably under real-world physical constraints. However, existing MAPF evaluation frameworks typically rely on simplified robot models, leaving a substantial gap between algorithmic benchmarks and practical performance. Recent frameworks such as SMART, incorporate kinodynamic modeling and offer the MAPF community a platform for large-scale, realistic evaluation. Building on this capability, this work investigates how key planner design choices influence performance under realistic execution settings. We systematically study three fundamental factors: (1) the relationship between solution optimality and execution performance, (2) the sensitivity of system performance to inaccuracies in kinodynamic modeling, and (3) the interaction between model accuracy and plan optimality. Empirically, we examine these factors to understand how these design choices affect performance in realistic scenarios. We highlight open challenges and research directions to steer the community toward practical, real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RIFT is a reinforcement learning framework that automates discovery of minimal, high-impact fault scenarios for efficient AI accelerator fault assessment, achieving 2.2× speedup and 99% test reduction while maintaining superior coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fault assessment methods for modern AI accelerators face prohibitive computational costs and poor coverage of critical failure modes due to massive scale, requiring more efficient approaches.

Method: RIFT transforms fault search into sequential decision-making, combining hybrid sensitivity analysis for search space pruning with reinforcement learning to intelligently generate minimal, high-impact test suites.

Result: On billion-parameter LLM workloads using NVIDIA A100 GPUs, RIFT achieves 2.2× fault assessment speedup over evolutionary methods, reduces test vector volume by over 99% compared to random fault injection, and provides 12.8× improvement in cost-effectiveness for selective error correction.

Conclusion: RIFT provides a scalable framework for efficient fault assessment that generates actionable verification artifacts and enables intelligent hardware protection strategies with significantly improved cost-effectiveness.

Abstract: The massive scale of modern AI accelerators presents critical challenges to traditional fault assessment methodologies, which face prohibitive computational costs and provide poor coverage of critical failure modes. This paper introduces RIFT (Reinforcement Learning-guided Intelligent Fault Targeting), a scalable framework that automates the discovery of minimal, high-impact fault scenarios for efficient design-time fault assessment. RIFT transforms the complex search for worst-case faults into a sequential decision-making problem, combining hybrid sensitivity analysis for search space pruning with reinforcement learning to intelligently generate minimal, high-impact test suites. Evaluated on billion-parameter Large Language Model (LLM) workloads using NVIDIA A100 GPUs, RIFT achieves a \textbf{2.2$\times$} fault assessment speedup over evolutionary methods and reduces the required test vector volume by over \textbf{99\%} compared to random fault injection, all while achieving \textbf{superior fault coverage}. The proposed framework also provides actionable data to enable intelligent hardware protection strategies, demonstrating that RIFT-guided selective error correction code provides a \textbf{12.8$\times$} improvement in \textbf{cost-effectiveness} (coverage per unit area) compared to uniform triple modular redundancy protection. RIFT automatically generates UVM-compliant verification artifacts, ensuring its findings are directly actionable and integrable into commercial RTL verification workflows.

### [125] [Interpretation as Linear Transformation: A Cognitive-Geometric Model of Belief and Meaning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09831)
*Chainarong Amornbunchornvej*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A geometric framework modeling belief transmission across cognitively diverse agents using vector spaces and linear maps, showing how beliefs survive or die based on structural compatibility rather than persuasion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a unified geometric framework for understanding belief dynamics, influence, and meaning preservation across cognitively heterogeneous agents, bridging insights from conceptual spaces, social epistemology, and AI value alignment.

Method: Represent agents as personalized value spaces (vector spaces), beliefs as structured vectors, and communication as linear interpretation maps. Analyze belief survival through null space avoidance and structural compatibility conditions.

Result: Establishes structural criteria for intelligibility, miscommunication, and belief death; derives the "No-Null-Space Leadership Condition" characterizing leadership as representational reachability; explains belief distortion, motivational drift, and limits of mutual understanding through algebraic constraints.

Conclusion: The cognitive-geometric perspective grounds meaning preservation in structural compatibility rather than shared information or rationality, clarifying epistemic boundaries of influence and providing a general foundation for analyzing belief dynamics across heterogeneous human and artificial systems.

Abstract: This paper develops a geometric framework for modeling belief, motivation, and influence across cognitively heterogeneous agents. Each agent is represented by a personalized value space, a vector space encoding the internal dimensions through which the agent interprets and evaluates meaning. Beliefs are formalized as structured vectors-abstract beings-whose transmission is mediated by linear interpretation maps. A belief survives communication only if it avoids the null spaces of these maps, yielding a structural criterion for intelligibility, miscommunication, and belief death.
  Within this framework, I show how belief distortion, motivational drift, counterfactual evaluation, and the limits of mutual understanding arise from purely algebraic constraints. A central result-"the No-Null-Space Leadership Condition"-characterizes leadership as a property of representational reachability rather than persuasion or authority. More broadly, the model explains how abstract beings can propagate, mutate, or disappear as they traverse diverse cognitive geometries.
  The account unifies insights from conceptual spaces, social epistemology, and AI value alignment by grounding meaning preservation in structural compatibility rather than shared information or rationality. I argue that this cognitive-geometric perspective clarifies the epistemic boundaries of influence in both human and artificial systems, and offers a general foundation for analyzing belief dynamics across heterogeneous agents.

TL;DR: AI cybersecurity agent ARTEMIS outperformed 9 out of 10 human professionals in live enterprise penetration testing, finding 9 valid vulnerabilities with 82% accuracy at lower cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To conduct the first comprehensive evaluation comparing AI cybersecurity agents against human professionals in real enterprise environments, assessing AI's readiness for practical security testing.

Method: Tested 10 human cybersecurity professionals and 6 existing AI agents alongside ARTEMIS (a new multi-agent framework with dynamic prompt generation, arbitrary sub-agents, and automatic vulnerability triaging) on a university network with ~8,000 hosts across 12 subnets.

Result: ARTEMIS placed second overall, discovered 9 valid vulnerabilities with 82% valid submission rate, outperforming 9 of 10 human participants. AI agents showed advantages in systematic enumeration, parallel exploitation, and cost ($18/hour vs $60/hour for humans), but had higher false-positive rates and struggled with GUI tasks.

Conclusion: AI cybersecurity agents like ARTEMIS demonstrate technical sophistication comparable to top human professionals with significant cost advantages, but still face limitations in false-positive management and GUI-based tasks that need addressing for broader adoption.

Abstract: We present the first comprehensive evaluation of AI agents against human cybersecurity professionals in a live enterprise environment. We evaluate ten cybersecurity professionals alongside six existing AI agents and ARTEMIS, our new agent scaffold, on a large university network consisting of ~8,000 hosts across 12 subnets. ARTEMIS is a multi-agent framework featuring dynamic prompt generation, arbitrary sub-agents, and automatic vulnerability triaging. In our comparative study, ARTEMIS placed second overall, discovering 9 valid vulnerabilities with an 82% valid submission rate and outperforming 9 of 10 human participants. While existing scaffolds such as Codex and CyAgent underperformed relative to most human participants, ARTEMIS demonstrated technical sophistication and submission quality comparable to the strongest participants. We observe that AI agents offer advantages in systematic enumeration, parallel exploitation, and cost -- certain ARTEMIS variants cost $18/hour versus $60/hour for professional penetration testers. We also identify key capability gaps: AI agents exhibit higher false-positive rates and struggle with GUI-based tasks.

### [128] [SCOPE: Language Models as One-Time Teacher for Hierarchical Planning in Text Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09897)
*Haoye Lu,Pavan Seshadri,Kaheer Suleman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SCOPE is an efficient hierarchical planner that uses LLM-generated subgoals only at initialization to pretrain a lightweight student model, achieving better performance and 55x faster inference than LLM-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based planning methods are computationally expensive (require repeated LLM queries during training/inference) and use fixed LLM parameters that can't adapt to target tasks. Need more efficient planning for text-based environments.

Method: SCOPE uses LLM-generated subgoals only at initialization to pretrain a lightweight student model. Unlike prior methods that repeatedly query LLMs for adaptive subgoal generation, SCOPE derives subgoals directly from example trajectories in a one-shot manner.

Result: On TextCraft environment: Achieves 0.56 success rate (vs ADaPT's 0.52) and reduces inference time from 164.4 seconds to 3.0 seconds (55x faster). Shows LLM-generated subgoals can serve as strong starting point despite potential suboptimality.

Conclusion: SCOPE demonstrates that LLM-generated subgoals can effectively bootstrap hierarchical planning while dramatically improving efficiency, though at the cost of reduced explainability and potentially suboptimal subgoals compared to adaptive LLM querying.

Abstract: Long-term planning in complex, text-based environments presents significant challenges due to open-ended action spaces, ambiguous observations, and sparse feedback. Recent research suggests that large language models (LLMs) encode rich semantic knowledge about the world, which can be valuable for guiding agents in high-level reasoning and planning across both embodied and purely textual settings. However, existing approaches often depend heavily on querying LLMs during training and inference, making them computationally expensive and difficult to deploy efficiently. In addition, these methods typically employ a pretrained, unaltered LLM whose parameters remain fixed throughout training, providing no opportunity for adaptation to the target task. To address these limitations, we introduce SCOPE (Subgoal-COnditioned Pretraining for Efficient planning), a one-shot hierarchical planner that leverages LLM-generated subgoals only at initialization to pretrain a lightweight student model. Unlike prior approaches that distill LLM knowledge by repeatedly prompting the model to adaptively generate subgoals during training, our method derives subgoals directly from example trajectories. This design removes the need for repeated LLM queries, significantly improving efficiency, though at the cost of reduced explainability and potentially suboptimal subgoals. Despite their suboptimality, our results on the TextCraft environment show that LLM-generated subgoals can still serve as a strong starting point for hierarchical goal decomposition in text-based planning tasks. Compared to the LLM-based hierarchical agent ADaPT (Prasad et al., 2024), which achieves a 0.52 success rate, our method reaches 0.56 and reduces inference time from 164.4 seconds to just 3.0 seconds.

### [129] [Bayesian Networks, Markov Networks, Moralisation, Triangulation: a Categorical Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09908)
*Antonio Lorenzin,Fabio Zanasi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a categorical framework where moralisation and triangulation transformations between Bayesian and Markov networks are modeled as functors, with variable elimination reinterpreted as a functor that splits triangulation into syntactic and semantic components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a categorical framework for understanding the transformations between Bayesian networks (directed models) and Markov networks (undirected models), specifically moralisation and triangulation, and to highlight the distinction between syntactic and semantic aspects of these transformations.

Method: Develops categories of Bayesian networks and Markov networks as functors from a 'syntax' domain to a 'semantics' codomain. Models moralisation and triangulation as functors between these categories, with moralisation defined purely syntactically and triangulation involving semantics. Reinterprets variable elimination algorithm as a functor that splits triangulation into syntactic and semantic components.

Result: Establishes a functorial perspective on probabilistic graphical models, showing how moralisation and triangulation can be defined inductively via functor pre-composition, and demonstrates how variable elimination can be understood as separating the syntactic and semantic aspects of triangulation.

Conclusion: The categorical framework introduces a novel functorial perspective into probabilistic graphical model theory, clarifying the distinctions between syntactic and semantic modifications in transformations between Bayesian and Markov networks, with implications for understanding algorithms like variable elimination.

Abstract: Moralisation and Triangulation are transformations allowing to switch between different ways of factoring a probability distribution into a graphical model. Moralisation allows to view a Bayesian network (a directed model) as a Markov network (an undirected model), whereas triangulation addresses the opposite direction. We present a categorical framework where these transformations are modelled as functors between a category of Bayesian networks and one of Markov networks. The two kinds of network (the objects of these categories) are themselves represented as functors from a `syntax' domain to a `semantics' codomain. Notably, moralisation and triangulation can be defined inductively on such syntax via functor pre-composition. Moreover, while moralisation is fully syntactic, triangulation relies on semantics. This leads to a discussion of the variable elimination algorithm, reinterpreted here as a functor in its own right, that splits the triangulation procedure in two: one purely syntactic, the other purely semantic. This approach introduces a functorial perspective into the theory of probabilistic graphical models, which highlights the distinctions between syntactic and semantic modifications.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ShelfAware: semantic particle filter for robust global localization in quasi-static indoor environments using category-level semantics and inverse semantic proposals


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quasi-static indoor environments (like warehouses, labs, retail) have stable global layout but constantly changing local semantics, causing repetitive geometry, dynamic clutter, and perceptual noise that defeat traditional vision-based localization methods

Method: Semantic particle filter that treats scene semantics as statistical evidence over object categories rather than fixed landmarks. Fuses depth likelihood with category-centric semantic similarity, uses precomputed bank of semantic viewpoints for inverse semantic proposals inside Monte Carlo Localization (MCL)

Result: 96% success rate across 100 trials (vs 22% MCL, 10% AMCL), mean time-to-convergence 1.91s, lowest translational RMSE in all conditions, stable tracking in 80% of sequences, runs in real-time on consumer laptop

Conclusion: By modeling semantics distributionally at category level and using inverse proposals, ShelfAware resolves geometric aliasing and semantic drift in quasi-static domains. Requires only vision sensors and VIO, enabling infrastructure-free mobile robot applications and assistive navigation for visually impaired

Abstract: Many indoor workspaces are quasi-static: global layout is stable but local semantics change continually, producing repetitive geometry, dynamic clutter, and perceptual noise that defeat vision-based localization. We present ShelfAware, a semantic particle filter for robust global localization that treats scene semantics as statistical evidence over object categories rather than fixed landmarks. ShelfAware fuses a depth likelihood with a category-centric semantic similarity and uses a precomputed bank of semantic viewpoints to perform inverse semantic proposals inside MCL, yielding fast, targeted hypothesis generation on low-cost, vision-only hardware. Across 100 global-localization trials spanning four conditions (cart-mounted, wearable, dynamic obstacles, and sparse semantics) in a semantically dense, retail environment, ShelfAware achieves a 96% success rate (vs. 22% MCL and 10% AMCL) with a mean time-to-convergence of 1.91s, attains the lowest translational RMSE in all conditions, and maintains stable tracking in 80% of tested sequences, all while running in real time on a consumer laptop-class platform. By modeling semantics distributionally at the category level and leveraging inverse proposals, ShelfAware resolves geometric aliasing and semantic drift common to quasi-static domains. Because the method requires only vision sensors and VIO, it integrates as an infrastructure-free building block for mobile robots in warehouses, labs, and retail settings; as a representative application, it also supports the creation of assistive devices providing start-anytime, shared-control assistive navigation for people with visual impairments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Robot movements can reveal human operator's emotions with 83.3% accuracy using machine learning, even when robot wasn't designed for emotional expression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Operator's emotional state affects robot motions with unexpected consequences, but current emotion recognition methods require intrusive devices or user participation that limit remote robot control applications.

Method: Used machine learning system to infer emotional state from functional movements of remote-controlled robotic avatar, analyzing robot movements resulting from operator's hand motions.

Result: Achieved 83.3% accuracy in recognizing user's emotional state expressed through robot movements, demonstrating that robots not designed for emotional expression can still convey operator emotions.

Conclusion: Robot movements can serve as non-intrusive indicator of operator emotions, with implications for improving remote robot operation safety and affective robotics applications.

Abstract: A remote robot operator's affective state can significantly impact the resulting robot's motions leading to unexpected consequences, even when the user follows protocol and performs permitted tasks. The recognition of a user operator's affective states in remote robot control scenarios is, however, underexplored. Current emotion recognition methods rely on reading the user's vital signs or body language, but the devices and user participation these measures require would add limitations to remote robot control. We demonstrate that the functional movements of a remote-controlled robotic avatar, which was not designed for emotional expression, can be used to infer the emotional state of the human operator via a machine-learning system. Specifically, our system achieved 83.3$\%$ accuracy in recognizing the user's emotional state expressed by robot movements, as a result of their hand motions. We discuss the implications of this system on prominent current and future remote robot operation and affective robotic contexts.

TL;DR: MGP is a visuomotor imitation learning framework that uses discrete action tokens with parallel masked generation and refinement, achieving faster inference and higher success rates than diffusion/autoregressive policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of prior methods in handling complex, non-Markovian robotic manipulation tasks that require globally coherent predictions and adaptive execution capabilities.

Method: Represents actions as discrete tokens, trains conditional masked transformer for parallel generation, then refines only low-confidence tokens. Proposes MGP-Short for Markovian tasks and MGP-Long for non-Markovian tasks with dynamic refinement based on new observations.

Result: Achieves 9% higher average success rate across 150 tasks while reducing inference time by up to 35x. Improves success rate by 60% in dynamic/missing-observation environments and solves two non-Markovian scenarios where other methods fail.

Conclusion: MGP enables reliable control on complex non-Markovian tasks through globally coherent prediction and adaptive execution, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both speed and success rates.

Abstract: We present Masked Generative Policy (MGP), a novel framework for visuomotor imitation learning. We represent actions as discrete tokens, and train a conditional masked transformer that generates tokens in parallel and then rapidly refines only low-confidence tokens. We further propose two new sampling paradigms: MGP-Short, which performs parallel masked generation with score-based refinement for Markovian tasks, and MGP-Long, which predicts full trajectories in a single pass and dynamically refines low-confidence action tokens based on new observations. With globally coherent prediction and robust adaptive execution capabilities, MGP-Long enables reliable control on complex and non-Markovian tasks that prior methods struggle with. Extensive evaluations on 150 robotic manipulation tasks spanning the Meta-World and LIBERO benchmarks show that MGP achieves both rapid inference and superior success rates compared to state-of-the-art diffusion and autoregressive policies. Specifically, MGP increases the average success rate by 9% across 150 tasks while cutting per-sequence inference time by up to 35x. It further improves the average success rate by 60% in dynamic and missing-observation environments, and solves two non-Markovian scenarios where other state-of-the-art methods fail.

TL;DR: High robotic attentiveness can compensate for low competence in building cognitive trust, revealing an affective compensatory mechanism in human-robot interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the interplay between performance factors (competence) and affective factors (attentiveness) in shaping cognitive trust, specifically investigating whether attentiveness can compensate for lack of competence.

Method: 2x2 experimental design with search task using robotic dog, manipulating competence (high/low) and attentiveness (high/low), measuring participants' reported trust levels.

Result: High attentiveness compensated for low competence - participants with highly attentive but low-competence robot reported trust levels comparable to those with highly competent robot. Low attentiveness combined with low competence caused substantial trust decrease.

Conclusion: Cognitive trust in HRI involves emotional processes beyond just competence; affective compensatory mechanisms add complexity to traditional competence-based trust models.

Abstract: Cognitive trust and the belief that a robot is capable of accurately performing tasks, are recognized as central factors in fostering high-quality human-robot interactions. It is well established that performance factors such as the robot's competence and its reliability shape cognitive trust. Recent studies suggest that affective factors, such as robotic attentiveness, also play a role in building cognitive trust. This work explores the interplay between these two factors that shape cognitive trust. Specifically, we evaluated whether different combinations of robotic competence and attentiveness introduce a compensatory mechanism, where one factor compensates for the lack of the other. In the experiment, participants performed a search task with a robotic dog in a 2x2 experimental design that included two factors: competence (high or low) and attentiveness (high or low). The results revealed that high attentiveness can compensate for low competence. Participants who collaborated with a highly attentive robot that performed poorly reported trust levels comparable to those working with a highly competent robot. When the robot did not demonstrate attentiveness, low competence resulted in a substantial decrease in cognitive trust. The findings indicate that building cognitive trust in human-robot interaction may be more complex than previously believed, involving emotional processes that are typically overlooked. We highlight an affective compensatory mechanism that adds a layer to consider alongside traditional competence-based models of cognitive trust.

TL;DR: SAGES is a framework that converts natural language commands into spacecraft trajectories while respecting nonconvex constraints, achieving over 90% semantic-behavioral consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous trajectory optimization methods require extensive expert input (waypoints, constraints, mission timelines), limiting operational scalability in real rendezvous missions. There's a need for more intuitive, language-based guidance systems.

Method: SAGES (Semantic Autonomous Guidance Engine for Space) translates natural-language commands into spacecraft trajectories that reflect high-level intent while respecting nonconvex constraints. The framework was tested in fault-tolerant proximity operations with continuous-time constraint enforcement and on a free-flying robotic platform.

Result: SAGES reliably produces trajectories aligned with human commands, achieving over 90% semantic-behavioral consistency across diverse behavior modes. The system enables interactive guidance through natural language with reduced expert burden.

Conclusion: This work represents an initial step toward language-conditioned, constraint-aware spacecraft trajectory generation, enabling operators to guide both safety and behavior through intuitive natural-language commands while reducing the need for extensive expert input.

Abstract: Reliable real-time trajectory generation is essential for future autonomous spacecraft. While recent progress in nonconvex guidance and control is paving the way for onboard autonomous trajectory optimization, these methods still rely on extensive expert input (e.g., waypoints, constraints, mission timelines, etc.), which limits the operational scalability in real rendezvous missions.This paper introduces SAGES (Semantic Autonomous Guidance Engine for Space), a trajectory-generation framework that translates natural-language commands into spacecraft trajectories that reflect high-level intent while respecting nonconvex constraints. Experiments in two settings -- fault-tolerant proximity operations with continuous-time constraint enforcement and a free-flying robotic platform -- demonstrate that SAGES reliably produces trajectories aligned with human commands, achieving over 90\% semantic-behavioral consistency across diverse behavior modes. Ultimately, this work marks an initial step toward language-conditioned, constraint-aware spacecraft trajectory generation, enabling operators to interactively guide both safety and behavior through intuitive natural-language commands with reduced expert burden.

TL;DR: UPETrack is a geometry-driven framework for real-time tracking of Deformable Linear Objects using Unidirectional Position Estimation that handles occlusions without physical modeling or markers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time state tracking of Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs) is critical for robotic manipulation in industrial, medical, and daily-life applications, but high-dimensional configuration space, nonlinear dynamics, and frequent partial occlusions present fundamental barriers to robust tracking.

Method: Two-phase framework: (1) visible segment tracking using Gaussian Mixture Model fitted via Expectation Maximization algorithm, and (2) occlusion region prediction using Unidirectional Position Estimation algorithm that leverages geometric continuity through three mechanisms: local linear combination displacement term, proximal linear constraint term, and historical curvature term.

Result: UPETrack surpasses two state-of-the-art tracking algorithms (TrackDLO and CDCPD2) in both positioning accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The geometry-driven UPETrack framework provides efficient and stable estimation of occluded DLO nodes through explicit linear combinations of geometric components, eliminating the need for additional iterative optimization while achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Real-time state tracking of Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs) is critical for enabling robotic manipulation of DLOs in industrial assembly, medical procedures, and daily-life applications. However, the high-dimensional configuration space, nonlinear dynamics, and frequent partial occlusions present fundamental barriers to robust real-time DLO tracking. To address these limitations, this study introduces UPETrack, a geometry-driven framework based on Unidirectional Position Estimation (UPE), which facilitates tracking without the requirement for physical modeling, virtual simulation, or visual markers. The framework operates in two phases: (1) visible segment tracking is based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) fitted via the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, and (2) occlusion region prediction employing UPE algorithm we proposed. UPE leverages the geometric continuity inherent in DLO shapes and their temporal evolution patterns to derive a closed-form positional estimator through three principal mechanisms: (i) local linear combination displacement term, (ii) proximal linear constraint term, and (iii) historical curvature term. This analytical formulation allows efficient and stable estimation of occluded nodes through explicit linear combinations of geometric components, eliminating the need for additional iterative optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that UPETrack surpasses two state-of-the-art tracking algorithms, including TrackDLO and CDCPD2, in both positioning accuracy and computational efficiency.

TL;DR: BiDemoSyn synthesizes thousands of bimanual manipulation demonstrations from a single real example by decomposing tasks into coordination blocks and object adjustments, enabling scalable imitation learning without repeated teleoperation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current bimanual manipulation learning faces trade-offs: teleoperation provides high-quality but labor-intensive data, while simulation scales but suffers from sim-to-real gaps. There's a need for scalable, physically grounded demonstration generation.

Method: Decompose tasks into invariant coordination blocks and variable object-dependent adjustments, then adapt them through vision-guided alignment and lightweight trajectory optimization to generate diverse demonstrations from a single real example.

Result: Across six dual-arm tasks, policies trained on BiDemoSyn data generalize robustly to novel object poses and shapes, significantly outperforming recent baselines, generating thousands of demonstrations within hours.

Conclusion: BiDemoSyn bridges the gap between efficiency and real-world fidelity, providing a scalable path for practical imitation learning in complex bimanual manipulation without compromising physical grounding.

Abstract: Learning dexterous bimanual manipulation policies critically depends on large-scale, high-quality demonstrations, yet current paradigms face inherent trade-offs: teleoperation provides physically grounded data but is prohibitively labor-intensive, while simulation-based synthesis scales efficiently but suffers from sim-to-real gaps. We present BiDemoSyn, a framework that synthesizes contact-rich, physically feasible bimanual demonstrations from a single real-world example. The key idea is to decompose tasks into invariant coordination blocks and variable, object-dependent adjustments, then adapt them through vision-guided alignment and lightweight trajectory optimization. This enables the generation of thousands of diverse and feasible demonstrations within several hour, without repeated teleoperation or reliance on imperfect simulation. Across six dual-arm tasks, we show that policies trained on BiDemoSyn data generalize robustly to novel object poses and shapes, significantly outperforming recent baselines. By bridging the gap between efficiency and real-world fidelity, BiDemoSyn provides a scalable path toward practical imitation learning for complex bimanual manipulation without compromising physical grounding.

*Kwang Bin Lee,Jiho Kang,Sung-Hee Lee*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A unified framework for scene-agnostic bimanual task planning that bridges high-level reasoning with 3D-grounded two-handed execution through visual point grounding, spatial reasoning, and structured skill binding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied agents need to execute coordinated bimanual manipulation in open environments, but existing robotic task planners are predominantly unimanual and fail to address spatial, geometric, and coordination challenges in scene-agnostic settings.

Method: Three integrated modules: 1) Visual Point Grounding (VPG) analyzes scene images to detect objects and generate world-aligned interaction points; 2) Bimanual Subgoal Planner (BSP) reasons over spatial adjacency and cross-object accessibility to produce compact, motion-neutralized subgoals; 3) Interaction-Point-Driven Bimanual Prompting (IPBP) binds subgoals to a structured skill library for synchronized unimanual or bimanual action sequences.

Result: The framework produces coherent, feasible, and compact two-handed plans that generalize to cluttered, previously unseen scenes without retraining, demonstrating robust scene-agnostic affordance reasoning for bimanual tasks.

Conclusion: The unified framework enables agents to plan semantically meaningful, physically feasible, and parallelizable two-handed behaviors in cluttered, unseen scenes, bridging high-level reasoning with 3D-grounded execution for bimanual manipulation.

Abstract: Embodied agents operating in open environments must translate high-level instructions into grounded, executable behaviors, often requiring coordinated use of both hands. While recent foundation models offer strong semantic reasoning, existing robotic task planners remain predominantly unimanual and fail to address the spatial, geometric, and coordination challenges inherent to bimanual manipulation in scene-agnostic settings. We present a unified framework for scene-agnostic bimanual task planning that bridges high-level reasoning with 3D-grounded two-handed execution. Our approach integrates three key modules. Visual Point Grounding (VPG) analyzes a single scene image to detect relevant objects and generate world-aligned interaction points. Bimanual Subgoal Planner (BSP) reasons over spatial adjacency and cross-object accessibility to produce compact, motion-neutralized subgoals that exploit opportunities for coordinated two-handed actions. Interaction-Point-Driven Bimanual Prompting (IPBP) binds these subgoals to a structured skill library, instantiating synchronized unimanual or bimanual action sequences that satisfy hand-state and affordance constraints. Together, these modules enable agents to plan semantically meaningful, physically feasible, and parallelizable two-handed behaviors in cluttered, previously unseen scenes. Experiments show that it produces coherent, feasible, and compact two-handed plans, and generalizes to cluttered scenes without retraining, demonstrating robust scene-agnostic affordance reasoning for bimanual tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: QuadPlanes need perception-based landing in unstructured GPS-denied environments, but real-world deployment faces challenges with edge AI constraints, accurate pose estimation, and QuadPlane flight characteristics.

Method: Developed lightweight QuadPlane system with optimized hardware platform, sensor configuration, and embedded computing architecture for real-time vision-based landing and visual-inertial odometry.

Result: Established foundation for deploying autonomous landing in dynamic, unstructured, GPS-denied environments for long-range QuadPlane operations like aerial monitoring.

Conclusion: The work presents a practical solution for vision-based autonomous landing on QuadPlanes by addressing real-world constraints through careful system optimization.

Abstract: QuadPlanes combine the range efficiency of fixed-wing aircraft with the maneuverability of multi-rotor platforms for long-range autonomous missions. In GPS-denied or cluttered urban environments, perception-based landing is vital for reliable operation. Unlike structured landing zones, real-world sites are unstructured and highly variable, requiring strong generalization capabilities from the perception system. Deep neural networks (DNNs) provide a scalable solution for learning landing site features across diverse visual and environmental conditions. While perception-driven landing has been shown in simulation, real-world deployment introduces significant challenges. Payload and volume constraints limit high-performance edge AI devices like the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, which are crucial for real-time detection and control. Accurate pose estimation during descent is necessary, especially in the absence of GPS, and relies on dependable visual-inertial odometry. Achieving this with limited edge AI resources requires careful optimization of the entire deployment framework. The flight characteristics of large QuadPlanes further complicate the problem. These aircraft exhibit high inertia, reduced thrust vectoring, and slow response times further complicate stable landing maneuvers. This work presents a lightweight QuadPlane system for efficient vision-based autonomous landing and visual-inertial odometry, specifically developed for long-range QuadPlane operations such as aerial monitoring. It describes the hardware platform, sensor configuration, and embedded computing architecture designed to meet demanding real-time, physical constraints. This establishes a foundation for deploying autonomous landing in dynamic, unstructured, GPS-denied environments.

Introduces consistency loss to align VLM's semantic plans with RL agent's control outputs.

Result: Experiments in CARLA simulator show 30% improvement in success rate in trained environments and 50% improvement in unseen environments, demonstrating strong generalization capability.

Conclusion: COVLM-RL effectively bridges high-level semantic reasoning with low-level control, improving training efficiency, interpretability, and generalization in autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving frameworks face persistent challenges in generalization, training efficiency, and interpretability. While recent methods leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) through supervised learning on large-scale datasets to improve reasoning, they often lack robustness in novel scenarios. Conversely, reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches enhance adaptability but remain data-inefficient and lack transparent decision-making. % contribution To address these limitations, we propose COVLM-RL, a novel end-to-end driving framework that integrates Critical Object-oriented (CO) reasoning with VLM-guided RL. Specifically, we design a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategy that enables the VLM to reason over critical traffic elements and generate high-level semantic decisions, effectively transforming multi-view visual inputs into structured semantic decision priors. These priors reduce the input dimensionality and inject task-relevant knowledge into the RL loop, accelerating training and improving policy interpretability. However, bridging high-level semantic guidance with continuous low-level control remains non-trivial. To this end, we introduce a consistency loss that encourages alignment between the VLM's semantic plans and the RL agent's control outputs, enhancing interpretability and training stability. Experiments conducted in the CARLA simulator demonstrate that COVLM-RL significantly improves the success rate by 30\% in trained driving environments and by 50\% in previously unseen environments, highlighting its strong generalization capability.

TL;DR: The paper proves that a two-drone-bar suspended transportation system's payload pose is observable using only drone odometry when ≤2 types of lumped disturbances exist, enabling reduced sensor requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for precise load manipulation in cooperative aerial transportation require extra sensors to measure cable directions or payload pose, increasing cost and complexity. The fundamental question is whether payload pose is observable under multi-source disturbances using only drone odometry.

Method: Focuses on two-drone-bar system and uses observability rank criterion to prove system observability with ≤2 lumped disturbance types. Develops composite disturbance filtering scheme with disturbance observer-based error-state extended Kalman filter for state and disturbance estimation on manifold (ℝ³)²×(TS²)³.

Result: Proves system is observable with only drone odometry when ≤2 lumped disturbance types exist (first such conclusion). Simulation and experimental tests validate full state and disturbance estimation is possible with only drone odometry information.

Conclusion: Payload pose in two-drone-bar suspended transportation systems is observable under multi-source disturbances using only drone odometry, enabling more cost-effective and robust systems by minimizing sensor suites while maintaining precise load manipulation.

Abstract: Cooperative suspended aerial transportation is highly susceptible to multi-source disturbances such as aerodynamic effects and thrust uncertainties. To achieve precise load manipulation, existing methods often rely on extra sensors to measure cable directions or the payload's pose, which increases the system cost and complexity. A fundamental question remains: is the payload's pose observable under multi-source disturbances using only the drones' odometry information? To answer this question, this work focuses on the two-drone-bar system and proves that the whole system is observable when only two or fewer types of lumped disturbances exist by using the observability rank criterion. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present such a conclusion and this result paves the way for more cost-effective and robust systems by minimizing their sensor suites. Next, to validate this analysis, we consider the situation where the disturbances are only exerted on the drones, and develop a composite disturbance filtering scheme. A disturbance observer-based error-state extended Kalman filter is designed for both state and disturbance estimation, which renders improved estimation performance for the whole system evolving on the manifold $(\mathbb{R}^3)^2\times(TS^2)^3$. Our simulation and experimental tests have validated that it is possible to fully estimate the state and disturbance of the system with only odometry information of the drones.

TL;DR: A video-to-video translation framework converts human-object interaction videos into realistic robot manipulation videos without paired human-robot training data, using inpainting and visual cues to bridge the embodiment gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robots to learn manipulation skills from abundant everyday human videos without tedious robot data collection, scaling up robot learning capabilities.

Method: Uses video-to-video translation with inpainting (removing robot arm/human) and visual cues (marker+arrow for gripper pose), fine-tunes Wan 2.2 video diffusion model with in-context learning for temporal coherence.

Result: Achieves significantly more realistic and physically grounded robot motions compared to baselines, demonstrating effective translation from human to robot videos.

Conclusion: Presents a promising direction for scaling robot learning from unlabeled human videos by bridging the embodiment gap through transferable representations and video diffusion models.

Abstract: Robots that learn manipulation skills from everyday human videos could acquire broad capabilities without tedious robot data collection. We propose a video-to-video translation framework that converts ordinary human-object interaction videos into motion-consistent robot manipulation videos with realistic, physically grounded interactions. Our approach does not require any paired human-robot videos for training only a set of unpaired robot videos, making the system easy to scale. We introduce a transferable representation that bridges the embodiment gap: by inpainting the robot arm in training videos to obtain a clean background and overlaying a simple visual cue (a marker and arrow indicating the gripper's position and orientation), we can condition a generative model to insert the robot arm back into the scene. At test time, we apply the same process to human videos (inpainting the person and overlaying human pose cues) and generate high-quality robot videos that mimic the human's actions. We fine-tune a SOTA video diffusion model (Wan 2.2) in an in-context learning manner to ensure temporal coherence and leveraging of its rich prior knowledge. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach achieves significantly more realistic and grounded robot motions compared to baselines, pointing to a promising direction for scaling up robot learning from unlabeled human videos.

Conclusion: PGF-MAPPO effectively bridges topological planning with reactive control, solving sparse reward and exploration challenges in multi-agent pursuit-evasion while maintaining scalability for robotic swarms.

Abstract: Collaborative pursuit-evasion in cluttered environments presents significant challenges due to sparse rewards and constrained Fields of View (FOV). Standard Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) often suffers from inefficient exploration and fails to scale to large scenarios. We propose PGF-MAPPO (Path-Guided Frontier MAPPO), a hierarchical framework bridging topological planning with reactive control. To resolve local minima and sparse rewards, we integrate an A*-based potential field for dense reward shaping. Furthermore, we introduce Directional Frontier Allocation, combining Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) with geometric angle suppression to enforce spatial dispersion and accelerate coverage. The architecture employs a parameter-shared decentralized critic, maintaining O(1) model complexity suitable for robotic swarms. Experiments demonstrate that PGF-MAPPO achieves superior capture efficiency against faster evaders. Policies trained on 10x10 maps exhibit robust zero-shot generalization to unseen 20x20 environments, significantly outperforming rule-based and learning-based baselines.

TL;DR: Autonomous vehicles learn altruistic behaviors through decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning to coordinate with human drivers and improve traffic flow/safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In mixed-autonomy environments, autonomous vehicles need to consider other vehicles' utilities to achieve socially-desirable behaviors, but human driver cooperation willingness is ambiguous and existing models are limited.

Method: Multi-agent variant of synchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm that trains autonomous agents to implicitly learn human driver decision-making from experience without explicit behavior models.

Result: Agents learn to coordinate with each other and influence human driver behavior to improve traffic flow and safety through decentralized reward structures that induce altruism.

Conclusion: End-to-end multi-agent reinforcement learning enables autonomous vehicles to develop altruistic behaviors that account for both autonomous and human-driven vehicles' interests in mixed-autonomy environments.

Abstract: With the adoption of autonomous vehicles on our roads, we will witness a mixed-autonomy environment where autonomous and human-driven vehicles must learn to co-exist by sharing the same road infrastructure. To attain socially-desirable behaviors, autonomous vehicles must be instructed to consider the utility of other vehicles around them in their decision-making process. Particularly, we study the maneuver planning problem for autonomous vehicles and investigate how a decentralized reward structure can induce altruism in their behavior and incentivize them to account for the interest of other autonomous and human-driven vehicles. This is a challenging problem due to the ambiguity of a human driver's willingness to cooperate with an autonomous vehicle. Thus, in contrast with the existing works which rely on behavior models of human drivers, we take an end-to-end approach and let the autonomous agents to implicitly learn the decision-making process of human drivers only from experience. We introduce a multi-agent variant of the synchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm and train agents that coordinate with each other and can affect the behavior of human drivers to improve traffic flow and safety.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: D²GSLAM: A dynamic SLAM system using Gaussian representation that simultaneously performs accurate dynamic reconstruction and robust tracking in dynamic environments by separating static/dynamic elements, using composite 3D/4D Gaussian representations, progressive pose refinement, and motion consistency loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dense SLAM methods work well in static environments but struggle with dynamic scenes. Most approaches simply remove dynamic objects, ignoring valuable motion information contained in these objects. There's a need for SLAM systems that can handle dynamic environments while preserving and utilizing motion information.

Method: Four key components: 1) Geometric-prompt dynamic separation method using Gaussian representation consistency to identify dynamic regions; 2) Dynamic-static composite representation combining static 3D Gaussians with dynamic 4D Gaussians; 3) Progressive pose refinement strategy using both static geometry and dynamic motion information; 4) Motion consistency loss leveraging temporal continuity for accurate dynamic modeling.

Result: D²GSLAM demonstrates superior performance on dynamic scenes in terms of both mapping and tracking accuracy, while also showing capability in accurate dynamic modeling compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed D²GSLAM system successfully addresses the challenge of dense SLAM in dynamic environments by simultaneously performing accurate dynamic reconstruction and robust tracking, utilizing Gaussian representation and novel techniques for dynamic-static separation and modeling.

Abstract: Recent advances in Dense Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) have demonstrated remarkable performance in static environments. However, dense SLAM in dynamic environments remains challenging. Most methods directly remove dynamic objects and focus solely on static scene reconstruction, which ignores the motion information contained in these dynamic objects. In this paper, we present D$^2$GSLAM, a novel dynamic SLAM system utilizing Gaussian representation, which simultaneously performs accurate dynamic reconstruction and robust tracking within dynamic environments. Our system is composed of four key components: (i) We propose a geometric-prompt dynamic separation method to distinguish between static and dynamic elements of the scene. This approach leverages the geometric consistency of Gaussian representation and scene geometry to obtain coarse dynamic regions. The regions then serve as prompts to guide the refinement of the coarse mask for achieving accurate motion mask. (ii) To facilitate accurate and efficient mapping of the dynamic scene, we introduce dynamic-static composite representation that integrates static 3D Gaussians with dynamic 4D Gaussians. This representation allows for modeling the transitions between static and dynamic states of objects in the scene for composite mapping and optimization. (iii) We employ a progressive pose refinement strategy that leverages both the multi-view consistency of static scene geometry and motion information from dynamic objects to achieve accurate camera tracking. (iv) We introduce a motion consistency loss, which leverages the temporal continuity in object motions for accurate dynamic modeling. Our D$^2$GSLAM demonstrates superior performance on dynamic scenes in terms of mapping and tracking accuracy, while also showing capability in accurate dynamic modeling.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AVs use prediction-aware RL with social navigation to safely interact with human-driven vehicles by anticipating their behavior changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AV navigation is challenging because human-driven vehicles continuously adapt their policies in response to AVs, requiring AVs to predict these changes for safe social interactions, similar to how humans navigate complex social settings.

Method: Integration of social navigation and prediction through RL framework with Hybrid Predictive Network (HPN) for multi-step future observation prediction, value function network using predicted observations, and safety prioritizer to mask unsafe actions.

Result: Prediction-aware AV outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in simulated scenarios, showing improvements in both efficiency and safety.

Conclusion: Combining social navigation with prediction capabilities in RL framework enables AVs to better anticipate and respond to human-driven vehicle behavior, leading to safer and more efficient autonomous navigation.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle (AV) navigation in the presence of Human-driven vehicles (HVs) is challenging, as HVs continuously update their policies in response to AVs. In order to navigate safely in the presence of complex AV-HV social interactions, the AVs must learn to predict these changes. Humans are capable of navigating such challenging social interaction settings because of their intrinsic knowledge about other agents behaviors and use that to forecast what might happen in the future. Inspired by humans, we provide our AVs the capability of anticipating future states and leveraging prediction in a cooperative reinforcement learning (RL) decision-making framework, to improve safety and robustness. In this paper, we propose an integration of two essential and earlier-presented components of AVs: social navigation and prediction. We formulate the AV decision-making process as a RL problem and seek to obtain optimal policies that produce socially beneficial results utilizing a prediction-aware planning and social-aware optimization RL framework. We also propose a Hybrid Predictive Network (HPN) that anticipates future observations. The HPN is used in a multi-step prediction chain to compute a window of predicted future observations to be used by the value function network (VFN). Finally, a safe VFN is trained to optimize a social utility using a sequence of previous and predicted observations, and a safety prioritizer is used to leverage the interpretable kinematic predictions to mask the unsafe actions, constraining the RL policy. We compare our prediction-aware AV to state-of-the-art solutions and demonstrate performance improvements in terms of efficiency and safety in multiple simulated scenarios.

Abstract: The development of athletic humanoid robots has gained significant attention as advances in actuation, sensing, and control enable increasingly dynamic, real-world capabilities. RoboCup, an international competition of fully autonomous humanoid robots, provides a uniquely challenging benchmark for such systems, culminating in the long-term goal of competing against human soccer players by 2050. This paper presents the hardware and software innovations underlying our team's victory in the RoboCup 2024 Adult-Sized Humanoid Soccer Competition. On the hardware side, we introduce an adult-sized humanoid platform built with lightweight structural components, high-torque quasi-direct-drive actuators, and a specialized foot design that enables powerful in-gait kicks while preserving locomotion robustness. On the software side, we develop an integrated perception and localization framework that combines stereo vision, object detection, and landmark-based fusion to provide reliable estimates of the ball, goals, teammates, and opponents. A mid-level navigation stack then generates collision-aware, dynamically feasible trajectories, while a centralized behavior manager coordinates high-level decision making, role selection, and kick execution based on the evolving game state. The seamless integration of these subsystems results in fast, precise, and tactically effective gameplay, enabling robust performance under the dynamic and adversarial conditions of real matches.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A sequential multi-frame loop closure verification method using SPRT to reduce false positives in LiDAR SLAM, especially in repetitive indoor environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of false positive loop closures in structurally repetitive indoor environments where single-frame descriptor comparisons often fail, by developing a more robust verification method that accumulates evidence over multiple frames.

Method: Formulates LiDAR loop closure as a truncated Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) that accumulates temporal streams of descriptor similarities between query and candidate frames, making adaptive accept/reject decisions based on user-specified error targets rather than single-frame thresholds.

Result: The sequential verifier consistently improves precision and reduces aliased loop impact across different LiDAR global descriptors compared to single-frame and heuristic multi-frame baselines, as shown on a five-sequence library dataset using segment-level K-hit precision-recall and ATE/RPE metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed descriptor-agnostic, multi-frame sequential verification approach effectively suppresses false positives in repetitive indoor environments while maintaining loop closure accuracy, offering a robust solution for LiDAR SLAM systems.

Abstract: We propose a descriptor-agnostic, multi-frame loop closure verification method that formulates LiDAR loop closure as a truncated Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT). Instead of deciding from a single descriptor comparison or using fixed thresholds with late-stage Iterative Closest Point (ICP) vetting, the verifier accumulates a short temporal stream of descriptor similarities between a query and each candidate. It then issues an accept/reject decision adaptively once sufficient multi-frame evidence has been observed, according to user-specified Type-I/II error design targets. This precision-first policy is designed to suppress false positives in structurally repetitive indoor environments. We evaluate the verifier on a five-sequence library dataset, using a fixed retrieval front-end with several representative LiDAR global descriptors. Performance is assessed via segment-level K-hit precision-recall and absolute trajectory error (ATE) and relative pose error (RPE) after pose graph optimization. Across descriptors, the sequential verifier consistently improves precision and reduces the impact of aliased loops compared with single-frame and heuristic multi-frame baselines. Our implementation and dataset will be released at: https://github.com/wanderingcar/snu_library_dataset.

Abstract: This paper addresses the movement and placement of mobile agents to establish a communication network in initially unknown environments. We cast the problem in a computational-geometric framework by relating the coverage problem and line-of-sight constraints to the Cooperative Guard Art Gallery Problem, and introduce its partially observable variant, the Partially Observable Cooperative Guard Art Gallery Problem (POCGAGP). We then present two algorithms that solve POCGAGP: CADENCE, a centralized planner that incrementally selects 270 degree corners at which to deploy agents, and DADENCE, a decentralized scheme that coordinates agents using local information and lightweight messaging. Both approaches operate under partial observability and target simultaneous coverage and connectivity. We evaluate the methods in simulation across 1,500 test cases of varied size and structure, demonstrating consistent success in forming connected networks while covering and exploring unknown space. These results highlight the value of geometric abstractions for communication-driven exploration and show that decentralized policies are competitive with centralized performance while retaining scalability.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Two-phase RL framework for drone racing in unknown cluttered environments, using soft-collision training followed by hard-collision refinement with adaptive curriculum and asymmetric architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods for drone racing focus on fixed, obstacle-free tracks but fail to generalize to unknown, cluttered environments due to challenges in balancing speed vs. collision avoidance, limited exploration space causing local optima, and perceptual ambiguity between gates and obstacles in depth maps.

Method: Two-phase learning: 1) Soft-collision training preserves policy exploration for high-speed flight, 2) Hard-collision refinement enforces robust obstacle avoidance. Uses adaptive noise-augmented curriculum with asymmetric actor-critic architecture to shift from privileged gate-state info to depth-based visual input. Adds Lipschitz constraints and track-primitive generator for stability and generalization.

Result: Achieves agile flight while robust to gate-position errors, validated through extensive simulation, ablation studies, and real-world experiments on computationally constrained quadrotor. Develops generalizable framework for diverse, partially unknown cluttered environments.

Conclusion: Proposed framework successfully addresses generalization challenges in drone racing, enabling operation in diverse, unknown cluttered environments through innovative two-phase training, adaptive curriculum, and architectural enhancements.

Abstract: Most reinforcement learning(RL)-based methods for drone racing target fixed, obstacle-free tracks, leaving the generalization to unknown, cluttered environments largely unaddressed. This challenge stems from the need to balance racing speed and collision avoidance, limited feasible space causing policy exploration trapped in local optima during training, and perceptual ambiguity between gates and obstacles in depth maps-especially when gate positions are only coarsely specified. To overcome these issues, we propose a two-phase learning framework: an initial soft-collision training phase that preserves policy exploration for high-speed flight, followed by a hard-collision refinement phase that enforces robust obstacle avoidance. An adaptive, noise-augmented curriculum with an asymmetric actor-critic architecture gradually shifts the policy's reliance from privileged gate-state information to depth-based visual input. We further impose Lipschitz constraints and integrate a track-primitive generator to enhance motion stability and cross-environment generalization. We evaluate our framework through extensive simulation and ablation studies, and validate it in real-world experiments on a computationally constrained quadrotor. The system achieves agile flight while remaining robust to gate-position errors, developing a generalizable drone racing framework with the capability to operate in diverse, partially unknown and cluttered environments. https://yufengsjtu.github.io/MasterRacing.github.io/

Abstract: Navigating complex urban environments using natural language instructions poses significant challenges for embodied agents, including noisy language instructions, ambiguous spatial references, diverse landmarks, and dynamic street scenes. Current visual navigation methods are typically limited to simulated or off-street environments, and often rely on precise goal formats, such as specific coordinates or images. This limits their effectiveness for autonomous agents like last-mile delivery robots navigating unfamiliar cities. To address these limitations, we introduce UrbanNav, a scalable framework that trains embodied agents to follow free-form language instructions in diverse urban settings. Leveraging web-scale city walking videos, we develop an scalable annotation pipeline that aligns human navigation trajectories with language instructions grounded in real-world landmarks. UrbanNav encompasses over 1,500 hours of navigation data and 3 million instruction-trajectory-landmark triplets, capturing a wide range of urban scenarios. Our model learns robust navigation policies to tackle complex urban scenarios, demonstrating superior spatial reasoning, robustness to noisy instructions, and generalization to unseen urban settings. Experimental results show that UrbanNav significantly outperforms existing methods, highlighting the potential of large-scale web video data to enable language-guided, real-world urban navigation for embodied agents.

TL;DR: Super4DR is a 4D radar-centric framework for odometry estimation and map optimization that uses cluster-aware odometry networks and 3D gaussian representations to overcome radar's sparse/noisy data limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual/LiDAR SLAM struggles in poor lighting and severe weather, while 4D radar is suited for such environments but suffers from sparse/noisy point clouds and incomplete map structures.

Method: 1) Cluster-aware odometry network using object-level cues from clustered radar points with hierarchical self-supervision (spatio-temporal consistency, knowledge transfer, feature contrast). 2) 3D gaussians as intermediate representation with radar-specific growth strategy, selective separation, and multi-view regularization to recover blurry/undetected map areas.

Result: Achieves 67% performance gain over prior self-supervised methods, nearly matches supervised odometry performance, and narrows map quality disparity with LiDAR while enabling multi-modal image rendering.

Conclusion: Super4DR effectively addresses 4D radar's limitations through learning-based odometry and gaussian-based map optimization, making radar-based SLAM viable in challenging environmental conditions.

Abstract: Conventional SLAM systems using visual or LiDAR data often struggle in poor lighting and severe weather. Although 4D radar is suited for such environments, its sparse and noisy point clouds hinder accurate odometry estimation, while the radar maps suffer from obscure and incomplete structures. Thus, we propose Super4DR, a 4D radar-centric framework for learning-based odometry estimation and gaussian-based map optimization. First, we design a cluster-aware odometry network that incorporates object-level cues from the clustered radar points for inter-frame matching, alongside a hierarchical self-supervision mechanism to overcome outliers through spatio-temporal consistency, knowledge transfer, and feature contrast. Second, we propose using 3D gaussians as an intermediate representation, coupled with a radar-specific growth strategy, selective separation, and multi-view regularization, to recover blurry map areas and those undetected based on image texture. Experiments show that Super4DR achieves a 67% performance gain over prior self-supervised methods, nearly matches supervised odometry, and narrows the map quality disparity with LiDAR while enabling multi-modal image rendering.

Motivation: Most existing VLA models rely only on RGB information and ignore crucial geometric cues needed for spatial reasoning and manipulation tasks.

Method: Introduces geometry distillation by aligning LLM's hidden states for visual tokens with features from a frozen geometry-aware vision transformer (VGGT), integrating geometric understanding into multimodal representations for action prediction.

Result: Achieves 94.1% average success rate across four LIBERO task suites, outperforming UniVLA (92.5%) which uses identical pretraining data.

Conclusion: Geometry-aware pretraining enhances spatial reasoning and policy generalization without requiring explicit depth sensors or 3D annotations.

Abstract: Most existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models rely primarily on RGB information, while ignoring geometric cues crucial for spatial reasoning and manipulation. In this work, we introduce GLaD, a geometry-aware VLA framework that incorporates 3D geometric priors during pretraining through knowledge distillation. Rather than distilling geometric features solely into the vision encoder, we align the LLM's hidden states corresponding to visual tokens with features from a frozen geometry-aware vision transformer (VGGT), ensuring that geometric understanding is deeply integrated into the multimodal representations that drive action prediction. Pretrained on the Bridge dataset with this geometry distillation mechanism, GLaD achieves 94.1% average success rate across four LIBERO task suites, outperforming UniVLA (92.5%) which uses identical pretraining data. These results validate that geometry-aware pretraining enhances spatial reasoning and policy generalization without requiring explicit depth sensors or 3D annotations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reactive control coordinates mobile manipulator motion well but lacks accurate environment representation for obstacle avoidance without expensive planning

Method: Quadratic program formulation with Gaussian Splat representation for collision avoidance, comparing geometric vs rasterisation-based distance calculation methods

Result: Achieves comparable performance to controllers using perfect ground-truth information, works in cluttered scenes with both synthetic and real-world scans

Conclusion: ReMoSPLAT enables reactive mobile manipulation with effective obstacle avoidance using efficient environment representation, balancing computational efficiency and accuracy

Abstract: Reactive control can gracefully coordinate the motion of the base and the arm of a mobile manipulator. However, incorporating an accurate representation of the environment to avoid obstacles without involving costly planning remains a challenge. In this work, we present ReMoSPLAT, a reactive controller based on a quadratic program formulation for mobile manipulation that leverages a Gaussian Splat representation for collision avoidance. By integrating additional constraints and costs into the optimisation formulation, a mobile manipulator platform can reach its intended end effector pose while avoiding obstacles, even in cluttered scenes. We investigate the trade-offs of two methods for efficiently calculating robot-obstacle distances, comparing a purely geometric approach with a rasterisation-based approach. Our experiments in simulation on both synthetic and real-world scans demonstrate the feasibility of our method, showing that the proposed approach achieves performance comparable to controllers that rely on perfect ground-truth information.

Conclusion: Combining simultaneous multimodal perception with modern learning frameworks enables more precise and adaptable robotic manipulation, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrated sensor and learning system design.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation requires both rich multimodal perception and effective learning frameworks to handle complex real-world tasks. See-through-skin (STS) sensors, which combine tactile and visual perception, offer promising sensing capabilities, while modern imitation learning provides powerful tools for policy acquisition. However, existing STS designs lack simultaneous multimodal perception and suffer from unreliable tactile tracking. Furthermore, integrating these rich multimodal signals into learning-based manipulation pipelines remains an open challenge. We introduce TacThru, an STS sensor enabling simultaneous visual perception and robust tactile signal extraction, and TacThru-UMI, an imitation learning framework that leverages these multimodal signals for manipulation. Our sensor features a fully transparent elastomer, persistent illumination, novel keyline markers, and efficient tracking, while our learning system integrates these signals through a Transformer-based Diffusion Policy. Experiments on five challenging real-world tasks show that TacThru-UMI achieves an average success rate of 85.5%, significantly outperforming the baselines of alternating tactile-visual (66.3%) and vision-only (55.4%). The system excels in critical scenarios, including contact detection with thin and soft objects and precision manipulation requiring multimodal coordination. This work demonstrates that combining simultaneous multimodal perception with modern learning frameworks enables more precise, adaptable robotic manipulation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time UAV-UGV coordination is challenging without GPS/GNSS infrastructure, especially for search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and logistics applications that require precise platform integration.

Method: Fine-tuned YOLOv5 model detects UGVs and extracts bounding box features, then a lightweight ANN uses these features to predict UAV heading angle. Training used VICON motion capture for ground-truth data (13,000+ annotated images).

Result: 95% UGV detection accuracy, heading angle prediction with MAE of 0.1506° and RMSE of 0.1957°, demonstrating real-time performance with only monocular camera inputs.

Conclusion: The vision-based, infrastructure-independent solution shows strong potential for GPS/GNSS-denied environments, enabling reliable multi-agent coordination under dynamic conditions.

Abstract: The integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) is increasingly central to the development of intelligent autonomous systems for applications such as search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and logistics. However, precise coordination between these platforms in real-time scenarios presents major challenges, particularly when external localization infrastructure such as GPS or GNSS is unavailable or degraded [1]. This paper proposes a vision-based, data-driven framework for real-time UAV-UGV integration, with a focus on robust UGV detection and heading angle prediction for navigation and coordination. The system employs a fine-tuned YOLOv5 model to detect UGVs and extract bounding box features, which are then used by a lightweight artificial neural network (ANN) to estimate the UAV's required heading angle. A VICON motion capture system was used to generate ground-truth data during training, resulting in a dataset of over 13,000 annotated images collected in a controlled lab environment. The trained ANN achieves a mean absolute error of 0.1506° and a root mean squared error of 0.1957°, offering accurate heading angle predictions using only monocular camera inputs. Experimental evaluations achieve 95% accuracy in UGV detection. This work contributes a vision-based, infrastructure- independent solution that demonstrates strong potential for deployment in GPS/GNSS-denied environments, supporting reliable multi-agent coordination under realistic dynamic conditions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional robotic navigation requires computationally expensive 3D mapping. Visual navigation offers an alternative, but needs efficient scene representation. Exploration videos provide visual references for navigation without detailed metric maps.

Method: Hierarchical framework: 1) Visual place recognition for coarse localization, 2) Local 3D Gaussian Splatting models for pose refinement, 3) Action prediction to guide robot back to demonstrated trajectories. Encodes environment into compact spatial representation of interconnected 3DGS models.

Result: Excellent performance in image-goal navigation on real-world scenes using Clearpath Jackal robot. Introduced YOPO-Campus dataset with 4 hours of egocentric video and 6+ km of human-teleoperated trajectories for benchmarking.

Conclusion: YOPO-Nav provides effective visual navigation using exploration videos as reference, eliminating need for traditional metric maps. The approach and dataset advance visual navigation and scene representation research.

Abstract: Visual navigation has emerged as a practical alternative to traditional robotic navigation pipelines that rely on detailed mapping and path planning. However, constructing and maintaining 3D maps is often computationally expensive and memory-intensive. We address the problem of visual navigation when exploration videos of a large environment are available. The videos serve as a visual reference, allowing a robot to retrace the explored trajectories without relying on metric maps. Our proposed method, YOPO-Nav (You Only Pass Once), encodes an environment into a compact spatial representation composed of interconnected local 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models. During navigation, the framework aligns the robot's current visual observation with this representation and predicts actions that guide it back toward the demonstrated trajectory. YOPO-Nav employs a hierarchical design: a visual place recognition (VPR) module provides coarse localization, while the local 3DGS models refine the goal and intermediate poses to generate control actions. To evaluate our approach, we introduce the YOPO-Campus dataset, comprising 4 hours of egocentric video and robot controller inputs from over 6 km of human-teleoperated robot trajectories. We benchmark recent visual navigation methods on trajectories from YOPO-Campus using a Clearpath Jackal robot. Experimental results show YOPO-Nav provides excellent performance in image-goal navigation for real-world scenes on a physical robot. The dataset and code will be made publicly available for visual navigation and scene representation research.

Abstract: High-fidelity simulation has become essential to the design and control of soft robots, where large geometric deformations and complex contact interactions challenge conventional modeling tools. Recent advances in the field demand simulation frameworks that combine physical accuracy, computational scalability, and seamless integration with modern control and optimization pipelines. In this work, we present Py-DiSMech, a Python-based, open-source simulation framework for modeling and control of soft robotic structures grounded in the principles of Discrete Differential Geometry (DDG).

Method: Proposes LISN-Bench benchmark built on Rosnav-Arena 3.0, and Social-Nav-Modulator - a fast-slow hierarchical system where a VLM agent modulates costmaps and controller parameters, decoupling low-level action generation from slower VLM inference.

Result: Achieves 91.3% average success rate, which is 63% higher than the most competitive baseline, with significant improvements in challenging tasks like following a person in crowds and navigating while avoiding instruction-forbidden regions.

Conclusion: LISN-Bench establishes the first standardized benchmark for language-instructed social navigation, and the proposed hierarchical approach effectively combines language understanding with real-time navigation while reducing computational demands.

Abstract: Towards human-robot coexistence, socially aware navigation is significant for mobile robots. Yet existing studies on this area focus mainly on path efficiency and pedestrian collision avoidance, which are essential but represent only a fraction of social navigation. Beyond these basics, robots must also comply with user instructions, aligning their actions to task goals and social norms expressed by humans. In this work, we present LISN-Bench, the first simulation-based benchmark for language-instructed social navigation. Built on Rosnav-Arena 3.0, it is the first standardized social navigation benchmark to incorporate instruction following and scene understanding across diverse contexts. To address this task, we further propose Social-Nav-Modulator, a fast-slow hierarchical system where a VLM agent modulates costmaps and controller parameters. Decoupling low-level action generation from the slower VLM loop reduces reliance on high-frequency VLM inference while improving dynamic avoidance and perception adaptability. Our method achieves an average success rate of 91.3%, which is greater than 63% than the most competitive baseline, with most of the improvements observed in challenging tasks such as following a person in a crowd and navigating while strictly avoiding instruction-forbidden regions.

Conclusion: TEAM-VLA achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness for VLA models without retraining, enabling faster real-time robotic perception and control.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models pretrained on large-scale multimodal datasets have emerged as powerful foundations for robotic perception and control. However, their massive scale, often billions of parameters, poses significant challenges for real-time deployment, as inference becomes computationally expensive and latency-sensitive in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose Token Expand-and-Merge-VLA (TEAM-VLA), a training-free token compression framework that accelerates VLA inference while preserving task performance. TEAM-VLA introduces a dynamic token expansion mechanism that identifies and samples additional informative tokens in the spatial vicinity of attention-highlighted regions, enhancing contextual completeness. These expanded tokens are then selectively merged in deeper layers under action-aware guidance, effectively reducing redundancy while maintaining semantic coherence. By coupling expansion and merging within a single feed-forward pass, TEAM-VLA achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness, without any retraining or parameter updates. Extensive experiments on LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that TEAM-VLA consistently improves inference speed while maintaining or even surpassing the task success rate of full VLA models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models assume Markov property, relying only on current observations, which causes temporal myopia and degrades long-horizon coherence in robotic manipulation tasks.

Method: HiF-VLA uses motion as compact temporal representation, encoding past dynamics through hindsight priors, anticipating future motion via foresight reasoning, and integrating both through a hindsight-modulated joint expert for "think-while-acting" paradigm.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines on LIBERO-Long and CALVIN ABC-D benchmarks with negligible additional inference latency, and achieves substantial improvements in real-world long-horizon manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: Motion-based bidirectional temporal reasoning effectively addresses temporal myopia in VLA models, enabling robust long-horizon manipulation with practical effectiveness in real-world robotic settings.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently enabled robotic manipulation by grounding visual and linguistic cues into actions. However, most VLAs assume the Markov property, relying only on the current observation and thus suffering from temporal myopia that degrades long-horizon coherence. In this work, we view motion as a more compact and informative representation of temporal context and world dynamics, capturing inter-state changes while filtering static pixel-level noise. Building on this idea, we propose HiF-VLA (Hindsight, Insight, and Foresight for VLAs), a unified framework that leverages motion for bidirectional temporal reasoning. HiF-VLA encodes past dynamics through hindsight priors, anticipates future motion via foresight reasoning, and integrates both through a hindsight-modulated joint expert to enable a ''think-while-acting'' paradigm for long-horizon manipulation. As a result, HiF-VLA surpasses strong baselines on LIBERO-Long and CALVIN ABC-D benchmarks, while incurring negligible additional inference latency. Furthermore, HiF-VLA achieves substantial improvements in real-world long-horizon manipulation tasks, demonstrating its broad effectiveness in practical robotic settings.
