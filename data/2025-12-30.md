### [1] [Characterizing Motion Encoding in Video Diffusion Timesteps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22175)
*Vatsal Baherwani,Yixuan Ren,Abhinav Shrivastava*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper systematically analyzes how motion is encoded across timesteps in text-to-video diffusion models, identifying distinct motion-dominant and appearance-dominant regimes, and proposes a simplified motion customization method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While practitioners use the heuristic that early timesteps shape motion/layout and later ones refine appearance, this behavior hasn't been systematically characterized. The paper aims to understand how motion is encoded across diffusion timesteps.

Method: Proxies motion encoding by measuring the trade-off between appearance editing and motion preservation when injecting new conditions over specific timestep ranges. Conducts large-scale quantitative study across diverse architectures to map how motion and appearance compete along the denoising trajectory.

Result: Consistently identifies an early motion-dominant regime and later appearance-dominant regime across architectures, establishing an operational motion-appearance boundary in timestep space. Shows that restricting training/inference to motion-dominant regime simplifies motion customization without needing debiasing modules.

Conclusion: Turns the widely used heuristic into a spatiotemporal disentanglement principle. The timestep-constrained recipe can be easily integrated into existing motion transfer and editing methods, providing a principled approach to motion customization.

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models synthesize temporal motion and spatial appearance through iterative denoising, yet how motion is encoded across timesteps remains poorly understood. Practitioners often exploit the empirical heuristic that early timesteps mainly shape motion and layout while later ones refine appearance, but this behavior has not been systematically characterized. In this work, we proxy motion encoding in video diffusion timesteps by the trade-off between appearance editing and motion preservation induced when injecting new conditions over specified timestep ranges, and characterize this proxy through a large-scale quantitative study. This protocol allows us to factor motion from appearance by quantitatively mapping how they compete along the denoising trajectory. Across diverse architectures, we consistently identify an early, motion-dominant regime and a later, appearance-dominant regime, yielding an operational motion-appearance boundary in timestep space. Building on this characterization, we simplify current one-shot motion customization paradigm by restricting training and inference to the motion-dominant regime, achieving strong motion transfer without auxiliary debiasing modules or specialized objectives. Our analysis turns a widely used heuristic into a spatiotemporal disentanglement principle, and our timestep-constrained recipe can serve as ready integration into existing motion transfer and editing methods.

### [4] [Unbiased Visual Reasoning with Controlled Visual Inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22183)
*Zhaonan Li,Shijie Lu,Fei Wang,Jacob Dineen,Xiao Ye,Zhikun Xu,Siyi Liu,Young Min Cho,Bangzheng Li,Daniel Chang,Kenny Nguyen,Qizheng Yang,Muhao Chen,Ben Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISTA is a modular framework that separates perception from reasoning in vision-language models to reduce shortcut learning and improve robustness to spurious correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end VLMs often exploit spurious correlations instead of causal visual evidence, becoming more shortcut-prone when fine-tuned, which undermines robust visual reasoning.

Method: VISTA decouples perception from reasoning using an information bottleneck: a frozen VLM sensor provides short, objective perception queries, while a text-only LLM reasoner decomposes questions, plans queries, and aggregates visual facts in natural language. The framework is trained with reinforcement learning (GRPO) using only 641 curated multi-step questions.

Result: VISTA significantly improves robustness to real-world spurious correlations on SpuriVerse (+16.29% with Qwen-2.5-VL-7B and +6.77% with Llama-3.2-Vision-11B), remains competitive on MMVP and balanced SeedBench, transfers robustly across unseen VLM sensors, and can recognize/recover from VLM perception failures.

Conclusion: The modular VISTA framework effectively reduces shortcut learning in VLMs by separating perception from reasoning, creating more neutral, less spurious, and better-grounded visual reasoning compared to end-to-end baselines.

Abstract: End-to-end Vision-language Models (VLMs) often answer visual questions by exploiting spurious correlations instead of causal visual evidence, and can become more shortcut-prone when fine-tuned. We introduce VISTA (Visual-Information Separation for Text-based Analysis), a modular framework that decouples perception from reasoning via an explicit information bottleneck. A frozen VLM sensor is restricted to short, objective perception queries, while a text-only LLM reasoner decomposes each question, plans queries, and aggregates visual facts in natural language. This controlled interface defines a reward-aligned environment for training unbiased visual reasoning with reinforcement learning. Instantiated with Qwen2.5-VL and Llama3.2-Vision sensors, and trained with GRPO from only 641 curated multi-step questions, VISTA significantly improves robustness to real-world spurious correlations on SpuriVerse (+16.29% with Qwen-2.5-VL-7B and +6.77% with Llama-3.2-Vision-11B), while remaining competitive on MMVP and a balanced SeedBench subset. VISTA transfers robustly across unseen VLM sensors and is able to recognize and recover from VLM perception failures. Human analysis further shows that VISTA's reasoning traces are more neutral, less reliant on spurious attributes, and more explicitly grounded in visual evidence than end-to-end VLM baselines.

### [5] [SAMM2D: Scale-Aware Multi-Modal 2D Dual-Encoder for High-Sensitivity Intracrania Aneurysm Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22185)
*Antara Titikhsha,Divyanshu Tak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAMM2D achieves 32% AUC improvement for aneurysm detection, but surprisingly shows that data augmentation harms performance when using strong pretrained backbones, challenging conventional wisdom in medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aneurysm detection is challenging due to subtle morphology, class imbalance, and scarce annotated data. Current methods need improvement to prevent life-threatening hemorrhages.

Method: SAMM2D dual-encoder framework using ImageNet-pretrained backbone without data augmentation, with decision threshold calibration and Grad-CAM visualizations for interpretability.

Result: Achieved 0.686 AUC (32% improvement over baseline), 95% sensitivity surpassing radiologists, $13.9M projected savings per 1,000 patients, and 85% true positives attending to relevant vascular regions.

Conclusion: Strong pretraining is more beneficial than complex augmentation in low-data medical settings, overturning the "more augmentation is always better" assumption.

Abstract: Effective aneurysm detection is essential to avert life-threatening hemorrhages, but it remains challenging due to the subtle morphology of the aneurysm, pronounced class imbalance, and the scarcity of annotated data. We introduce SAMM2D, a dual-encoder framework that achieves an AUC of 0.686 on the RSNA intracranial aneurysm dataset; an improvement of 32% over the clinical baseline. In a comprehensive ablation across six augmentation regimes, we made a striking discovery: any form of data augmentation degraded performance when coupled with a strong pretrained backbone. Our unaugmented baseline model outperformed all augmented variants by 1.75--2.23 percentage points (p < 0.01), overturning the assumption that "more augmentation is always better" in low-data medical settings. We hypothesize that ImageNet-pretrained features already capture robust invariances, rendering additional augmentations both redundant and disruptive to the learned feature manifold. By calibrating the decision threshold, SAMM2D reaches 95% sensitivity, surpassing average radiologist performance, and translates to a projected \$13.9M in savings per 1,000 patients in screening applications. Grad-CAM visualizations confirm that 85% of true positives attend to relevant vascular regions (62% IoU with expert annotations), demonstrating the model's clinically meaningful focus. Our results suggest that future medical imaging workflows could benefit more from strong pretraining than from increasingly complex augmentation pipelines.

### [6] [HookMIL: Revisiting Context Modeling in Multiple Instance Learning for Computational Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22188)
*Xitong Ling,Minxi Ouyang,Xiaoxiao Li,Jiawen Li,Ying Chen,Yuxuan Sun,Xinrui Chen,Tian Guan,Xiaoping Liu,Yonghong He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HookMIL is a context-aware Multiple Instance Learning framework for computational pathology that uses learnable hook tokens for efficient contextual aggregation with linear complexity, achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MIL approaches lose crucial contextual information in whole-slide images, while transformer-based variants suffer from quadratic complexity and redundant computations, limiting their practical application in computational pathology.

Method: Proposes HookMIL with compact learnable hook tokens that can be initialized from three sources: key-patch visual features, text embeddings from vision-language models, and spatially grounded features from spatial transcriptomics-vision models. Uses bidirectional attention with linear complexity, Hook Diversity Loss for specialization, and hook-to-hook communication mechanism.

Result: Extensive experiments on four public pathology datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with improved computational efficiency and interpretability compared to existing MIL approaches.

Conclusion: HookMIL provides an effective solution for weakly supervised analysis of whole-slide images by balancing contextual awareness with computational efficiency through innovative hook token design and multimodal initialization strategies.

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has enabled weakly supervised analysis of whole-slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology. However, traditional MIL approaches often lose crucial contextual information, while transformer-based variants, though more expressive, suffer from quadratic complexity and redundant computations. To address these limitations, we propose HookMIL, a context-aware and computationally efficient MIL framework that leverages compact, learnable hook tokens for structured contextual aggregation. These tokens can be initialized from (i) key-patch visual features, (ii) text embeddings from vision-language pathology models, and (iii) spatially grounded features from spatial transcriptomics-vision models. This multimodal initialization enables Hook Tokens to incorporate rich textual and spatial priors, accelerating convergence and enhancing representation quality. During training, Hook tokens interact with instances through bidirectional attention with linear complexity. To further promote specialization, we introduce a Hook Diversity Loss that encourages each token to focus on distinct histopathological patterns. Additionally, a hook-to-hook communication mechanism refines contextual interactions while minimizing redundancy. Extensive experiments on four public pathology datasets demonstrate that HookMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improved computational efficiency and interpretability.

### [7] [Tiny-YOLOSAM: Fast Hybrid Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22193)
*Kenneth Xu,Songhan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Tiny-YOLOSAM combines YOLOv12 detection with TinySAM for faster full-scene segmentation, achieving 4.7x speedup while improving coverage metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM and TinySAM are computationally expensive for latency-critical applications, especially in "segment-everything" mode requiring hundreds of prompts.

Method: Hybrid pipeline using YOLOv12 to generate box prompts for salient objects, supplemented with sparse point prompts only in uncovered regions where YOLO-guided masks don't provide coverage.

Result: On COCO val2017: AR improved from 16.4% to 77.1%, mIoU from 19.2% to 67.8%, runtime reduced from 49.20s/image to 10.39s/image (4.7x speedup) on Apple M1 Pro CPU.

Conclusion: Detector-guided prompting with targeted sparse sampling is an effective alternative to dense "segment-everything" prompting for practical full-scene segmentation.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) enables promptable, high-quality segmentation but is often too computationally expensive for latency-critical settings. TinySAM is a lightweight, distilled SAM variant that preserves strong zero-shot mask quality, yet its "segment-everything" mode still requires hundreds of prompts and remains slow in practice. We first replicate TinySAM on COCO val2017 using official checkpoints, matching the reported AP within 0.03%, establishing a reliable experimental baseline. Building on this, we propose Tiny-YOLOSAM, a fast hybrid pipeline that uses a recent YOLO detector (YOLOv12) to generate box prompts for TinySAM on salient foreground objects, and supplements uncovered regions with sparse point prompts sampled only where YOLO-guided masks provide no coverage. On COCO val2017, the hybrid system substantially improves class-agnostic coverage (AR from 16.4% to 77.1%, mIoU from 19.2% to 67.8%) while reducing end-to-end runtime from 49.20s/image to 10.39s/image (4.7x) on an Apple M1 Pro CPU. These results suggest detector-guided prompting combined with targeted sparse sampling as an effective alternative to dense "segment-everything" prompting for practical full-scene segmentation.

### [8] [Quadrant Segmentation VLM with Few-Shot Adaptation and OCT Learning-based Explainability Methods for Diabetic Retinopathy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22197)
*Shivum Telang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel multimodal explainability model using VLM with few-shot learning generates Grad-CAM heatmaps for both OCT and fundus images to explain DR severity classification like an ophthalmologist.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models for DR detection lack practical explainability - they either require impractical manual lesion annotation or provide limited one-dimensional explanations. Physicians need models that explain reasoning for classifications, not just highlight lesions.

Method: Multimodal explainability model using Vision-Language Model (VLM) with few-shot learning that analyzes lesion distributions within retinal quadrants. Generates paired Grad-CAM heatmaps showing individual neuron weights across both OCT and fundus images.

Result: Model developed using dataset of 3,000 fundus images and 1,000 OCT images. Provides visual highlighting of regions contributing to DR severity classification, addressing limitations in current DR diagnostics.

Conclusion: The innovative methodology offers a practical and comprehensive tool for improving patient outcomes in DR screening, treatment, and research by providing multimodal explainability that mimics ophthalmologist reasoning.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss worldwide, requiring early detection to preserve sight. Limited access to physicians often leaves DR undiagnosed. To address this, AI models utilize lesion segmentation for interpretability; however, manually annotating lesions is impractical for clinicians. Physicians require a model that explains the reasoning for classifications rather than just highlighting lesion locations. Furthermore, current models are one-dimensional, relying on a single imaging modality for explainability and achieving limited effectiveness. In contrast, a quantitative-detection system that identifies individual DR lesions in natural language would overcome these limitations, enabling diverse applications in screening, treatment, and research settings. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel multimodal explainability model utilizing a VLM with few-shot learning, which mimics an ophthalmologist's reasoning by analyzing lesion distributions within retinal quadrants for fundus images. The model generates paired Grad-CAM heatmaps, showcasing individual neuron weights across both OCT and fundus images, which visually highlight the regions contributing to DR severity classification. Using a dataset of 3,000 fundus images and 1,000 OCT images, this innovative methodology addresses key limitations in current DR diagnostics, offering a practical and comprehensive tool for improving patient outcomes.

### [9] [TCFormer: A 5M-Parameter Transformer with Density-Guided Aggregation for Weakly-Supervised Crowd Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22203)
*Qiang Guo,Rubo Zhang,Bingbing Zhang,Junjie Liu,Jianqing Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TCFormer is a tiny 5M-parameter transformer-based crowd counting model that achieves competitive performance using only image-level count labels, making it suitable for edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional crowd counting requires labor-intensive point annotations and computationally heavy models, limiting scalability and deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Method: Uses a lightweight vision transformer as feature extractor, adds a Learnable Density-Weighted Averaging module to re-weight local tokens based on predicted density, and introduces a density-level classification loss for regularization.

Result: Achieves superior trade-off between parameter efficiency and counting accuracy on ShanghaiTech A/B, UCF-QNRF, and NWPU benchmarks with only 5M parameters.

Conclusion: TCFormer provides an effective weakly-supervised solution for crowd counting that balances accuracy and efficiency, making it suitable for edge device deployment.

Abstract: Crowd counting typically relies on labor-intensive point-level annotations and computationally intensive backbones, restricting its scalability and deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the TCFormer, a tiny, ultra-lightweight, weakly-supervised transformer-based crowd counting framework with only 5 million parameters that achieves competitive performance. Firstly, a powerful yet efficient vision transformer is adopted as the feature extractor, the global context-aware capabilities of which provides semantic meaningful crowd features with a minimal memory footprint. Secondly, to compensate for the lack of spatial supervision, we design a feature aggregation mechanism termed the Learnable Density-Weighted Averaging module. This module dynamically re-weights local tokens according to predicted density scores, enabling the network to adaptively modulate regional features based on their specific density characteristics without the need for additional annotations. Furthermore, this paper introduces a density-level classification loss, which discretizes crowd density into distinct grades, thereby regularizing the training process and enhancing the model's classification power across varying levels of crowd density. Therefore, although TCformer is trained under a weakly-supervised paradigm utilizing only image-level global counts, the joint optimization of count and density-level losses enables the framework to achieve high estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks including ShanghaiTech A/B, UCF-QNRF, and NWPU datasets demonstrate that our approach strikes a superior trade-off between parameter efficiency and counting accuracy and can be a good solution for crowd counting tasks in edge devices.

Method: Custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for automatic classification of blood cell images as parasitized or uninfected, compared with ResNet50, VGG16, MobileNetV2, and DenseNet121, enhanced with SHAP, LIME, and Saliency Maps for explainability.

Result: Model achieves 96% accuracy with precision and recall exceeding 0.95 for both classes, demonstrating superior performance over established architectures.

Conclusion: Deep learning provides quick, accurate, and understandable malaria diagnosis suitable for resource-limited areas, with explainable AI enhancing clinical trust and adoption.

Abstract: Malaria remains a prevalent health concern in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. The cause of malaria is the Plasmodium parasite, which is transmitted through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as microscopic blood smear analysis, are low in sensitivity, depend on expert judgment, and require resources that may not be available in remote settings. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a deep learning-based approach utilizing a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically classify blood cell images as parasitized or uninfected. The model achieves an accuracy of 96%, with precision and recall scores exceeding 0.95 for both classes. This study also compares the custom CNN with established deep learning architectures, including ResNet50, VGG16, MobileNetV2, and DenseNet121. To enhance model interpretability, Explainable AI techniques such as SHAP, LIME, and Saliency Maps are applied. The proposed system shows how deep learning can provide quick, accurate and understandable malaria diagnosis, especially in areas with limited resources.

*Naichuan Zheng,Xiahai Lun,Weiyi Li,Yuchen Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Signal-SGN++ is a spiking graph neural network that combines topology-aware attention with time-frequency spiking dynamics for energy-efficient action recognition, achieving competitive accuracy with GCNs at much lower energy costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GCNs are effective for skeletal action recognition but energy-intensive due to dense floating-point computations. SNNs offer energy efficiency but struggle to capture the coupled temporal-frequency and topological dependencies of human motion. There's a need to bridge this gap with an energy-efficient solution that maintains strong topological modeling capabilities.

Method: Proposes Signal-SGN++ with: 1) 1D Spiking Graph Convolution (1D-SGC) and Frequency Spiking Convolution (FSC) for joint spatiotemporal and spectral feature extraction; 2) Topology-Shift Self-Attention (TSSA) to adaptively route attention across learned skeletal topologies; 3) Multi-Scale Wavelet Transform Fusion (MWTF) branch with Topology-Aware Time-Frequency Fusion (TATF) unit for multi-resolution temporal-frequency representations with structural priors.

Result: Achieves superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, outperforms existing SNN-based methods, and achieves competitive results against state-of-the-art GCNs while substantially reducing energy consumption on large-scale benchmarks.

Conclusion: Signal-SGN++ successfully bridges the gap between energy-efficient SNNs and topology-aware GCNs by integrating structural adaptivity with time-frequency spiking dynamics, offering a promising solution for energy-efficient action recognition without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) demonstrate strong capability in modeling skeletal topology for action recognition, yet their dense floating-point computations incur high energy costs. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), characterized by event-driven and sparse activation, offer energy efficiency but remain limited in capturing coupled temporal-frequency and topological dependencies of human motion. To bridge this gap, this article proposes Signal-SGN++, a topology-aware spiking graph framework that integrates structural adaptivity with time-frequency spiking dynamics. The network employs a backbone composed of 1D Spiking Graph Convolution (1D-SGC) and Frequency Spiking Convolution (FSC) for joint spatiotemporal and spectral feature extraction. Within this backbone, a Topology-Shift Self-Attention (TSSA) mechanism is embedded to adaptively route attention across learned skeletal topologies, enhancing graph-level sensitivity without increasing computational complexity. Moreover, an auxiliary Multi-Scale Wavelet Transform Fusion (MWTF) branch decomposes spiking features into multi-resolution temporal-frequency representations, wherein a Topology-Aware Time-Frequency Fusion (TATF) unit incorporates structural priors to preserve topology-consistent spectral fusion. Comprehensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks validate that Signal-SGN++ achieves superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, outperforming existing SNN-based methods and achieving competitive results against state-of-the-art GCNs under substantially reduced energy consumption.

Abstract: Understanding signboard text in natural scenes is essential for real-world applications of Visual Question Answering (VQA), yet remains underexplored, particularly in low-resource languages. We introduce ViSignVQA, the first large-scale Vietnamese dataset designed for signboard-oriented VQA, which comprises 10,762 images and 25,573 question-answer pairs.

The experimental results highlight the significant role of the OCR-enhanced context, with F1-score improvements of up to 209% when the OCR text is appended to questions. Additionally, we propose a multi-agent VQA framework combining perception and reasoning agents with GPT-4, achieving 75.98% accuracy via majority voting. Our study presents the first large-scale multimodal dataset for Vietnamese signboard understanding. This underscores the importance of domain-specific resources in enhancing text-based VQA for low-resource languages. ViSignVQA serves as a benchmark capturing real-world scene text characteristics and supporting the development and evaluation of OCR-integrated VQA models in Vietnamese.

### [14] [On Extending Semantic Abstraction for Efficient Search of Hidden Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22220)
*Tasha Pais,Nikhilesh Belulkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Semantic Abstraction uses 2D VLM relevancy maps as "abstract object" representations to learn 3D localization and completion for hidden objects, enabling faster search than random methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable household robots to efficiently find lost objects that are hidden or occluded, saving time and effort compared to naive random search approaches.

Method: Uses 2D Vision-Language Models' relevancy activation maps as abstract object representations, learns 3D localization and completion for hidden objects, and leverages historical placement data for more efficient unstructured search.

Result: The model can accurately identify complete 3D locations of hidden objects on the first try significantly faster than naive random search approaches.

Conclusion: Semantic Abstraction extensions provide household robots with skills to efficiently locate lost objects by leveraging VLM relevancy maps and historical data for faster hidden object discovery.

Abstract: Semantic Abstraction's key observation is that 2D VLMs' relevancy activations roughly correspond to their confidence of whether and where an object is in the scene. Thus, relevancy maps are treated as "abstract object" representations. We use this framework for learning 3D localization and completion for the exclusive domain of hidden objects, defined as objects that cannot be directly identified by a VLM because they are at least partially occluded. This process of localizing hidden objects is a form of unstructured search that can be performed more efficiently using historical data of where an object is frequently placed. Our model can accurately identify the complete 3D location of a hidden object on the first try significantly faster than a naive random search. These extensions to semantic abstraction hope to provide household robots with the skills necessary to save time and effort when looking for lost objects.

*Naishan Zheng,Jie Huang,Qingpei Guo,Feng Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoScaffold is a dynamic representation framework for streaming video understanding that adaptively adjusts event granularity while preserving visual semantics, achieving SOTA performance on video benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing static strategies for video understanding (sparse sampling, frame compression, clustering) are optimized for offline settings and produce fragmented or over-compressed outputs when applied to continuous video streams, failing to handle temporal coherence and redundancy effectively.

Method: VideoScaffold introduces two key components: 1) Elastic-Scale Event Segmentation (EES) for prediction-guided dynamic refinement of event boundaries, and 2) Hierarchical Event Consolidation (HEC) for progressive aggregation of semantically related segments into multi-level abstractions, enabling smooth transition from frame-level to event-level understanding.

Result: Extensive experiments across both offline and streaming video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that VideoScaffold achieves state-of-the-art performance. The framework is modular and plug-and-play, seamlessly extending existing image-based MLLMs to continuous video comprehension.

Conclusion: VideoScaffold provides an effective dynamic representation framework for streaming video understanding that addresses the limitations of static approaches, enabling adaptive event granularity adjustment while preserving fine-grained semantics for improved multimodal video comprehension.

Abstract: Understanding long videos with multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains challenging due to the heavy redundancy across frames and the need for temporally coherent representations. Existing static strategies, such as sparse sampling, frame compression, and clustering, are optimized for offline settings and often produce fragmented or over-compressed outputs when applied to continuous video streams. We present VideoScaffold, a dynamic representation framework designed for streaming video understanding. It adaptively adjusts event granularity according to video duration while preserving fine-grained visual semantics. VideoScaffold introduces two key components: Elastic-Scale Event Segmentation (EES), which performs prediction-guided segmentation to dynamically refine event boundaries, and Hierarchical Event Consolidation (HEC), which progressively aggregates semantically related segments into multi-level abstractions. Working in concert, EES and HEC enable VideoScaffold to transition smoothly from fine-grained frame understanding to abstract event reasoning as the video stream unfolds. Extensive experiments across both offline and streaming video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that VideoScaffold achieves state-of-the-art performance. The framework is modular and plug-and-play, seamlessly extending existing image-based MLLMs to continuous video comprehension. The code is available at https://github.com/zheng980629/VideoScaffold.

### [16] [KAN-FPN-Stem:A KAN-Enhanced Feature Pyramid Stem for Boosting ViT-based Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22228)
*HaoNan Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KAN-FPN-Stem improves ViT-based pose estimation by replacing FPN's final linear convolution with KAN-based layer for better non-linear fusion, achieving +2.0 AP gain on COCO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ViT front-ends for pose estimation (like ViTPose) use simplistic patchification that causes irreversible information loss and struggles with multi-scale variations, limiting performance.

Method: Retain FPN's "upsample-and-add" fusion but replace terminal 3x3 linear convolution with KAN-based convolutional layer that adaptively learns and rectifies fusion artifacts using superior non-linear modeling.

Result: Achieves significant performance boost of up to +2.0 AP over ViTPose-S baseline on COCO dataset, demonstrating effectiveness of KAN-enhanced fusion.

Conclusion: Performance bottleneck in ViT front-ends lies in feature fusion quality rather than feature refinement (attention), and KAN operators provide effective solution for this bottleneck.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViT) have demonstrated significant promise in dense prediction tasks such as pose estimation. However, their performance is frequently constrained by the overly simplistic front-end designs employed in models like ViTPose. This naive patchification mechanism struggles to effectively handle multi-scale variations and results in irreversible information loss during the initial feature extraction phase. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel KAN-enhanced FPN-Stem architecture. Through rigorous ablation studies, we first identified that the true bottleneck for performance improvement lies not in plug-and-play attention modules (e.g., CBAM), but in the post-fusion non-linear smoothing step within the FPN. Guided by this insight, our core innovation is to retain the classic "upsample-and-add" fusion stream of the FPN, but replace its terminal, standard linear 3x3 smoothing convolution with a powerful KAN-based convolutional layer. Leveraging its superior non-linear modeling capabilities, this KAN-based layer adaptively learns and rectifies the "artifacts" generated during the multi-scale fusion process. Extensive experiments on the COCO dataset demonstrate that our KAN-FPN-Stem achieves a significant performance boost of up to +2.0 AP over the lightweight ViTPose-S baseline. This work not only delivers a plug-and-play, high-performance module but, more importantly, reveals that: the performance bottleneck in ViT front-end often lies not in 'feature refinement' (Attention), but in the quality of 'feature fusion' (Fusion). Furthermore, it provides an effective path to address this bottleneck through the introduction of the KAN operator.

TL;DR: MiG-DM: A meta-information guided cross-domain synergistic diffusion model that integrates patient-specific clinical parameters and projection-domain physics to generate high-quality low-dose PET images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-dose PET imaging reduces patient radiation exposure but suffers from noise, reduced contrast, and difficulty preserving physiological details. Existing methods neglect both projection-domain physics knowledge and patient-specific meta-information needed for functional-semantic correlation mining.

Method: MiG-DM integrates cross-modal priors through: 1) meta-information encoding module that transforms clinical parameters into semantic prompts considering patient characteristics, dose info, and semi-quantitative parameters; 2) cross-domain architecture combining projection-domain and image-domain processing with a specialized sinogram adapter capturing global physical structures.

Result: Experiments on UDPET public dataset and clinical datasets with varying dose levels show MiG-DM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in enhancing PET image quality and preserving physiological details.

Conclusion: The proposed MiG-DM successfully integrates patient-specific meta-information and projection-domain physics knowledge to address limitations of low-dose PET imaging, demonstrating superior performance in image quality enhancement and physiological detail preservation.

Abstract: Low-dose PET imaging is crucial for reducing patient radiation exposure but faces challenges like noise interference, reduced contrast, and difficulty in preserving physiological details. Existing methods often neglect both projection-domain physics knowledge and patient-specific meta-information, which are critical for functional-semantic correlation mining. In this study, we introduce a meta-information guided cross-domain synergistic diffusion model (MiG-DM) that integrates comprehensive cross-modal priors to generate high-quality PET images. Specifically, a meta-information encoding module transforms clinical parameters into semantic prompts by considering patient characteristics, dose-related information, and semi-quantitative parameters, enabling cross-modal alignment between textual meta-information and image reconstruction. Additionally, the cross-domain architecture combines projection-domain and image-domain processing. In the projection domain, a specialized sinogram adapter captures global physical structures through convolution operations equivalent to global image-domain filtering. Experiments on the UDPET public dataset and clinical datasets with varying dose levels demonstrate that MiG-DM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in enhancing PET image quality and preserving physiological details.

TL;DR: Hybrid knowledge distillation framework creates lightweight CNN for edge devices in smart agriculture, achieving near-teacher accuracy with significantly reduced computational cost and model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained edge devices in smart agriculture, balancing computational efficiency and recognition accuracy.

Method: Proposes hybrid knowledge distillation framework with customized student model combining inverted residual blocks with dense connectivity, trained under ResNet18 teacher guidance using multi-objective strategy integrating hard-label supervision, feature-level distillation, response-level distillation, and self-distillation.

Result: Distilled student achieves 98.56% accuracy on rice seed classification (vs teacher's 98.65%) with only 0.68 GFLOPs and ~1.07M parameters - 2.7x less computation and >10x smaller than ResNet18. Outperforms DenseNet121 (6x fewer parameters) and ViT (80x fewer parameters) while maintaining comparable accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates robustness, efficiency, and strong deployment potential for hardware-limited smart agriculture systems, with consistent performance gains across multiple plant leaf disease datasets.

Abstract: Deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained edge devices remains a major challenge in smart agriculture due to the trade-off between computational efficiency and recognition accuracy. To address this challenge, this study proposes a hybrid knowledge distillation framework for developing a lightweight yet high-performance convolutional neural network. The proposed approach designs a customized student model that combines inverted residual blocks with dense connectivity and trains it under the guidance of a ResNet18 teacher network using a multi-objective strategy that integrates hard-label supervision, feature-level distillation, response-level distillation, and self-distillation. Experiments are conducted on a rice seed variety identification dataset containing nine varieties and further extended to four plant leaf disease datasets, including rice, potato, coffee, and corn, to evaluate generalization capability. On the rice seed variety classification task, the distilled student model achieves an accuracy of 98.56%, which is only 0.09% lower than the teacher model (98.65%), while requiring only 0.68 GFLOPs and approximately 1.07 million parameters. This corresponds to a reduction of about 2.7 times in computational cost and more than 10 times in model size compared with the ResNet18 teacher model. In addition, compared with representative pretrained models, the proposed student reduces the number of parameters by more than 6 times relative to DenseNet121 and by over 80 times compared with the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, while maintaining comparable or superior classification accuracy. Consistent performance gains across multiple plant leaf disease datasets further demonstrate the robustness, efficiency, and strong deployment potential of the proposed framework for hardware-limited smart agriculture systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adaptive RGB-LWIR fusion framework dynamically selects optimal detection models for different illumination conditions, significantly outperforming baseline YOLO models across all light levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RGB detection struggles in low-light, while thermal systems lack color/texture info. Need robust vision for emergency service robots operating in variable lighting conditions.

Method: Trained 33 YOLO models on 22k+ annotated images across three light levels. Fused RGB and LWIR streams at 11 blending ratios (100/0 to 0/100 in 10% increments). Dynamic model selection based on illumination conditions.

Result: Best models: 80/20 RGB-LWIR for full-light (92.8% confidence), 90/10 for dim-light (92.0%), 40/60 for no-light (71.0%). All significantly outperformed YOLOv5n and YOLOv11n baselines except no-light (exceeded but not statistically significant).

Conclusion: Adaptive RGB-LWIR fusion improves detection confidence and reliability across all illumination conditions, enhancing autonomous robotic vision performance for emergency services applications.

Abstract: Autonomous robotic platforms are playing a growing role across the emergency services sector, supporting missions such as search and rescue operations in disaster zones and reconnaissance. However, traditional red-green-blue (RGB) detection pipelines struggle in low-light environments, and thermal-based systems lack color and texture information. To overcome these limitations, we present an adaptive framework that fuses RGB and long-wave infrared (LWIR) video streams at multiple fusion ratios and dynamically selects the optimal detection model for each illumination condition. We trained 33 You Only Look Once (YOLO) models on over 22,000 annotated images spanning three light levels: no-light (<10 lux), dim-light (10-1000 lux), and full-light (>1000 lux). To integrate both modalities, fusion was performed by blending aligned RGB and LWIR frames at eleven ratios, from full RGB (100/0) to full LWIR (0/100) in 10% increments. Evaluation showed that the best full-light model (80/20 RGB-LWIR) and dim-light model (90/10 fusion) achieved 92.8% and 92.0% mean confidence; both significantly outperformed the YOLOv5 nano (YOLOv5n) and YOLOv11 nano (YOLOv11n) baselines. Under no-light conditions, the top 40/60 fusion reached 71.0%, exceeding baselines though not statistically significant. Adaptive RGB-LWIR fusion improved detection confidence and reliability across all illumination conditions, enhancing autonomous robotic vision performance.

TL;DR: Using lightweight discriminators as external guidance, researchers separate geometry from style in text-to-image diffusion models, improving geometric control by ~80% without specialized training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image diffusion models generate detailed textures but often fail to follow strict geometric constraints, especially when geometry conflicts with text-specified style, revealing a semantic gap between human perception and generative models.

Method: Propose Human Perception Embedding (HPE) teacher trained on THINGS triplet dataset to capture human sensitivity to object shape. Inject gradients from this teacher into latent diffusion process to separate geometry and style controllably. Evaluate across Stable Diffusion v1.5, SiT-XL/2 flow-matching model, and PixArt-Σ diffusion transformer.

Result: Flow models tend to drift back toward default trajectories without continuous guidance. Achieve zero-shot transfer of complex 3D shapes (like Eames chair) onto conflicting materials (pink metal). Guided generation improves semantic alignment by ~80% compared to unguided baselines.

Conclusion: Small teacher models can reliably guide large generative systems, enabling stronger geometric control and broadening the creative range of text-to-image synthesis without specialized training.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models generate highly detailed textures, yet they often rely on surface appearance and fail to follow strict geometric constraints, particularly when those constraints conflict with the style implied by the text prompt. This reflects a broader semantic gap between human perception and current generative models. We investigate whether geometric understanding can be introduced without specialized training by using lightweight, off-the-shelf discriminators as external guidance signals. We propose a Human Perception Embedding (HPE) teacher trained on the THINGS triplet dataset, which captures human sensitivity to object shape. By injecting gradients from this teacher into the latent diffusion process, we show that geometry and style can be separated in a controllable manner. We evaluate this approach across three architectures: Stable Diffusion v1.5 with a U-Net backbone, the flow-matching model SiT-XL/2, and the diffusion transformer PixArt-Σ. Our experiments reveal that flow models tend to drift back toward their default trajectories without continuous guidance, and we demonstrate zero-shot transfer of complex three-dimensional shapes, such as an Eames chair, onto conflicting materials such as pink metal. This guided generation improves semantic alignment by about 80 percent compared to unguided baselines. Overall, our results show that small teacher models can reliably guide large generative systems, enabling stronger geometric control and broadening the creative range of text-to-image synthesis.

TL;DR: Current AI models excel at structured medical questions but struggle with multimodal clinical reasoning, showing a 90% vs 60% performance gap between multiple-choice and open-ended tasks requiring image integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks based on medical exams fail to capture the integrated, multimodal reasoning needed for real-world patient care, necessitating more comprehensive evaluation of foundation models' true clinical capabilities.

Method: Developed the Bones and Joints (B&J) Benchmark with 1,245 questions from real orthopedic cases, assessing 7 clinical reasoning tasks across 11 VLMs and 6 LLMs compared to expert ground truth.

Result: Models achieved >90% accuracy on multiple-choice questions but dropped to ~60% on open-ended multimodal tasks; VLMs showed severe hallucinations ignoring visual evidence, and medical fine-tuning provided no consistent advantage.

Conclusion: Current AI models lack clinical competence for complex multimodal reasoning and should be limited to supportive text-based roles; fundamental breakthroughs in multimodal integration are needed for clinical advancement.

Abstract: Background: The rapid integration of foundation models into clinical practice and public health necessitates a rigorous evaluation of their true clinical reasoning capabilities beyond narrow examination success. Current benchmarks, typically based on medical licensing exams or curated vignettes, fail to capture the integrated, multimodal reasoning essential for real-world patient care. Methods: We developed the Bones and Joints (B&J) Benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation framework comprising 1,245 questions derived from real-world patient cases in orthopedics and sports medicine. This benchmark assesses models across 7 tasks that mirror the clinical reasoning pathway, including knowledge recall, text and image interpretation, diagnosis generation, treatment planning, and rationale provision. We evaluated eleven vision-language models (VLMs) and six large language models (LLMs), comparing their performance against expert-derived ground truth. Results: Our results demonstrate a pronounced performance gap between task types. While state-of-the-art models achieved high accuracy, exceeding 90%, on structured multiple-choice questions, their performance markedly declined on open-ended tasks requiring multimodal integration, with accuracy scarcely reaching 60%. VLMs demonstrated substantial limitations in interpreting medical images and frequently exhibited severe text-driven hallucinations, often ignoring contradictory visual evidence. Notably, models specifically fine-tuned for medical applications showed no consistent advantage over general-purpose counterparts. Conclusions: Current artificial intelligence models are not yet clinically competent for complex, multimodal reasoning. Their safe deployment should currently be limited to supportive, text-based roles. Future advancement in core clinical tasks awaits fundamental breakthroughs in multimodal integration and visual understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global shortage of trained sonographers creates barriers to fetal health monitoring. While VLMs show promise for ultrasound interpretation, no standardized benchmark exists to evaluate their performance in fetal ultrasound due to modality challenges and limited public datasets.

Method: Created Fetal-Gauge benchmark with over 42,000 images and 93,000 question-answer pairs covering five key tasks: anatomical plane identification, visual grounding of structures, fetal orientation assessment, clinical view conformity, and clinical diagnosis. Systematically evaluated state-of-the-art VLMs including general-purpose and medical-specific models.

Result: Best-performing model achieved only 55% accuracy, far below clinical requirements. Analysis revealed substantial performance gaps and critical limitations of current VLMs in fetal ultrasound interpretation.

Conclusion: Fetal-Gauge establishes a rigorous foundation for advancing multimodal deep learning in prenatal care. Results highlight urgent need for domain-adapted architectures and specialized training approaches to address global healthcare accessibility challenges.

Abstract: The growing demand for prenatal ultrasound imaging has intensified a global shortage of trained sonographers, creating barriers to essential fetal health monitoring. Deep learning has the potential to enhance sonographers' efficiency and support the training of new practitioners. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are particularly promising for ultrasound interpretation, as they can jointly process images and text to perform multiple clinical tasks within a single framework. However, despite the expansion of VLMs, no standardized benchmark exists to evaluate their performance in fetal ultrasound imaging. This gap is primarily due to the modality's challenging nature, operator dependency, and the limited public availability of datasets. To address this gap, we present Fetal-Gauge, the first and largest visual question answering benchmark specifically designed to evaluate VLMs across various fetal ultrasound tasks. Our benchmark comprises over 42,000 images and 93,000 question-answer pairs, spanning anatomical plane identification, visual grounding of anatomical structures, fetal orientation assessment, clinical view conformity, and clinical diagnosis. We systematically evaluate several state-of-the-art VLMs, including general-purpose and medical-specific models, and reveal a substantial performance gap: the best-performing model achieves only 55\% accuracy, far below clinical requirements. Our analysis identifies critical limitations of current VLMs in fetal ultrasound interpretation, highlighting the urgent need for domain-adapted architectures and specialized training approaches. Fetal-Gauge establishes a rigorous foundation for advancing multimodal deep learning in prenatal care and provides a pathway toward addressing global healthcare accessibility challenges. Our benchmark will be publicly available once the paper gets accepted.

Conclusion: Demonstrates practical real-time driver monitoring on low-cost edge platforms, and discusses how reliable human-state perception can serve as upstream input for human-centered vehicle intelligence and emerging agentic vehicle concepts.

Abstract: In-cabin Driver Monitoring Systems (DMS) must recognize distraction- and drowsiness-related behaviors with low latency under strict constraints on compute, power, and cost. We present a single-camera in-cabin driver behavior recognition system designed for deployment on two low-cost edge platforms: Raspberry Pi 5 (CPU-only) and Google Coral Edge TPU. The proposed pipeline combines (i) a compact per-frame vision model, (ii) a confounder-aware label design to reduce visually similar false positives, and (iii) a temporal decision head that triggers alerts only when predictions are both confident and sustained. The system covers 17 behavior classes, including multiple phone-use modes, eating/drinking, smoking, reaching behind, gaze/attention shifts, passenger interaction, grooming, control-panel interaction, yawning, and eyes-closed sleep. Training and evaluation use licensed datasets spanning diverse drivers, vehicles, and lighting conditions (details in Section 6), and we further validate runtime behavior in real in-vehicle tests. The optimized deployments achieve about 16 FPS on Raspberry Pi 5 with INT8 inference (per-frame latency under 60 ms) and about 25 FPS on Coral Edge TPU, enabling real-time monitoring and stable alert generation on inexpensive hardware. Finally, we discuss how reliable in-cabin human-state perception can serve as an upstream input for human-centered vehicle intelligence, including emerging agentic vehicle concepts.

Motivation: Need for deepfake and image-forensics detectors that are robust, well-calibrated, and transparent under realistic deployment conditions with various counter-forensics attacks.

Method: Two-stream architecture: semantic content encoding via pretrained backbone + forensic residual extraction, fused via residual adapter. Red-team training applies worst-of-K counter-forensics attacks per batch. Test-time defense injects low-cost jitters. Weakly supervised heatmaps guided by face-box masks.

Result: Near-perfect ranking across attacks, low calibration error, minimal abstention risk, controlled degradation under regrain, and strong performance on benchmarks including surveillance-style splits.

Conclusion: Establishes modular, data-efficient, practically deployable baseline for attack-aware detection with calibrated probabilities and actionable heatmaps.

Abstract: This work presents an attack-aware deepfake and image-forensics detector designed for robustness, well-calibrated probabilities, and transparent evidence under realistic deployment conditions. The method combines red-team training with randomized test-time defense in a two-stream architecture, where one stream encodes semantic content using a pretrained backbone and the other extracts forensic residuals, fused via a lightweight residual adapter for classification, while a shallow Feature Pyramid Network style head produces tamper heatmaps under weak supervision. Red-team training applies worst-of-K counter-forensics per batch, including JPEG realign and recompress, resampling warps, denoise-to-regrain operations, seam smoothing, small color and gamma shifts, and social-app transcodes, while test-time defense injects low-cost jitters such as resize and crop phase changes, mild gamma variation, and JPEG phase shifts with aggregated predictions. Heatmaps are guided to concentrate within face regions using face-box masks without strict pixel-level annotations. Evaluation on existing benchmarks, including standard deepfake datasets and a surveillance-style split with low light and heavy compression, reports clean and attacked performance, AUC, worst-case accuracy, reliability, abstention quality, and weak-localization scores. Results demonstrate near-perfect ranking across attacks, low calibration error, minimal abstention risk, and controlled degradation under regrain, establishing a modular, data-efficient, and practically deployable baseline for attack-aware detection with calibrated probabilities and actionable heatmaps.

Abstract: Accurate food nutrition estimation from single images is challenging due to the loss of 3D information. While depth-based methods provide reliable geometry, they remain inaccessible on most smartphones because of depth-sensor requirements. To overcome this challenge, we propose PortionNet, a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that learns geometric features from point clouds during training while requiring only RGB images at inference. Our approach employs a dual-mode training strategy where a lightweight adapter network mimics point cloud representations, enabling pseudo-3D reasoning without any specialized hardware requirements. PortionNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on MetaFood3D, outperforming all previous methods in both volume and energy estimation. Cross-dataset evaluation on SimpleFood45 further demonstrates strong generalization in energy estimation.

TL;DR: MoFu is a unified framework for multi-subject video generation that addresses scale inconsistency and permutation sensitivity through Scale-Aware Modulation and Fourier Fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-subject video generation methods suffer from scale inconsistency (unnatural subject sizes) and permutation sensitivity (subject distortion based on reference input order), which degrade visual quality and subject fidelity.

Method: Proposes MoFu with: 1) Scale-Aware Modulation (SMO) - LLM-guided module that extracts scale cues from prompts to modulate features; 2) Fourier Fusion - processes reference features via FFT for unified representation; 3) Scale-Permutation Stability Loss for joint optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments show MoFu significantly outperforms existing methods in preserving natural scale, subject fidelity, and overall visual quality. A dedicated benchmark was established to evaluate scale and permutation challenges.

Conclusion: MoFu effectively addresses key challenges in multi-subject video generation through innovative scale-aware modulation and permutation-invariant fusion techniques, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Multi-subject video generation aims to synthesize videos from textual prompts and multiple reference images, ensuring that each subject preserves natural scale and visual fidelity. However, current methods face two challenges: scale inconsistency, where variations in subject size lead to unnatural generation, and permutation sensitivity, where the order of reference inputs causes subject distortion. In this paper, we propose MoFu, a unified framework that tackles both challenges. For scale inconsistency, we introduce Scale-Aware Modulation (SMO), an LLM-guided module that extracts implicit scale cues from the prompt and modulates features to ensure consistent subject sizes. To address permutation sensitivity, we present a simple yet effective Fourier Fusion strategy that processes the frequency information of reference features via the Fast Fourier Transform to produce a unified representation. Besides, we design a Scale-Permutation Stability Loss to jointly encourage scale-consistent and permutation-invariant generation. To further evaluate these challenges, we establish a dedicated benchmark with controlled variations in subject scale and reference permutation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoFu significantly outperforms existing methods in preserving natural scale, subject fidelity, and overall visual quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoZoomer: An agentic MLLM framework that dynamically controls visual focus during reasoning by starting with low-frame-rate overviews and invoking temporal zoom tools for high-frame-rate clips at autonomously chosen moments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs are limited in long video understanding due to limited context windows, relying on uniform frame sampling or static pre-selection which may overlook critical evidence and cannot correct initial selection errors during reasoning.

Method: Agentic framework enabling MLLMs to dynamically control visual focus during reasoning. Starts with coarse low-frame-rate overview, then invokes temporal zoom tool to obtain high-frame-rate clips at autonomously chosen moments, progressively gathering fine-grained evidence in multi-turn interactive manner. Uses two-stage training: cold-start supervised fine-tuning on curated dataset of distilled exemplar and reflection trajectories, followed by reinforcement learning to refine agentic policy.

Result: 7B model delivers diverse and complex reasoning patterns, achieving strong performance across broad set of long video understanding and reasoning benchmarks. Consistently surpasses existing open-source models and rivals proprietary systems on challenging tasks, while achieving superior efficiency under reduced frame budgets.

Conclusion: VideoZoomer enables MLLMs to overcome limitations in long video understanding through dynamic visual focus control, demonstrating emergent capabilities that outperform existing approaches while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in vision-language tasks yet remain limited in long video understanding due to the limited context window. Consequently, prevailing approaches tend to rely on uniform frame sampling or static pre-selection, which might overlook critical evidence and unable to correct its initial selection error during its reasoning process. To overcome these limitations, we propose VideoZoomer, a novel agentic framework that enables MLLMs to dynamically control their visual focus during reasoning. Starting from a coarse low-frame-rate overview, VideoZoomer invokes a temporal zoom tool to obtain high-frame-rate clips at autonomously chosen moments, thereby progressively gathering fine-grained evidence in a multi-turn interactive manner. Accordingly, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: a cold-start supervised fine-tuning phase on a curated dataset of distilled exemplar and reflection trajectories, followed by reinforcement learning to further refine the agentic policy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 7B model delivers diverse and complex reasoning patterns, yielding strong performance across a broad set of long video understanding and reasoning benchmarks. These emergent capabilities allow it to consistently surpass existing open-source models and even rival proprietary systems on challenging tasks, while achieving superior efficiency under reduced frame budgets.

*Zhibin Qin,Zhenxiong Tan,Zeqing Wang,Songhua Liu,Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpotEdit is a training-free diffusion editing framework that selectively updates only modified regions instead of uniformly processing all tokens, reducing redundant computation while preserving unchanged areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion transformer methods uniformly process and denoise all tokens at every timestep even when only small regions need editing, causing redundant computation and potential degradation of unchanged areas. The paper questions whether regenerating every region during editing is truly necessary.

Method: SpotEdit has two components: SpotSelector identifies stable regions via perceptual similarity and skips their computation by reusing conditional image features; SpotFusion adaptively blends these features with edited tokens through a dynamic fusion mechanism to preserve contextual coherence and editing quality.

Result: SpotEdit achieves efficient and precise image editing by reducing unnecessary computation while maintaining high fidelity in unmodified areas.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free framework demonstrates that selective region updating is more efficient than uniform processing for diffusion-based image editing, offering a practical solution to computational redundancy in editing tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer models have significantly advanced image editing by encoding conditional images and integrating them into transformer layers. However, most edits involve modifying only small regions, while current methods uniformly process and denoise all tokens at every timestep, causing redundant computation and potentially degrading unchanged areas. This raises a fundamental question: Is it truly necessary to regenerate every region during editing? To address this, we propose SpotEdit, a training-free diffusion editing framework that selectively updates only the modified regions. SpotEdit comprises two key components: SpotSelector identifies stable regions via perceptual similarity and skips their computation by reusing conditional image features; SpotFusion adaptively blends these features with edited tokens through a dynamic fusion mechanism, preserving contextual coherence and editing quality. By reducing unnecessary computation and maintaining high fidelity in unmodified areas, SpotEdit achieves efficient and precise image editing.

### [32] [DeMoGen: Towards Decompositional Human Motion Generation with Energy-Based Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22324)
*Jianrong Zhang,Hehe Fan,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeMoGen is a compositional training paradigm using energy-based diffusion models to decompose holistic human motions into semantically meaningful sub-components without ground-truth data, enabling discovery of reusable motion primitives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches focus on forward modeling (text-to-motion or composing motions), but lack the inverse perspective of decomposing holistic motions into meaningful sub-components. Human motions are compositional, so understanding how to break them down into simpler primitives is valuable for motion analysis and generation.

Method: Proposes DeMoGen, a compositional training paradigm using an energy-based diffusion model that captures the composed distribution of multiple motion concepts. Introduces three training variants: 1) DeMoGen-Exp (explicit training on decomposed text prompts), 2) DeMoGen-OSS (orthogonal self-supervised decomposition), and 3) DeMoGen-SC (semantic consistency between original and decomposed text embeddings). Also constructs a text-decomposed dataset to support compositional training.

Result: The approach successfully disentangles reusable motion primitives from complex motion sequences. The decomposed motion concepts can be flexibly recombined to generate diverse and novel motions that generalize beyond the training distribution.

Conclusion: DeMoGen provides an effective framework for decompositional learning of human motions, enabling both analysis (decomposition) and synthesis (recombination) of motion primitives, with applications in text-to-motion generation and motion composition.

Abstract: Human motions are compositional: complex behaviors can be described as combinations of simpler primitives. However, existing approaches primarily focus on forward modeling, e.g., learning holistic mappings from text to motion or composing a complex motion from a set of motion concepts. In this paper, we consider the inverse perspective: decomposing a holistic motion into semantically meaningful sub-components. We propose DeMoGen, a compositional training paradigm for decompositional learning that employs an energy-based diffusion model. This energy formulation directly captures the composed distribution of multiple motion concepts, enabling the model to discover them without relying on ground-truth motions for individual concepts. Within this paradigm, we introduce three training variants to encourage a decompositional understanding of motion: 1. DeMoGen-Exp explicitly trains on decomposed text prompts; 2. DeMoGen-OSS performs orthogonal self-supervised decomposition; 3. DeMoGen-SC enforces semantic consistency between original and decomposed text embeddings. These variants enable our approach to disentangle reusable motion primitives from complex motion sequences. We also demonstrate that the decomposed motion concepts can be flexibly recombined to generate diverse and novel motions, generalizing beyond the training distribution. Additionally, we construct a text-decomposed dataset to support compositional training, serving as an extended resource to facilitate text-to-motion generation and motion composition.

*Mariya Miteva,Maria Nisheva-Pavlova*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-view VAE framework integrates T1Gd and FLAIR MRI radiomic features for non-invasive MGMT promoter methylation classification in glioblastoma, addressing limitations of conventional unimodal/early-fusion approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-invasive inference of MGMT promoter methylation status in glioblastoma is clinically important but conventional radiomics methods suffer from high feature redundancy and incomplete modeling of modality-specific information from multi-modal MRI.

Method: Multi-view variational autoencoder framework with independent probabilistic encoders for each modality (T1Gd and FLAIR MRI), performing fusion in compact latent space to preserve modality-specific structure while enabling effective multimodal integration.

Result: The approach generates latent embeddings that are subsequently used for MGMT promoter methylation classification, though specific classification performance metrics are not provided in the abstract.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-view VAE framework offers a promising approach for integrating complementary radiomic features from multi-modal MRI to improve non-invasive molecular characterization of glioblastoma tumors.

Abstract: Non-invasive inference of molecular tumor characteristics from medical imaging is a central goal of radiogenomics, particularly in glioblastoma (GBM), where O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation carries important prognostic and therapeutic significance. Although radiomics-based machine learning methods have shown promise for this task, conventional unimodal and early-fusion approaches are often limited by high feature redundancy and an incomplete modeling of modality-specific information. In this work, we introduce a multi-view latent representation learning framework based on variational autoencoders (VAE) to integrate complementary radiomic features derived from post-contrast T1-weighted (T1Gd) and Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). By encoding each modality through an independent probabilistic encoder and performing fusion in a compact latent space, the proposed approach preserves modality-specific structure while enabling effective multimodal integration. The resulting latent embeddings are subsequently used for MGMT promoter methylation classification.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for HER2 scoring lack pixel-level localization capabilities and struggle with joint analysis of H&E and IHC stained images, which is crucial for accurate HER2 protein expression assessment in cancer treatment planning

Method: Single end-to-end vision transformer pipeline with patch-wise H&E processing for tumor localization, novel mapping function to correlate IHC regions with H&E malignant areas, and clinically inspired HER2 scoring mechanism for automatic pixel-level annotation

Result: Achieved 0.94 classification accuracy and 0.933 specificity for 4-way HER2 status prediction, with good tumor localization accuracy; performance comparable to human pathologists on WSI patches

Conclusion: Vision transformer-based models can effectively jointly evaluate H&E and IHC images for HER2 scoring with pixel-level precision, offering a clinically useful automated solution

Abstract: The popular use of histopathology images, such as hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), has proven to be useful in detecting tumors. However, moving such cancer cases forward for treatment requires accurate on the amount of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein expression. Predicting both the lower and higher levels of HER2 can be challenging. Moreover, jointly analyzing H&E and immunohistochemistry (IHC) stained images for HER2 scoring is difficult. Although several deep learning methods have been investigated to address the challenge of HER2 scoring, they suffer from providing a pixel-level localization of HER2 status. In this study, we propose a single end-to-end pipeline using a system of vision transformers with HER2 status scoring on whole slide images of WSIs. The method includes patch-wise processing of H&E WSIs for tumor localization. A novel mapping function is proposed to correspondingly identify correlated IHC WSIs regions with malignant regions on H&E. A clinically inspired HER2 scoring mechanism is embedded in the pipeline and allows for automatic pixel-level annotation of 4-way HER2 scoring (0, 1+, 2+, and 3+). Also, the proposed method accurately returns HER2-negative and HER2-positive. Privately curated datasets were collaboratively extracted from 13 different cases of WSIs of H&E and IHC. A thorough experiment is conducted on the proposed method. Results obtained showed a good classification accuracy during tumor localization. Also, a classification accuracy of 0.94 and a specificity of 0.933 were returned for the prediction of HER2 status, scoring in the 4-way methods. The applicability of the proposed pipeline was investigated using WSIs patches as comparable to human pathologists. Findings from the study showed the usability of jointly evaluated H&E and IHC images on end-to-end ViTs-based models for HER2 scoring

*Alaa Alahmadi,Mohamed Hasan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Human-inspired pseudo-coloring improves ECG analysis: boosts few-shot learning and explainability for detecting drug-induced long QT syndrome with minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for ECG analysis require large datasets and lack interpretability, limiting clinical reliability and alignment with human reasoning. There's a need for more data-efficient and explainable approaches.

Method: Used perception-informed pseudo-coloring technique that encodes clinically salient temporal features (like QT-interval duration) into structured color representations. Applied prototypical networks with ResNet-18 architecture for one-shot and few-shot learning on ECG images from single cycles and full 10-second rhythms.

Result: Models learned discriminative and interpretable features from as few as 1-5 training examples. Pseudo-coloring guided attention toward clinically meaningful ECG features while suppressing irrelevant components. Aggregating multiple cardiac cycles further improved performance, mimicking human perceptual averaging.

Conclusion: Human-like perceptual encoding can bridge data efficiency, explainability, and causal reasoning in medical machine intelligence, demonstrating that biologically-inspired approaches can enhance both performance and clinical interpretability.

Abstract: Machine vision models, particularly deep neural networks, are increasingly applied to physiological signal interpretation, including electrocardiography (ECG), yet they typically require large training datasets and offer limited insight into the causal features underlying their predictions. This lack of data efficiency and interpretability constrains their clinical reliability and alignment with human reasoning. Here, we show that a perception-informed pseudo-colouring technique, previously demonstrated to enhance human ECG interpretation, can improve both explainability and few-shot learning in deep neural networks analysing complex physiological data.
  We focus on acquired, drug-induced long QT syndrome (LQTS) as a challenging case study characterised by heterogeneous signal morphology, variable heart rate, and scarce positive cases associated with life-threatening arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. This setting provides a stringent test of model generalisation under extreme data scarcity. By encoding clinically salient temporal features, such as QT-interval duration, into structured colour representations, models learn discriminative and interpretable features from as few as one or five training examples. Using prototypical networks and a ResNet-18 architecture, we evaluate one-shot and few-shot learning on ECG images derived from single cardiac cycles and full 10-second rhythms. Explainability analyses show that pseudo-colouring guides attention toward clinically meaningful ECG features while suppressing irrelevant signal components. Aggregating multiple cardiac cycles further improves performance, mirroring human perceptual averaging across heartbeats. Together, these findings demonstrate that human-like perceptual encoding can bridge data efficiency, explainability, and causal reasoning in medical machine intelligence.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite MLLMs' progress in 2D vision-language tasks, their application to complex 3D scene manipulation remains underexplored, with challenges in visual grounding, 3D scene understanding, and iterative error-prone updates.

Method: Three key innovations: 1) MCP-based API to shift from brittle code manipulation to robust function-level updates, 2) specialized visual tools for scene analysis and spatial information gathering, 3) collaborative multi-agent framework with planning, execution, and verification roles.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on 25 complex object arrangement tasks, significantly outperforming existing baselines.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges the gap between MLLMs and complex 3D scene manipulation through API design, perceptual feedback, and multi-agent collaboration.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in 2D vision-language tasks, their application to complex 3D scene manipulation remains underexplored. In this paper, we bridge this critical gap by tackling three key challenges in 3D object arrangement task using MLLMs. First, to address the weak visual grounding of MLLMs, which struggle to link programmatic edits with precise 3D outcomes, we introduce an MCP-based API. This shifts the interaction from brittle raw code manipulation to more robust, function-level updates. Second, we augment the MLLM's 3D scene understanding with a suite of specialized visual tools to analyze scene state, gather spatial information, and validate action outcomes. This perceptual feedback loop is critical for closing the gap between language-based updates and precise 3D-aware manipulation. Third, to manage the iterative, error-prone updates, we propose a collaborative multi-agent framework with designated roles for planning, execution, and verification. This decomposition allows the system to robustly handle multi-step instructions and recover from intermediate errors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a diverse set of 25 complex object arrangement tasks, where it significantly outperforms existing baselines. Website: vulcan-3d.github.io

TL;DR: Self-E is a novel text-to-image model trained from scratch that supports any-step inference through self-evaluation, bridging flow matching and distillation approaches without needing a pretrained teacher.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified text-to-image model that works well at any inference step count (from few-step to many-step) without requiring pretrained teachers or being limited by traditional diffusion/flow models' local supervision constraints.

Method: Combines flow matching training with a novel self-evaluation mechanism where the model evaluates its own generated samples using current score estimates, acting as a dynamic self-teacher that bridges local learning and global matching.

Result: Excels in few-step generation while being competitive with state-of-the-art Flow Matching models at 50 steps; performance improves monotonically with inference steps; enables both ultra-fast few-step and high-quality long-trajectory sampling in a single model.

Conclusion: Self-E is the first from-scratch, any-step text-to-image model offering a unified framework for efficient and scalable generation, bridging the gap between flow matching and distillation paradigms.

Abstract: We introduce the Self-Evaluating Model (Self-E), a novel, from-scratch training approach for text-to-image generation that supports any-step inference. Self-E learns from data similarly to a Flow Matching model, while simultaneously employing a novel self-evaluation mechanism: it evaluates its own generated samples using its current score estimates, effectively serving as a dynamic self-teacher. Unlike traditional diffusion or flow models, it does not rely solely on local supervision, which typically necessitates many inference steps. Unlike distillation-based approaches, it does not require a pretrained teacher. This combination of instantaneous local learning and self-driven global matching bridges the gap between the two paradigms, enabling the training of a high-quality text-to-image model from scratch that excels even at very low step counts. Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image benchmarks show that Self-E not only excels in few-step generation, but is also competitive with state-of-the-art Flow Matching models at 50 steps. We further find that its performance improves monotonically as inference steps increase, enabling both ultra-fast few-step generation and high-quality long-trajectory sampling within a single unified model. To our knowledge, Self-E is the first from-scratch, any-step text-to-image model, offering a unified framework for efficient and scalable generation.

TL;DR: DeFloMat replaces slow diffusion-based object detection with fast Conditional Flow Matching, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy in just 3 steps for clinical Crohn's Disease detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based detectors like DiffusionDet have high accuracy but require many sampling steps (T >> 60), making them impractical for time-sensitive clinical applications such as Crohn's Disease detection in MRI.

Method: Replaces stochastic diffusion process with deterministic flow field from Conditional Optimal Transport theory (Rectified Flow approximation), enabling fast inference via simple ODE solver.

Result: Achieves 43.32% AP10:50 in only 3 inference steps (1.4× improvement over DiffusionDet's 31.03% at 4 steps), with superior recall and stability in few-step regime on MRE clinical dataset.

Conclusion: Resolves trade-off between generative accuracy and clinical efficiency, setting new standard for stable and rapid object localization in time-sensitive medical applications.

Abstract: We propose DeFloMat (Detection with Flow Matching), a novel generative object detection framework that addresses the critical latency bottleneck of diffusion-based detectors, such as DiffusionDet, by integrating Conditional Flow Matching (CFM). Diffusion models achieve high accuracy by formulating detection as a multi-step stochastic denoising process, but their reliance on numerous sampling steps ($T \gg 60$) makes them impractical for time-sensitive clinical applications like Crohn's Disease detection in Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE). DeFloMat replaces this slow stochastic path with a highly direct, deterministic flow field derived from Conditional Optimal Transport (OT) theory, specifically approximating the Rectified Flow. This shift enables fast inference via a simple Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver. We demonstrate the superiority of DeFloMat on a challenging MRE clinical dataset. Crucially, DeFloMat achieves state-of-the-art accuracy ($43.32\% \text{ } AP_{10:50}$) in only $3$ inference steps, which represents a $1.4\times$ performance improvement over DiffusionDet's maximum converged performance ($31.03\% \text{ } AP_{10:50}$ at $4$ steps). Furthermore, our deterministic flow significantly enhances localization characteristics, yielding superior Recall and stability in the few-step regime. DeFloMat resolves the trade-off between generative accuracy and clinical efficiency, setting a new standard for stable and rapid object localization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label-free 3D brightfield microscopy is fast and noninvasive but lacks robust volumetric segmentation capabilities without fluorescence or extensive post-processing.

Method: Combines Native Sparse Attention (local/coarse/global context), depth-width residual HyperConnections, soft Mixture-of-Experts, and anisotropic patch embedding respecting confocal geometry.

Result: Produces morphology-accurate segmentations of nuclei, mitochondria, and organelles from brightfield alone, outperforming CNN and Transformer baselines across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Bright-4B enables large-scale, label-free 3D cell mapping with all code, weights, and models released for community use.

Abstract: Label-free 3D brightfield microscopy offers a fast and noninvasive way to visualize cellular morphology, yet robust volumetric segmentation still typically depends on fluorescence or heavy post-processing. We address this gap by introducing Bright-4B, a 4 billion parameter foundation model that learns on the unit hypersphere to segment subcellular structures directly from 3D brightfield volumes. Bright-4B combines a hardware-aligned Native Sparse Attention mechanism (capturing local, coarse, and selected global context), depth-width residual HyperConnections that stabilize representation flow, and a soft Mixture-of-Experts for adaptive capacity. A plug-and-play anisotropic patch embed further respects confocal point-spread and axial thinning, enabling geometry-faithful 3D tokenization. The resulting model produces morphology-accurate segmentations of nuclei, mitochondria, and other organelles from brightfield stacks alone--without fluorescence, auxiliary channels, or handcrafted post-processing. Across multiple confocal datasets, Bright-4B preserves fine structural detail across depth and cell types, outperforming contemporary CNN and Transformer baselines. All code, pretrained weights, and models for downstream finetuning will be released to advance large-scale, label-free 3D cell mapping.

TL;DR: FluenceFormer is a transformer-based framework for radiotherapy fluence map prediction that uses a two-stage design with physics-informed loss to address long-range dependencies and physical constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current convolutional methods struggle with long-range dependencies in fluence map prediction, leading to structurally inconsistent or physically unrealizable radiotherapy plans.

Method: A backbone-agnostic transformer framework with two stages: Stage 1 predicts global dose prior from anatomical inputs; Stage 2 conditions this prior on explicit beam geometry to regress physically calibrated fluence maps using Fluence-Aware Regression (FAR) loss.

Result: FluenceFormer with Swin UNETR achieves best performance, reducing Energy Error to 4.5% and showing statistically significant gains in structural fidelity (p < 0.05) compared to CNN and single-stage methods.

Conclusion: The transformer-based FluenceFormer framework effectively addresses long-range dependency issues in fluence map prediction and outperforms existing methods while maintaining physical plausibility.

Abstract: Fluence map prediction is central to automated radiotherapy planning but remains an ill-posed inverse problem due to the complex relationship between volumetric anatomy and beam-intensity modulation. Convolutional methods in prior work often struggle to capture long-range dependencies, which can lead to structurally inconsistent or physically unrealizable plans. We introduce \textbf{FluenceFormer}, a backbone-agnostic transformer framework for direct, geometry-aware fluence regression. The model uses a unified two-stage design: Stage~1 predicts a global dose prior from anatomical inputs, and Stage~2 conditions this prior on explicit beam geometry to regress physically calibrated fluence maps. Central to the approach is the \textbf{Fluence-Aware Regression (FAR)} loss, a physics-informed objective that integrates voxel-level fidelity, gradient smoothness, structural consistency, and beam-wise energy conservation. We evaluate the generality of the framework across multiple transformer backbones, including Swin UNETR, UNETR, nnFormer, and MedFormer, using a prostate IMRT dataset.

*Jingyuan Yang,Weibin Luo,Hui Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EmoCtrl enables controllable emotional image generation that maintains content fidelity while expressing target emotions, addressing limitations of existing models that either lack emotional awareness or distort content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Images convey meaning through both visual content and emotional tone, but existing text-to-image models ensure content consistency without emotional awareness, while emotion-driven models generate affective results at the cost of content distortion.

Method: Propose EmoCtrl with textual and visual emotion enhancement modules that enrich affective expression via descriptive semantics and perceptual cues, supported by a dataset annotated with content, emotion, and affective prompts.

Result: EmoCtrl achieves faithful content and expressive emotion control, outperforming existing methods across multiple aspects, with user studies confirming strong alignment with human preference and good generalization to creative applications.

Conclusion: EmoCtrl successfully bridges the gap between content-faithful and emotion-expressive image generation, demonstrating robust and adaptable emotion tokens that enable controllable emotional image content generation.

Abstract: An image conveys meaning through both its visual content and emotional tone, jointly shaping human perception. We introduce Controllable Emotional Image Content Generation (C-EICG), which aims to generate images that remain faithful to a given content description while expressing a target emotion. Existing text-to-image models ensure content consistency but lack emotional awareness, whereas emotion-driven models generate affective results at the cost of content distortion. To address this gap, we propose EmoCtrl, supported by a dataset annotated with content, emotion, and affective prompts, bridging abstract emotions to visual cues. EmoCtrl incorporates textual and visual emotion enhancement modules that enrich affective expression via descriptive semantics and perceptual cues. The learned emotion tokens exhibit complementary effects, as demonstrated through ablations and visualizations. Quantatitive and qualatitive experiments demonstrate that EmoCtrl achieves faithful content and expressive emotion control, outperforming existing methods across multiple aspects. User studies confirm EmoCtrl's strong alignment with human preference. Moreover, EmoCtrl generalizes well to creative applications, further demonstrating the robustness and adaptability of the learned emotion tokens.

*Sukhyun Jeong,Yong-Hoon Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PGR²M introduces a hybrid motion representation combining interpretable pose codes with residual codes to improve text-based 3D motion generation and editing by capturing both global structure and fine-grained temporal details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pose-code-based frameworks like CoMo struggle to capture subtle temporal dynamics and high-frequency details in motion generation and editing, degrading reconstruction fidelity and local controllability.

Method: Hybrid representation using pose-guided residual refinement: pose codes for global structure + residual codes via RVQ for fine details. Uses pose-guided RVQ tokenizer, base Transformer for pose codes, refine Transformer for residual codes with residual dropout to prevent over-reliance on residuals.

Result: Improves Fréchet inception distance and reconstruction metrics on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets compared to CoMo and recent diffusion/tokenization baselines. User studies confirm intuitive, structure-preserving motion edits.

Conclusion: PGR²M successfully addresses limitations of pose-code-only frameworks by augmenting interpretable pose codes with residual codes, enabling better motion generation and editing while maintaining semantic alignment and editability.

Abstract: Text-based 3D motion generation aims to automatically synthesize diverse motions from natural-language descriptions to extend user creativity, whereas motion editing modifies an existing motion sequence in response to text while preserving its overall structure. Pose-code-based frameworks such as CoMo map quantifiable pose attributes into discrete pose codes that support interpretable motion control, but their frame-wise representation struggles to capture subtle temporal dynamics and high-frequency details, often degrading reconstruction fidelity and local controllability. To address this limitation, we introduce pose-guided residual refinement for motion (PGR$^2$M), a hybrid representation that augments interpretable pose codes with residual codes learned via residual vector quantization (RVQ). A pose-guided RVQ tokenizer decomposes motion into pose latents that encode coarse global structure and residual latents that model fine-grained temporal variations. Residual dropout further discourages over-reliance on residuals, preserving the semantic alignment and editability of the pose codes. On top of this tokenizer, a base Transformer autoregressively predicts pose codes from text, and a refine Transformer predicts residual codes conditioned on text, pose codes, and quantization stage. Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML show that PGR$^2$M improves Fréchet inception distance and reconstruction metrics for both generation and editing compared with CoMo and recent diffusion- and tokenization-based baselines, while user studies confirm that it enables intuitive, structure-preserving motion edits.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SuperiorGAT uses graph attention networks to reconstruct missing elevation data in sparse LiDAR point clouds, achieving better accuracy than PointNet and deeper GAT models without increasing network depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR perception in autonomous systems faces limitations from fixed vertical beam resolution and beam dropout due to environmental occlusions, creating sparse point clouds with missing elevation information that needs reconstruction.

Method: SuperiorGAT models LiDAR scans as beam-aware graphs and uses graph attention networks with gated residual fusion and feed-forward refinement to reconstruct missing elevation data without increasing network depth. Evaluation uses simulated structured beam dropout (removing every fourth vertical beam).

Result: Extensive experiments on KITTI environments show SuperiorGAT consistently achieves lower reconstruction error and better geometric consistency compared to PointNet-based models and deeper GAT baselines. X-Z projections confirm structural integrity preservation with minimal vertical distortion.

Conclusion: Architectural refinement through SuperiorGAT offers a computationally efficient method for improving LiDAR resolution without requiring additional sensor hardware, addressing beam dropout issues in autonomous perception systems.

Abstract: LiDAR-based perception in autonomous systems is constrained by fixed vertical beam resolution and further compromised by beam dropout resulting from environmental occlusions. This paper introduces SuperiorGAT, a graph attention-based framework designed to reconstruct missing elevation information in sparse LiDAR point clouds. By modeling LiDAR scans as beam-aware graphs and incorporating gated residual fusion with feed-forward refinement, SuperiorGAT enables accurate reconstruction without increasing network depth. To evaluate performance, structured beam dropout is simulated by removing every fourth vertical scanning beam. Extensive experiments across diverse KITTI environments, including Person, Road, Campus, and City sequences, demonstrate that SuperiorGAT consistently achieves lower reconstruction error and improved geometric consistency compared to PointNet-based models and deeper GAT baselines. Qualitative X-Z projections further confirm the model's ability to preserve structural integrity with minimal vertical distortion. These results suggest that architectural refinement offers a computationally efficient method for improving LiDAR resolution without requiring additional sensor hardware.

Conclusion: MUSON addresses key limitations in social navigation datasets by providing structured reasoning annotations and balanced action distributions, enabling better learning of safety-critical behaviors and serving as a valuable benchmark for the field.

Abstract: Socially compliant navigation requires structured reasoning over dynamic pedestrians and physical constraints to ensure safe and interpretable decisions. However, existing social navigation datasets often lack explicit reasoning supervision and exhibit highly long-tailed action distributions, limiting models' ability to learn safety-critical behaviors. To address these issues, we introduce MUSON, a multimodal dataset for short-horizon social navigation collected across diverse indoor and outdoor campus scenes. MUSON adopts a structured five-step Chain-of-Thought annotation consisting of perception, prediction, reasoning, action, and explanation, with explicit modeling of static physical constraints and a rationally balanced discrete action space. Compared to SNEI, MUSON provides consistent reasoning, action, and explanation. Benchmarking multiple state-of-the-art Small Vision Language Models on MUSON shows that Qwen2.5-VL-3B achieves the highest decision accuracy of 0.8625, demonstrating that MUSON serves as an effective and reusable benchmark for socially compliant navigation.

*Zibin Liu,Banglei Guana,Yang Shanga,Zhenbao Yu,Yifei Bian,Qifeng Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A line-based event camera calibration method that uses geometric lines from man-made objects instead of traditional calibration patterns, enabling faster calibration without manual setup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current event camera calibration methods are time-consuming, require manually placed calibration objects, and cannot meet the needs of rapidly changing scenarios. There's a need for more efficient calibration approaches that leverage natural features in the environment.

Method: The framework detects lines directly from event streams and uses an event-line calibration model to generate initial camera parameter guesses, suitable for both planar and non-planar lines. A non-linear optimization then refines the camera parameters.

Result: Both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of the method, with validation performed on monocular and stereo event cameras.

Conclusion: The proposed line-based calibration framework provides an efficient and accurate alternative to traditional event camera calibration methods by exploiting geometric lines commonly found in man-made environments, eliminating the need for manual calibration objects.

Abstract: Camera calibration is an essential prerequisite for event-based vision applications. Current event camera calibration methods typically involve using flashing patterns, reconstructing intensity images, and utilizing the features extracted from events. Existing methods are generally time-consuming and require manually placed calibration objects, which cannot meet the needs of rapidly changing scenarios. In this paper, we propose a line-based event camera calibration framework exploiting the geometric lines of commonly-encountered objects in man-made environments, e.g., doors, windows, boxes, etc. Different from previous methods, our method detects lines directly from event streams and leverages an event-line calibration model to generate the initial guess of camera parameters, which is suitable for both planar and non-planar lines. Then, a non-linear optimization is adopted to refine camera parameters. Both simulation and real-world experiments have demonstrated the feasibility and accuracy of our method, with validation performed on monocular and stereo event cameras.

*Zhicheng Zhao,Yuancheng Xu,Andong Lu,Chenglong Li,Jin Tang*

TL;DR: QDFNet is a quality-aware dynamic fusion network for robust optical-SAR object detection that handles missing or degraded modality data through learnable reference tokens and orthogonal constraint fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optical-SAR fusion for object detection faces practical deployment challenges due to distinct imaging mechanisms, temporal asynchrony, and registration difficulties, leading to missing or degraded modality data. Existing approaches lack robustness to random missing modalities and effective mechanisms for consistent performance improvement in fusion-based detection.

Method: Proposes Quality-Aware Dynamic Fusion Network (QDFNet) with two key modules: 1) Dynamic Modality Quality Assessment (DMQA) using learnable reference tokens to iteratively refine feature reliability assessment and identify degraded regions, and 2) Orthogonal Constraint Normalization Fusion (OCNF) employing orthogonal constraints to preserve modality independence while dynamically adjusting fusion weights based on reliability scores.

Result: Extensive experiments on SpaceNet6-OTD and OGSOD-2.0 datasets demonstrate QDFNet's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, particularly under partial modality corruption or missing data scenarios.

Conclusion: QDFNet effectively addresses the challenges of optical-SAR fusion by providing robust object detection through quality-aware dynamic fusion that handles missing or degraded modalities, offering a practical solution for all-weather remote sensing monitoring.

Abstract: Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) fusion-based object detection has attracted significant research interest in remote sensing, as these modalities provide complementary information for all-weather monitoring. However, practical deployment is severely limited by inherent challenges. Due to distinct imaging mechanisms, temporal asynchrony, and registration difficulties, obtaining well-aligned optical-SAR image pairs remains extremely difficult, frequently resulting in missing or degraded modality data. Although recent approaches have attempted to address this issue, they still suffer from limited robustness to random missing modalities and lack effective mechanisms to ensure consistent performance improvement in fusion-based detection. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Quality-Aware Dynamic Fusion Network (QDFNet) for robust optical-SAR object detection. Our proposed method leverages learnable reference tokens to dynamically assess feature reliability and guide adaptive fusion in the presence of missing modalities. In particular, we design a Dynamic Modality Quality Assessment (DMQA) module that employs learnable reference tokens to iteratively refine feature reliability assessment, enabling precise identification of degraded regions and providing quality guidance for subsequent fusion. Moreover, we develop an Orthogonal Constraint Normalization Fusion (OCNF) module that employs orthogonal constraints to preserve modality independence while dynamically adjusting fusion weights based on reliability scores, effectively suppressing unreliable feature propagation. Extensive experiments on the SpaceNet6-OTD and OGSOD-2.0 datasets demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of QDFNet compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly under partial modality corruption or missing data scenarios.

*Md Abu Obaida Zishan,Annajiat Alim Rasel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SonoVision is a smartphone app that helps visually impaired people locate everyday objects using directional sound cues through headphones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visually impaired individuals face significant challenges in locating objects, which hinders their independence and can lead to dangerous situations. There's a need to make them more self-sufficient and reduce reliance on others.

Method: Built with Flutter development platform, uses Efficientdet-D2 model for object detection. Provides directional audio cues: sinusoidal sounds in left/right ear for objects on respective sides, simultaneous sounds in both ears for objects directly in front.

Result: Developed a functional smartphone application that works completely offline, providing object location assistance through intuitive audio feedback. The app is available on GitHub for public access.

Conclusion: SonoVision can significantly assist visually impaired individuals in a safe, user-friendly manner by helping them locate everyday objects independently using audio cues, thereby increasing their self-sufficiency.

Abstract: Locating objects for the visually impaired is a significant challenge and is something no one can get used to over time. However, this hinders their independence and could push them towards risky and dangerous scenarios. Hence, in the spirit of making the visually challenged more self-sufficient, we present SonoVision, a smart-phone application that helps them find everyday objects using sound cues through earphones/headphones. This simply means, if an object is on the right or left side of a user, the app makes a sinusoidal sound in a user's respective ear through ear/headphones. However, to indicate objects located directly in front, both the left and right earphones are rung simultaneously. These sound cues could easily help a visually impaired individual locate objects with the help of their smartphones and reduce the reliance on people in their surroundings, consequently making them more independent. This application is made with the flutter development platform and uses the Efficientdet-D2 model for object detection in the backend. We believe the app will significantly assist the visually impaired in a safe and user-friendly manner with its capacity to work completely offline. Our application can be accessed here https://github.com/MohammedZ666/SonoVision.git.

Abstract: Monocular 3D building reconstruction from remote sensing imagery is essential for scalable urban modeling, yet existing methods often require task-specific architectures and intensive supervision. This paper presents the first systematic evaluation of SAM 3D, a general-purpose image-to-3D foundation model, for monocular remote sensing building reconstruction. We benchmark SAM 3D against TRELLIS on samples from the NYC Urban Dataset, employing Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and CLIP-based Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) as evaluation metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that SAM 3D produces more coherent roof geometry and sharper boundaries compared to TRELLIS. We further extend SAM 3D to urban scene reconstruction through a segment-reconstruct-compose pipeline, demonstrating its potential for urban scene modeling. We also analyze practical limitations and discuss future research directions. These findings provide practical guidance for deploying foundation models in urban 3D reconstruction and motivate future integration of scene-level structural priors.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Electrical substations are critical infrastructure vulnerable to various hazards, and manual mapping is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Autonomous computer vision solutions are needed for efficient vulnerability assessment and failure prevention.

Method: Train and compare three computer vision models (YOLOv8, YOLOv11, RF-DETR) on a manually labeled dataset of US substation images, evaluating detection accuracy, precision, and efficiency.

Result: The models are evaluated for their performance in detecting substation components, with key strengths and limitations identified to determine which provides reliable large-scale mapping capability.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates a practical use case for machine learning in substation mapping, identifying the most suitable model for autonomous, large-scale substation component detection to improve grid vulnerability assessment.

Abstract: Electrical substations are a significant component of an electrical grid. Indeed, the assets at these substations (e.g., transformers) are prone to disruption from many hazards, including hurricanes, flooding, earthquakes, and geomagnetically induced currents (GICs). As electrical grids are considered critical national infrastructure, any failure can have significant economic and public safety implications. To help prevent and mitigate these failures, it is thus essential that we identify key substation components to quantify vulnerability. Unfortunately, traditional manual mapping of substation infrastructure is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Therefore, an autonomous solution utilizing computer vision models is preferable, as it allows for greater convenience and efficiency. In this research paper, we train and compare the outputs of 3 models (YOLOv8, YOLOv11, RF-DETR) on a manually labeled dataset of US substation images. Each model is evaluated for detection accuracy, precision, and efficiency. We present the key strengths and limitations of each model, identifying which provides reliable and large-scale substation component mapping. Additionally, we utilize these models to effectively map the various substation components in the United States, showcasing a use case for machine learning in substation mapping.

Result: Achieves multi-angle shock wave measurement, motion field reconstruction, and explosive equivalence inversion with maximum error of 5.20% and minimum error of 0.06% compared to pressure sensors and empirical formulas.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates high-precision measurement of shock wave motion field with both high spatial and temporal resolution, representing significant progress in shock wave measurement technology.

Abstract: Accurate measurement of shock wave motion parameters with high spatiotemporal resolution is essential for applications such as power field testing and damage assessment. However, significant challenges are posed by the fast, uneven propagation of shock waves and unstable testing conditions. To address these challenges, a novel framework is proposed that utilizes multiple event cameras to estimate the asymmetry of shock waves, leveraging its high-speed and high-dynamic range capabilities. Initially, a polar coordinate system is established, which encodes events to reveal shock wave propagation patterns, with adaptive region-of-interest (ROI) extraction through event offset calculations. Subsequently, shock wave front events are extracted using iterative slope analysis, exploiting the continuity of velocity changes. Finally, the geometric model of events and shock wave motion parameters is derived according to event-based optical imaging model, along with the 3D reconstruction model. Through the above process, multi-angle shock wave measurement, motion field reconstruction, and explosive equivalence inversion are achieved. The results of the speed measurement are compared with those of the pressure sensors and the empirical formula, revealing a maximum error of 5.20% and a minimum error of 0.06%. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high-precision measurement of the shock wave motion field with both high spatial and temporal resolution, representing significant progress.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared small object detection requires expensive annotation, and existing methods like SAM suffer from domain gaps, inability to encode physical priors, and architectural complexity.

Method: Two-stage paradigm: 1) Prior-Guided Knowledge Distillation using hierarchical MoE adapter with 10% supervised data to create Scalpel-SAM expert teacher; 2) Deployment-Oriented Knowledge Transfer using Scalpel-SAM to generate pseudo labels for training lightweight downstream models.

Result: With minimal annotations, downstream models achieve performance comparable to or surpassing fully supervised counterparts, addressing data scarcity in IR-SOT.

Conclusion: First semi-supervised paradigm systematically addressing IR-SOT data scarcity using SAM as teacher model, enabling efficient deployment with minimal annotation costs.

Abstract: Infrared small object detection urgently requires semi-supervised paradigms due to the high cost of annotation. However, existing methods like SAM face significant challenges of domain gaps, inability of encoding physical priors, and inherent architectural complexity. To address this, we designed a Hierarchical MoE Adapter consisting of four white-box neural operators. Building upon this core component, we propose a two-stage paradigm for knowledge distillation and transfer: (1) Prior-Guided Knowledge Distillation, where we use our MoE adapter and 10% of available fully supervised data to distill SAM into an expert teacher (Scalpel-SAM); and (2) Deployment-Oriented Knowledge Transfer, where we use Scalpel-SAM to generate pseudo labels for training lightweight and efficient downstream models. Experiments demonstrate that with minimal annotations, our paradigm enables downstream models to achieve performance comparable to, or even surpassing, their fully supervised counterparts. To our knowledge, this is the first semi-supervised paradigm that systematically addresses the data scarcity issue in IR-SOT using SAM as the teacher model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-GMAE is a self-supervised video representation learning method that encodes video frames into moving Gaussian splats, enabling emergent tracking capabilities and achieving state-of-the-art performance on video understanding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a self-supervised approach for video representation learning that leverages the natural 3D structure of scenes. The key insight is that 2D videos are often projections of dynamic 3D scenes, so representing videos as sets of Gaussians moving over time provides a reasonable inductive bias that should facilitate learning meaningful representations.

Method: Video-GMAE uses a masked autoencoder architecture that encodes video sequences into sets of Gaussian splats that move over time. The method enforces the inductive bias that videos are projections of dynamic 3D scenes by representing them as Gaussians. The network learns to track objects implicitly during pretraining, with the Gaussian trajectories providing tracking information.

Result: The method demonstrates emergent tracking capabilities - mapping Gaussian trajectories to the image plane gives zero-shot tracking performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods. With finetuning, it achieves 34.6% improvement on Kinetics and 13.1% improvement on Kubric datasets, surpassing existing self-supervised video approaches.

Conclusion: Video-GMAE successfully demonstrates that representing videos as moving Gaussian splats provides an effective inductive bias for self-supervised video representation learning, enabling emergent tracking capabilities and achieving superior performance on video understanding benchmarks compared to existing self-supervised methods.

Abstract: We propose Video Gaussian Masked Autoencoders (Video-GMAE), a self-supervised approach for representation learning that encodes a sequence of images into a set of Gaussian splats moving over time. Representing a video as a set of Gaussians enforces a reasonable inductive bias: that 2-D videos are often consistent projections of a dynamic 3-D scene. We find that tracking emerges when pretraining a network with this architecture. Mapping the trajectory of the learnt Gaussians onto the image plane gives zero-shot tracking performance comparable to state-of-the-art. With small-scale finetuning, our models achieve 34.6% improvement on Kinetics, and 13.1% on Kubric datasets, surpassing existing self-supervised video approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text prompts alone often fail to capture users' intended edit locations and fine-grained visual details, limiting precise control in image editing and generation tasks.

Method: Proposes a joint input scheme feeding both original and scribbled source images with different colors, plus comprehensive data synthesis pipelines for scribble-based editing (4 tasks) and generation (3 tasks).

Result: DreamOmni3 achieves outstanding performance on comprehensive benchmarks for scribble-based editing and generation tasks.

Conclusion: The approach enables more flexible creation on GUI by combining text, images, and freehand sketches, with models and code to be publicly released to promote further research.

Abstract: Recently unified generation and editing models have achieved remarkable success with their impressive performance. These models rely mainly on text prompts for instruction-based editing and generation, but language often fails to capture users intended edit locations and fine-grained visual details. To this end, we propose two tasks: scribble-based editing and generation, that enables more flexible creation on graphical user interface (GUI) combining user textual, images, and freehand sketches. We introduce DreamOmni3, tackling two challenges: data creation and framework design. Our data synthesis pipeline includes two parts: scribble-based editing and generation. For scribble-based editing, we define four tasks: scribble and instruction-based editing, scribble and multimodal instruction-based editing, image fusion, and doodle editing. Based on DreamOmni2 dataset, we extract editable regions and overlay hand-drawn boxes, circles, doodles or cropped image to construct training data. For scribble-based generation, we define three tasks: scribble and instruction-based generation, scribble and multimodal instruction-based generation, and doodle generation, following similar data creation pipelines. For the framework, instead of using binary masks, which struggle with complex edits involving multiple scribbles, images, and instructions, we propose a joint input scheme that feeds both the original and scribbled source images into the model, using different colors to distinguish regions and simplify processing. By applying the same index and position encodings to both images, the model can precisely localize scribbled regions while maintaining accurate editing. Finally, we establish comprehensive benchmarks for these tasks to promote further research. Experimental results demonstrate that DreamOmni3 achieves outstanding performance, and models and code will be publicly released.

TL;DR: CoAgent is a collaborative closed-loop framework for coherent long-form video generation that addresses identity drift and scene inconsistency through a plan-synthesize-verify pipeline with entity memory management and selective regeneration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-video models treat shots independently, causing identity drift, scene inconsistency, and unstable temporal structure in open-domain video generation.

Method: Plan-synthesize-verify pipeline: Storyboard Planner decomposes prompts into shot-level plans, Global Context Manager maintains entity memory, Synthesis Module generates shots with Visual Consistency Controller, Verifier Agent detects inconsistencies for selective regeneration, and pacing-aware editor refines temporal flow.

Result: Extensive experiments show CoAgent significantly improves coherence, visual consistency, and narrative quality in long-form video generation compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: CoAgent's collaborative closed-loop framework effectively addresses coherence challenges in open-domain video generation through structured planning, entity memory management, and consistency verification mechanisms.

Abstract: Maintaining narrative coherence and visual consistency remains a central challenge in open-domain video generation. Existing text-to-video models often treat each shot independently, resulting in identity drift, scene inconsistency, and unstable temporal structure. We propose CoAgent, a collaborative and closed-loop framework for coherent video generation that formulates the process as a plan-synthesize-verify pipeline. Given a user prompt, style reference, and pacing constraints, a Storyboard Planner decomposes the input into structured shot-level plans with explicit entities, spatial relations, and temporal cues. A Global Context Manager maintains entity-level memory to preserve appearance and identity consistency across shots. Each shot is then generated by a Synthesis Module under the guidance of a Visual Consistency Controller, while a Verifier Agent evaluates intermediate results using vision-language reasoning and triggers selective regeneration when inconsistencies are detected. Finally, a pacing-aware editor refines temporal rhythm and transitions to match the desired narrative flow. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoAgent significantly improves coherence, visual consistency, and narrative quality in long-form video generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SR-MCR is a lightweight, label-free framework that improves multimodal LLM reasoning reliability by using self-referential cues from model outputs to align intermediate reasoning steps, achieving state-of-the-art performance on visual benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal LLMs produce fluent but unreliable reasoning with weak step-to-step coherence and insufficient visual grounding, because current alignment approaches only supervise final answers while ignoring intermediate reasoning reliability.

Method: SR-MCR uses five self-referential cues (semantic alignment, lexical fidelity, non-redundancy, visual grounding, step consistency) to create a normalized reliability-weighted reward for fine-grained process-level guidance. It employs a critic-free GRPO objective with confidence-aware cooling mechanism to stabilize training and suppress trivial/overconfident generations.

Result: Built on Qwen2.5-VL, SR-MCR improves both answer accuracy and reasoning coherence across visual benchmarks. SR-MCR-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance among comparable open-source models with 81.4% average accuracy. Ablation studies confirm contributions of each reward term and cooling module.

Conclusion: SR-MCR provides an effective label-free framework for aligning multimodal reasoning by exploiting intrinsic process signals, addressing the reliability gap in intermediate reasoning while maintaining lightweight implementation.

Abstract: Multimodal LLMs often produce fluent yet unreliable reasoning, exhibiting weak step-to-step coherence and insufficient visual grounding, largely because existing alignment approaches supervise only the final answer while ignoring the reliability of the intermediate reasoning process. We introduce SR-MCR, a lightweight and label-free framework that aligns reasoning by exploiting intrinsic process signals derived directly from model outputs. Five self-referential cues -- semantic alignment, lexical fidelity, non-redundancy, visual grounding, and step consistency -- are integrated into a normalized, reliability-weighted reward that provides fine-grained process-level guidance. A critic-free GRPO objective, enhanced with a confidence-aware cooling mechanism, further stabilizes training and suppresses trivial or overly confident generations. Built on Qwen2.5-VL, SR-MCR improves both answer accuracy and reasoning coherence across a broad set of visual benchmarks; among open-source models of comparable size, SR-MCR-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 81.4%. Ablation studies confirm the independent contributions of each reward term and the cooling module.

Conclusion: The proposed ReFRM3D network and multi-feature classifier significantly improve glioma segmentation and classification performance, addressing key challenges in brain tumor characterization.

Abstract: Gliomas are among the most aggressive cancers, characterized by high mortality rates and complex diagnostic processes. Existing studies on glioma diagnosis and classification often describe issues such as high variability in imaging data, inadequate optimization of computational resources, and inefficient segmentation and classification of gliomas. To address these challenges, we propose novel techniques utilizing multi-parametric MRI data to enhance tumor segmentation and classification efficiency. Our work introduces the first-ever radiomics-enhanced fused residual multiparametric 3D network (ReFRM3D) for brain tumor characterization, which is based on a 3D U-Net architecture and features multi-scale feature fusion, hybrid upsampling, and an extended residual skip mechanism. Additionally, we propose a multi-feature tumor marker-based classifier that leverages radiomic features extracted from the segmented regions. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in segmentation performance across the BraTS2019, BraTS2020, and BraTS2021 datasets, achieving high Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) of 94.04%, 92.68%, and 93.64% for whole tumor (WT), enhancing tumor (ET), and tumor core (TC) respectively in BraTS2019; 94.09%, 92.91%, and 93.84% in BraTS2020; and 93.70%, 90.36%, and 92.13% in BraTS2021.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KV-Tracker enables real-time 6-DoF pose tracking and online reconstruction from monocular RGB videos by caching key-value pairs from multi-view geometry networks, achieving 15× speedup without drift or forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-view 3D geometry networks provide strong priors but are too slow for real-time applications like pose tracking and online reconstruction from monocular RGB videos.

Method: The method selects/manages keyframes for scene mapping via π³ with bidirectional attention, caches global self-attention KV pairs as the sole scene representation, and uses this for online tracking. The caching strategy is model-agnostic and doesn't require retraining.

Result: Achieves up to 15× speedup during inference, maintains high frame rates (~27 FPS), and demonstrates strong performance on TUM RGB-D, 7-Scenes, Arctic, and OnePose datasets for both scene-level and object tracking/reconstruction without depth or object priors.

Conclusion: KV-Tracker successfully adapts powerful multi-view geometry networks for real-time applications by caching attention KV pairs, enabling fast, drift-free pose tracking and online reconstruction from monocular RGB videos.

Abstract: Multi-view 3D geometry networks offer a powerful prior but are prohibitively slow for real-time applications. We propose a novel way to adapt them for online use, enabling real-time 6-DoF pose tracking and online reconstruction of objects and scenes from monocular RGB videos. Our method rapidly selects and manages a set of images as keyframes to map a scene or object via $π^3$ with full bidirectional attention. We then cache the global self-attention block's key-value (KV) pairs and use them as the sole scene representation for online tracking. This allows for up to $15\times$ speedup during inference without the fear of drift or catastrophic forgetting. Our caching strategy is model-agnostic and can be applied to other off-the-shelf multi-view networks without retraining. We demonstrate KV-Tracker on both scene-level tracking and the more challenging task of on-the-fly object tracking and reconstruction without depth measurements or object priors. Experiments on the TUM RGB-D, 7-Scenes, Arctic and OnePose datasets show the strong performance of our system while maintaining high frame-rates up to ${\sim}27$ FPS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PTalker: A novel framework for personalized 3D talking head animation that preserves individual speaking styles through style disentanglement and enhances lip-sync accuracy via three-level audio-mesh alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speech-driven 3D talking head methods focus on lip-sync accuracy but overlook individual speaking style nuances, limiting personalization and realism. The paper addresses this gap by developing a framework that captures both accurate lip synchronization and personalized speaking styles.

Method: PTalker uses style disentanglement constraints to separate style and content from audio and facial motion sequences. It employs a three-level alignment mechanism: 1) spatial alignment using Graph Attention Networks for 3D mesh structure, 2) temporal alignment using cross-attention for synchronization, and 3) feature alignment with top-k bidirectional contrastive losses and KL divergence constraints.

Result: Extensive experiments on public datasets show PTalker effectively generates realistic, stylized 3D talking heads that accurately match identity-specific speaking styles, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: PTalker successfully addresses the limitation of existing methods by preserving individual speaking styles while maintaining high lip-synchronization accuracy, advancing personalized 3D talking head animation toward greater realism and personalization.

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D talking head generation aims to produce lifelike facial animations precisely synchronized with speech. While considerable progress has been made in achieving high lip-synchronization accuracy, existing methods largely overlook the intricate nuances of individual speaking styles, which limits personalization and realism. In this work, we present a novel framework for personalized 3D talking head animation, namely "PTalker". This framework preserves speaking style through style disentanglement from audio and facial motion sequences and enhances lip-synchronization accuracy through a three-level alignment mechanism between audio and mesh modalities. Specifically, to effectively disentangle style and content, we design disentanglement constraints that encode driven audio and motion sequences into distinct style and content spaces to enhance speaking style representation. To improve lip-synchronization accuracy, we adopt a modality alignment mechanism incorporating three aspects: spatial alignment using Graph Attention Networks to capture vertex connectivity in the 3D mesh structure, temporal alignment using cross-attention to capture and synchronize temporal dependencies, and feature alignment by top-k bidirectional contrastive losses and KL divergence constraints to ensure consistency between speech and mesh modalities. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on public datasets demonstrate that PTalker effectively generates realistic, stylized 3D talking heads that accurately match identity-specific speaking styles, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

*Dafeng Zhang,Yongqi Song,Shizhuo Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes SDT (Sparse Differential Transformer) with prediction-driven Top-K Jaccard similarity for face clustering, achieving SOTA performance by enhancing neighbor purity and reducing noise in similarity measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing face clustering methods using Jaccard similarity introduce too many irrelevant nodes, producing coefficients with limited discriminative power and adversely affecting clustering performance. Current approaches struggle with predicting optimal Top-K neighbors and vanilla Transformers introduce noise by overemphasizing irrelevant feature relationships.

Method: 1) Prediction-driven Top-K Jaccard similarity coefficient to enhance neighbor purity; 2) Transformer-based prediction model to examine relationships between central node and neighbors near Top-K; 3) Sparse Differential Transformer (SDT) instead of vanilla Transformer to eliminate noise and enhance anti-noise capabilities.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple datasets including MS-Celeb-1M demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods and providing more robust face clustering solutions.

Conclusion: The proposed SDT with prediction-driven Top-K Jaccard similarity effectively addresses noise issues in similarity measurement, enhances neighbor purity, and achieves superior face clustering performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: The method used to measure relationships between face embeddings plays a crucial role in determining the performance of face clustering. Existing methods employ the Jaccard similarity coefficient instead of the cosine distance to enhance the measurement accuracy. However, these methods introduce too many irrelevant nodes, producing Jaccard coefficients with limited discriminative power and adversely affecting clustering performance. To address this issue, we propose a prediction-driven Top-K Jaccard similarity coefficient that enhances the purity of neighboring nodes, thereby improving the reliability of similarity measurements. Nevertheless, accurately predicting the optimal number of neighbors (Top-K) remains challenging, leading to suboptimal clustering results. To overcome this limitation, we develop a Transformer-based prediction model that examines the relationships between the central node and its neighboring nodes near the Top-K to further enhance the reliability of similarity estimation. However, vanilla Transformer, when applied to predict relationships between nodes, often introduces noise due to their overemphasis on irrelevant feature relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a Sparse Differential Transformer (SDT), instead of the vanilla Transformer, to eliminate noise and enhance the model's anti-noise capabilities. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, such as MS-Celeb-1M, demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, outperforming existing methods and providing a more robust solution for face clustering.

TL;DR: Dream-VL is a diffusion-based vision-language model that outperforms autoregressive models on visual planning tasks, and Dream-VLA extends this to vision-language-action with superior robotic control performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive VLMs have limitations in complex visual planning and robotic control due to sequential generation. The authors investigate diffusion-based LLMs as a better foundation for these tasks.

Method: Developed Dream-VL as an open diffusion-based VLM, then extended to Dream-VLA through continuous pre-training on open robotic datasets. Leverages the bidirectional nature of diffusion models for parallel generation and action chunking.

Result: Dream-VL achieves SOTA among dVLMs and comparable to top AR-based VLMs. Dream-VLA achieves 97.2% success on LIBERO, 71.4% on SimplerEnv-Bridge, and 60.5% on SimplerEnv-Fractal, surpassing leading models like π₀ and GR00T-N1.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based VLMs/VLAs offer superior performance for visual planning and robotic control tasks compared to autoregressive models, with faster convergence and better parallel generation capabilities.

Abstract: While autoregressive Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success, their sequential generation often limits their efficacy in complex visual planning and dynamic robotic control. In this work, we investigate the potential of constructing Vision-Language Models upon diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) to overcome these limitations. We introduce Dream-VL, an open diffusion-based VLM (dVLM) that achieves state-of-the-art performance among previous dVLMs. Dream-VL is comparable to top-tier AR-based VLMs trained on open data on various benchmarks but exhibits superior potential when applied to visual planning tasks. Building upon Dream-VL, we introduce Dream-VLA, a dLLM-based Vision-Language-Action model (dVLA) developed through continuous pre-training on open robotic datasets. We demonstrate that the natively bidirectional nature of this diffusion backbone serves as a superior foundation for VLA tasks, inherently suited for action chunking and parallel generation, leading to significantly faster convergence in downstream fine-tuning. Dream-VLA achieves top-tier performance of 97.2% average success rate on LIBERO, 71.4% overall average on SimplerEnv-Bridge, and 60.5% overall average on SimplerEnv-Fractal, surpassing leading models such as $π_0$ and GR00T-N1. We also validate that dVLMs surpass AR baselines on downstream tasks across different training objectives. We release both Dream-VL and Dream-VLA to facilitate further research in the community.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Systematic study of memory mechanisms in SAM-based visual object tracking, analyzing SAM2 trackers, implementing memory designs in SAM3, and proposing a unified hybrid memory framework that improves robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SAM-based tracking methods address memory limitations in method-specific ways without understanding broader design principles, and it's unclear how these mechanisms transfer to next-generation models like SAM3.

Method: 1) Analyze representative SAM2-based trackers to identify common patterns; 2) Faithfully reimplement memory mechanisms within SAM3 framework; 3) Conduct large-scale evaluations across 10 benchmarks; 4) Propose unified hybrid memory framework decomposing memory into short-term appearance and long-term distractor-resolving components.

Result: Analysis shows most SAM2 trackers primarily differ in short-term memory frame selection while sharing common object-centric representation. The proposed hybrid memory framework consistently improves robustness under long-term occlusion, complex motion, and distractor-heavy scenarios on both SAM2 and SAM3 backbones.

Conclusion: Memory design principles are crucial for SAM-based tracking, and the proposed unified hybrid memory framework provides a modular, principled approach that enhances robustness across challenging scenarios, with code available for further research.

Abstract: \noindent Memory has become the central mechanism enabling robust visual object tracking in modern segmentation-based frameworks. Recent methods built upon Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) have demonstrated strong performance by refining how past observations are stored and reused. However, existing approaches address memory limitations in a method-specific manner, leaving the broader design principles of memory in SAM-based tracking poorly understood. Moreover, it remains unclear how these memory mechanisms transfer to stronger, next-generation foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3). In this work, we present a systematic memory-centric study of SAM-based visual object tracking. We first analyze representative SAM2-based trackers and show that most methods primarily differ in how short-term memory frames are selected, while sharing a common object-centric representation. Building on this insight, we faithfully reimplement these memory mechanisms within the SAM3 framework and conduct large-scale evaluations across ten diverse benchmarks, enabling a controlled analysis of memory design independent of backbone strength. Guided by our empirical findings, we propose a unified hybrid memory framework that explicitly decomposes memory into short-term appearance memory and long-term distractor-resolving memory. This decomposition enables the integration of existing memory policies in a modular and principled manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently improves robustness under long-term occlusion, complex motion, and distractor-heavy scenarios on both SAM2 and SAM3 backbones.

TL;DR: Envision is a two-stage diffusion framework for embodied visual planning that generates goal-aligned video trajectories by first synthesizing a goal image and then interpolating between start and goal states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video diffusion models for embodied planning are forward predictive without explicit goal modeling, leading to spatial drift and goal misalignment. There's a need for goal-constrained visual planning that ensures physical plausibility and goal consistency.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Goal Imagery Model identifies task-relevant regions and synthesizes coherent goal images using region-aware cross attention; 2) Env-Goal Video Model (based on FL2V - first-and-last-frame-conditioned video diffusion) interpolates between initial observation and goal image to produce smooth, physically plausible video trajectories.

Result: Superior goal alignment, spatial consistency, and object preservation compared to baselines on object manipulation and image editing benchmarks. The generated visual plans provide reliable guidance for downstream robotic planning and control.

Conclusion: Envision effectively addresses goal misalignment in embodied visual planning by explicitly constraining generation with goal images, producing physically plausible trajectories that can directly support robotic planning and control tasks.

Abstract: Embodied visual planning aims to enable manipulation tasks by imagining how a scene evolves toward a desired goal and using the imagined trajectories to guide actions. Video diffusion models, through their image-to-video generation capability, provide a promising foundation for such visual imagination. However, existing approaches are largely forward predictive, generating trajectories conditioned on the initial observation without explicit goal modeling, thus often leading to spatial drift and goal misalignment. To address these challenges, we propose Envision, a diffusion-based framework that performs visual planning for embodied agents. By explicitly constraining the generation with a goal image, our method enforces physical plausibility and goal consistency throughout the generated trajectory. Specifically, Envision operates in two stages. First, a Goal Imagery Model identifies task-relevant regions, performs region-aware cross attention between the scene and the instruction, and synthesizes a coherent goal image that captures the desired outcome. Then, an Env-Goal Video Model, built upon a first-and-last-frame-conditioned video diffusion model (FL2V), interpolates between the initial observation and the goal image, producing smooth and physically plausible video trajectories that connect the start and goal states. Experiments on object manipulation and image editing benchmarks demonstrate that Envision achieves superior goal alignment, spatial consistency, and object preservation compared to baselines. The resulting visual plans can directly support downstream robotic planning and control, providing reliable guidance for embodied agents.

TL;DR: Proposes FinPercep-RM (fine-grained perceptual reward model) with degradation maps and Co-evolutionary Curriculum Learning to address reward hacking in RLHF for Image Super-Resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional IQA models output single global scores insensitive to local distortions, allowing ISR models to produce artifacts that get high scores (reward hacking), misaligning optimization with perceptual quality.

Method: 1) FinPercep-RM: Encoder-Decoder architecture providing global quality scores plus Perceptual Degradation Maps for spatial localization of defects. 2) FGR-30k dataset with diverse distortions. 3) Co-evolutionary Curriculum Learning: synchronized curricula where reward model complexity increases while ISR model starts with simple global reward, gradually transitioning to complex outputs.

Result: Experiments validate effectiveness across ISR models in both global quality and local realism on RLHF methods, enabling stable training while suppressing reward hacking.

Conclusion: The proposed FinPercep-RM with CCL mechanism successfully addresses reward hacking in RLHF for ISR by providing fine-grained perceptual feedback and enabling stable training through synchronized curriculum learning.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has proven effective in image generation field guided by reward models to align human preferences. Motivated by this, adapting RLHF for Image Super-Resolution (ISR) tasks has shown promise in optimizing perceptual quality with Image Quality Assessment (IQA) model as reward models. However, the traditional IQA model usually output a single global score, which are exceptionally insensitive to local and fine-grained distortions. This insensitivity allows ISR models to produce perceptually undesirable artifacts that yield spurious high scores, misaligning optimization objectives with perceptual quality and results in reward hacking. To address this, we propose a Fine-grained Perceptual Reward Model (FinPercep-RM) based on an Encoder-Decoder architecture. While providing a global quality score, it also generates a Perceptual Degradation Map that spatially localizes and quantifies local defects. We specifically introduce the FGR-30k dataset to train this model, consisting of diverse and subtle distortions from real-world super-resolution models. Despite the success of the FinPercep-RM model, its complexity introduces significant challenges in generator policy learning, leading to training instability. To address this, we propose a Co-evolutionary Curriculum Learning (CCL) mechanism, where both the reward model and the ISR model undergo synchronized curricula. The reward model progressively increases in complexity, while the ISR model starts with a simpler global reward for rapid convergence, gradually transitioning to the more complex model outputs. This easy-to-hard strategy enables stable training while suppressing reward hacking. Experiments validates the effectiveness of our method across ISR models in both global quality and local realism on RLHF methods.

TL;DR: Deep learning models for automated LVEF estimation from echocardiography videos achieve RMSE of 6.79% with modified 3D Inception architectures performing best, though overfitting remains a challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual LVEF assessment from echocardiograms is time-consuming and has high inter-observer variability, creating need for automated deep learning solutions that can match expert performance.

Method: Systematic evaluation of multiple deep learning architectures (3D Inception, two-stream, CNN-RNN models) on EchoNet-Dynamic dataset (10,030 videos), with architectural modifications and fusion strategies to optimize prediction accuracy.

Result: Modified 3D Inception architectures achieved best performance with RMSE of 6.79%. Smaller/simpler models showed better generalization, and performance was highly sensitive to hyperparameters like kernel sizes and normalization strategies.

Conclusion: Deep learning can effectively automate LVEF estimation from echocardiography, with architectural insights applicable to broader video analysis tasks, though overfitting and hyperparameter sensitivity remain challenges.

Abstract: Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is a key indicator of cardiac function and plays a central role in the diagnosis and management of cardiovascular disease. Echocardiography, as a readily accessible and non-invasive imaging modality, is widely used in clinical practice to estimate LVEF. However, manual assessment of cardiac function from echocardiograms is time-consuming and subject to considerable inter-observer variability. Deep learning approaches offer a promising alternative, with the potential to achieve performance comparable to that of experienced human experts. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of several deep learning architectures for LVEF estimation from echocardiography videos, including 3D Inception, two-stream, and CNN-RNN models. We systematically evaluate architectural modifications and fusion strategies to identify configurations that maximize prediction accuracy. Models were trained and evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, comprising 10,030 echocardiogram videos. Our results demonstrate that modified 3D Inception architectures achieve the best overall performance, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 6.79%. Across architectures, we observe a tendency toward overfitting, with smaller and simpler models generally exhibiting improved generalization. Model performance was also found to be highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices, particularly convolutional kernel sizes and normalization strategies. While this study focuses on echocardiography-based LVEF estimation, the insights gained regarding architectural design and training strategies may be applicable to a broader range of medical and non-medical video analysis tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While large-scale datasets and pre-trained models provide substantial knowledge, many downstream tasks in specialized scientific domains remain challenging due to data limitations, requiring effective adaptation methods.

Method: CLAdapter introduces attention mechanisms and cluster centers to personalize feature enhancement through distribution correlation and transformation matrices, enabling models to learn distinct representations for different feature sets. It features a unified interface compatible with CNNs and Transformers in both 2D and 3D contexts.

Result: Extensive experiments on 10 datasets across diverse domains (generic, biological, medical, industrial, agricultural, environmental, geographical, materials science, OOD, and 3D) show CLAdapter achieves state-of-the-art performance in data-limited scientific domains.

Conclusion: CLAdapter effectively unleashes the potential of foundation vision models through adaptive transfer, demonstrating strong performance across diverse data-limited scientific applications with a unified architecture.

Abstract: In the big data era, the computer vision field benefits from large-scale datasets such as LAION-2B, LAION-400M, and ImageNet-21K, Kinetics, on which popular models like the ViT and ConvNeXt series have been pre-trained, acquiring substantial knowledge. However, numerous downstream tasks in specialized and data-limited scientific domains continue to pose significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel Cluster Attention Adapter (CLAdapter), which refines and adapts the rich representations learned from large-scale data to various data-limited downstream tasks.

*ZhenQi Chen,TsaiChing Ni,YuanFu Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CritiFusion improves text-to-image diffusion models by adding inference-time semantic critique and frequency-domain refinement without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image diffusion models achieve good visual quality but often fail to maintain semantic alignment with complex prompts, needing better prompt fidelity.

Method: Uses CritiCore module with vision-language and large language models for semantic feedback, plus SpecFusion for spectral domain refinement of intermediate generation states.

Result: Improves text-to-image correspondence metrics, human preference scores, and aesthetic evaluations, matching state-of-the-art reward optimization approaches.

Conclusion: CritiFusion effectively enhances semantic alignment and visual quality through semantic critique and spectral refinement as a plug-in refinement stage.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable visual fidelity but often struggle with semantic alignment to complex prompts. We introduce CritiFusion, a novel inference-time framework that integrates a multimodal semantic critique mechanism with frequency-domain refinement to improve text-to-image consistency and detail. The proposed CritiCore module leverages a vision-language model and multiple large language models to enrich the prompt context and produce high-level semantic feedback, guiding the diffusion process to better align generated content with the prompt's intent. Additionally, SpecFusion merges intermediate generation states in the spectral domain, injecting coarse structural information while preserving high-frequency details. No additional model training is required. CritiFusion serves as a plug-in refinement stage compatible with existing diffusion backbones. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our method notably improves human-aligned metrics of text-to-image correspondence and visual quality. CritiFusion consistently boosts performance on human preference scores and aesthetic evaluations, achieving results on par with state-of-the-art reward optimization approaches. Qualitative results further demonstrate superior detail, realism, and prompt fidelity, indicating the effectiveness of our semantic critique and spectral alignment strategy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multimodal diffeomorphic registration using Neural ODEs with structural descriptors for instance-specific, training-free registration across modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing nonrigid registration methods face tradeoffs between accuracy, computational complexity, and regularization. They also assume intensity correlation in homologous regions, limiting them to monomodal settings. Learning-based models require extensive training data and suffer performance degradation on unseen modalities.

Method: Proposes an instance-specific framework using Neural ODEs with structural descriptors as modality-agnostic metrics. Three variants integrate image-based or feature-based structural descriptors and nonstructural image similarities via local mutual information.

Result: Surpassing qualitative and quantitative results compared to state-of-the-art baselines for both large and small deformations. Demonstrates robustness to varying regularization levels, suitability for registration at varying scales, and efficiency compared to other large-deformation methods.

Conclusion: The proposed Neural ODE-based multimodal registration framework provides an effective, instance-specific solution that overcomes limitations of traditional intensity-based methods and learning-based approaches, offering robust performance across modalities without requiring extensive training data.

Abstract: This work proposes a multimodal diffeomorphic registration method using Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs). Nonrigid registration algorithms exhibit tradeoffs between their accuracy, the computational complexity of their deformation model, and its proper regularization. In addition, they also assume intensity correlation in anatomically homologous regions of interest among image pairs, limiting their applicability to the monomodal setting. Unlike learning-based models, we propose an instance-specific framework that is not subject to high scan requirements for training and does not suffer performance degradation at inference time on modalities unseen during training. Our method exploits the potential of continuous-depth networks in the Neural ODE paradigm with structural descriptors, widely adopted as modality-agnostic metric models which exploit self-similarities on parameterized neighborhood geometries. We propose three different variants that integrate image-based or feature-based structural descriptors and nonstructural image similarities computed by local mutual information. We conduct extensive evaluations on different experiments formed by scan dataset combinations and show surpassing qualitative and quantitative results compared to state-of-the-art baselines adequate for large or small deformations, and specific of multimodal registration. Lastly, we also demonstrate the underlying robustness of the proposed framework to varying levels of explicit regularization while maintaining low error, its suitability for registration at varying scales, and its efficiency with respect to other methods targeted to large-deformation registration.

### [73] [SCPainter: A Unified Framework for Realistic 3D Asset Insertion and Novel View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22706)
*Paul Dobre,Jackson Cooper,Xin Wang,Hongzhou Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCPainter is a unified framework that combines 3D Gaussian Splat car assets with diffusion models to enable realistic 3D asset insertion and novel view synthesis for autonomous driving simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving needs diverse training data covering long-tailed scenarios. Current methods treat 3D asset insertion and novel view synthesis separately, lacking realistic integration and interaction capabilities needed for comprehensive simulation.

Method: SCPainter integrates 3D Gaussian Splat car asset representations with 3D scene point clouds, projects them into novel views, and uses these projections to condition a diffusion model for high-quality image generation.

Result: Evaluation on Waymo Open Dataset demonstrates the framework's capability to enable realistic 3D asset insertion and novel view synthesis, facilitating creation of diverse and realistic driving data.

Conclusion: SCPainter provides a unified solution that combines realistic 3D asset insertion with novel view synthesis, enabling more comprehensive and diverse autonomous driving simulation for improved model training.

Abstract: 3D Asset insertion and novel view synthesis (NVS) are key components for autonomous driving simulation, enhancing the diversity of training data. With better training data that is diverse and covers a wide range of situations, including long-tailed driving scenarios, autonomous driving models can become more robust and safer. This motivates a unified simulation framework that can jointly handle realistic integration of inserted 3D assets and NVS. Recent 3D asset reconstruction methods enable reconstruction of dynamic actors from video, supporting their re-insertion into simulated driving scenes. While the overall structure and appearance can be accurate, it still struggles to capture the realism of 3D assets through lighting or shadows, particularly when inserted into scenes. In parallel, recent advances in NVS methods have demonstrated promising results in synthesizing viewpoints beyond the originally recorded trajectories. However, existing approaches largely treat asset insertion and NVS capabilities in isolation. To allow for interaction with the rest of the scene and to enable more diverse creation of new scenarios for training, realistic 3D asset insertion should be combined with NVS. To address this, we present SCPainter (Street Car Painter), a unified framework which integrates 3D Gaussian Splat (GS) car asset representations and 3D scene point clouds with diffusion-based generation to jointly enable realistic 3D asset insertion and NVS. The 3D GS assets and 3D scene point clouds are projected together into novel views, and these projections are used to condition a diffusion model to generate high quality images. Evaluation on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate the capability of our framework to enable 3D asset insertion and NVS, facilitating the creation of diverse and realistic driving data.

TL;DR: Self-supervised pretraining (USF-MAE) on 370K+ unlabeled ultrasound images improves automated cystic hygroma detection over supervised DenseNet-169 baseline, achieving 0.98 ROC-AUC with statistically significant gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cystic hygroma detection is crucial for prenatal screening but supervised deep learning is limited by small labeled datasets. Self-supervised pretraining on large unlabeled ultrasound data could enable more accurate and robust automated detection.

Method: Fine-tuned Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE), pretrained on 370K+ unlabeled ultrasound images, for binary classification of cystic hygroma vs normal controls. Used same dataset, preprocessing, and 4-fold cross-validation as DenseNet-169 baseline. Evaluated with accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, ROC-AUC, and Score-CAM visualizations for interpretability.

Result: USF-MAE outperformed DenseNet-169 on all metrics: mean accuracy 0.96 vs 0.93, sensitivity 0.94 vs 0.92, specificity 0.98 vs 0.94, ROC-AUC 0.98 vs 0.94. Score-CAM visualizations showed clinically relevant attention to fetal neck regions. Performance improvements were statistically significant (p = 0.0057).

Conclusion: Ultrasound-specific self-supervised pretraining enables more accurate and robust automated detection of cystic hygroma in first-trimester ultrasound images, addressing limitations of small labeled datasets and supporting scalable early screening programs.

Abstract: Cystic hygroma is a high-risk prenatal ultrasound finding that portends high rates of chromosomal abnormalities, structural malformations, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Automated detection can increase reproducibility and support scalable early screening programs, but supervised deep learning methods are limited by small labelled datasets. This study assesses whether ultrasound-specific self-supervised pretraining can facilitate accurate, robust deep learning detection of cystic hygroma in first-trimester ultrasound images. We fine-tuned the Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE), pretrained on over 370,000 unlabelled ultrasound images, for binary classification of normal controls and cystic hygroma cases used in this study. Performance was evaluated on the same curated ultrasound dataset, preprocessing pipeline, and 4-fold cross-validation protocol as for the DenseNet-169 baseline, using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC). Model interpretability was analyzed qualitatively using Score-CAM visualizations. USF-MAE outperformed the DenseNet-169 baseline on all evaluation metrics. The proposed model yielded a mean accuracy of 0.96, sensitivity of 0.94, specificity of 0.98, and ROC-AUC of 0.98 compared to 0.93, 0.92, 0.94, and 0.94 for the DenseNet-169 baseline, respectively. Qualitative Score-CAM visualizations of model predictions demonstrated clinical relevance by highlighting expected regions in the fetal neck for both positive and negative cases. Paired statistical analysis using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test confirmed that performance improvements achieved by USF-MAE were statistically significant (p = 0.0057).

TL;DR: Freetime FeatureGS enables decomposed 4D scene reconstruction from multi-view videos without relying on video segmentation, using Gaussian primitives with learnable features and temporal motion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on video segmentation results which are often unstable and lead to unreliable reconstruction. The paper aims to overcome this limitation by eliminating the need for video segmentation entirely.

Method: Uses Freetime FeatureGS - Gaussian primitives with learnable features and linear motion ability. Applies contrastive loss based on 2D segmentation maps, extends feature learning to temporal dimension via motion, and uses streaming feature learning with temporally ordered sampling.

Result: Experimental results show reconstruction quality outperforms recent methods by a large margin on several datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully achieves decomposed 4D scene reconstruction without relying on video segmentation, using streaming feature learning with Gaussian primitives that can move over time.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of decomposed 4D scene reconstruction from multi-view videos. Recent methods achieve this by lifting video segmentation results to a 4D representation through differentiable rendering techniques. Therefore, they heavily rely on the quality of video segmentation maps, which are often unstable, leading to unreliable reconstruction results. To overcome this challenge, our key idea is to represent the decomposed 4D scene with the Freetime FeatureGS and design a streaming feature learning strategy to accurately recover it from per-image segmentation maps, eliminating the need for video segmentation. Freetime FeatureGS models the dynamic scene as a set of Gaussian primitives with learnable features and linear motion ability, allowing them to move to neighboring regions over time. We apply a contrastive loss to Freetime FeatureGS, forcing primitive features to be close or far apart based on whether their projections belong to the same instance in the 2D segmentation map. As our Gaussian primitives can move across time, it naturally extends the feature learning to the temporal dimension, achieving 4D segmentation. Furthermore, we sample observations for training in a temporally ordered manner, enabling the streaming propagation of features over time and effectively avoiding local minima during the optimization process. Experimental results on several datasets show that the reconstruction quality of our method outperforms recent methods by a large margin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adaptive visual token pruning method for LMMs in long-context multi-image settings that reduces inference cost while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual token pruning methods overlook challenges in long context inputs with multiple images, where growing visual tokens greatly increase inference costs for Large Multimodal Models.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Intra-image stage allocates content-aware token budgets and greedily selects representative tokens per image; 2) Inter-image stage performs global diversity filtering and Pareto selection balancing diversity with text alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach maintains strong performance in long context settings while significantly reducing the number of visual tokens.

Conclusion: The adaptive pruning method effectively addresses visual token redundancy in multi-image long-context scenarios, enabling more efficient LMM inference without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have proven effective on various tasks. They typically encode visual inputs into Original Model sequences of tokens, which are then concatenated with textual tokens and jointly processed by the language model. However, the growing number of visual tokens greatly increases inference cost. Visual token pruning has emerged as a promising solution. However, existing methods often overlook scenarios involving long context inputs with multiple images. In this paper, we analyze the challenges of visual token pruning in long context, multi-image settings and introduce an adaptive pruning method tailored for such scenarios. We decompose redundancy into intra-image and inter-image components and quantify them through intra-image diversity and inter-image variation, which jointly guide dynamic budget allocation. Our approach consists of two stages. The intra-image stage allocates each image a content-aware token budget and greedily selects its most representative tokens. The inter-image stage performs global diversity filtering to form a candidate pool and then applies a Pareto selection procedure that balances diversity with text alignment. Extensive experiments show that our approach maintains strong performance in long context settings while significantly cutting down the number of visual tokens.

Motivation: Existing token merging/pruning methods for Vision Transformers often ignore spatial continuity and neighbor relationships, causing loss of local context that limits computational efficiency.

Method: Proposes neighbor-aware token reduction using Hilbert curve reordering to preserve 2D spatial structure in 1D sequences. Two key strategies: Neighbor-Aware Pruning (NAP) for selective token retention and Merging by Adjacent Token similarity (MAT) for local token aggregation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantics and dynamics understanding is crucial for embodied agents, but existing data has redundancy. Need to efficiently select informative views from multi-camera setups rather than using all data.

Method: Formulate view selection as active learning problem. Use Fisher Information to quantify informativeness of candidate views for both semantic Gaussian parameters and deformation networks. Jointly handles semantic reasoning and dynamic scene modeling.

Result: Method consistently improves rendering quality and semantic segmentation performance on large-scale static images and dynamic video datasets. Outperforms baseline methods based on random selection and uncertainty-based heuristics.

Conclusion: Proposed active learning approach with Fisher Information provides principled alternative to heuristic strategies for view selection, enabling more efficient training of embodied agents for semantic and dynamic scene understanding.

Abstract: Understanding semantics and dynamics has been crucial for embodied agents in various tasks. Both tasks have much more data redundancy than the static scene understanding task. We formulate the view selection problem as an active learning problem, where the goal is to prioritize frames that provide the greatest information gain for model training. To this end, we propose an active learning algorithm with Fisher Information that quantifies the informativeness of candidate views with respect to both semantic Gaussian parameters and deformation networks. This formulation allows our method to jointly handle semantic reasoning and dynamic scene modeling, providing a principled alternative to heuristic or random strategies. We evaluate our method on large-scale static images and dynamic video datasets by selecting informative frames from multi-camera setups. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently improves rendering quality and semantic segmentation performance, outperforming baseline methods based on random selection and uncertainty-based heuristics.

TL;DR: Proposes Arithmetic GRM-based Quality Grading (AGQG) module to address semantic drift in AGIQA models by modeling quality assessment as a graded response problem with monotonic difficulty levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AGIQA models suffer from "semantic drift" where image embeddings show inconsistent similarities to multi-grade quality descriptions, undermining reliability of text-image shared-space learning.

Method: Inspired by psychometric Graded Response Model (GRM), designs two-branch quality grading module: one estimates image ability, the other constructs multiple difficulty levels with arithmetic modeling to ensure monotonicity and unimodal distribution.

Result: AGQG module shows plug-and-play advantage, consistently improves performance when integrated into various state-of-the-art AGIQA frameworks, and generalizes effectively to both natural and screen content image quality assessment.

Conclusion: The proposed AGQG module addresses semantic drift in AGIQA, provides interpretable quality distributions, and has potential as a key component in future IQA models due to its generalization capability.

Abstract: Existing AGIQA models typically estimate image quality by measuring and aggregating the similarities between image embeddings and text embeddings derived from multi-grade quality descriptions. Although effective, we observe that such similarity distributions across grades usually exhibit multimodal patterns. For instance, an image embedding may show high similarity to both "excellent" and "poor" grade descriptions while deviating from the "good" one. We refer to this phenomenon as "semantic drift", where semantic inconsistencies between text embeddings and their intended descriptions undermine the reliability of text-image shared-space learning. To mitigate this issue, we draw inspiration from psychometrics and propose an improved Graded Response Model (GRM) for AGIQA. The GRM is a classical assessment model that categorizes a subject's ability across grades using test items with various difficulty levels. This paradigm aligns remarkably well with human quality rating, where image quality can be interpreted as an image's ability to meet various quality grades. Building on this philosophy, we design a two-branch quality grading module: one branch estimates image ability while the other constructs multiple difficulty levels. To ensure monotonicity in difficulty levels, we further model difficulty generation in an arithmetic manner, which inherently enforces a unimodal and interpretable quality distribution. Our Arithmetic GRM based Quality Grading (AGQG) module enjoys a plug-and-play advantage, consistently improving performance when integrated into various state-of-the-art AGIQA frameworks. Moreover, it also generalizes effectively to both natural and screen content image quality assessment, revealing its potential as a key component in future IQA models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EPD-Solver: A novel ODE solver for diffusion models that uses parallel gradient evaluations to reduce truncation errors while maintaining low latency through full parallelization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have high sampling latency due to sequential denoising, and existing acceleration methods suffer from image quality degradation under low-latency budgets due to accumulated truncation errors from missing high-curvature trajectory segments.

Method: EPD-Solver incorporates multiple parallel gradient evaluations per step using Mean Value Theorem for vector-valued functions, with a two-stage optimization: distillation-based parameter learning followed by parameter-efficient RL fine-tuning (stochastic Dirichlet policy) that operates only in solver space.

Result: The method reduces truncation errors while preserving low-latency sampling through full parallelization of gradient computations, and can serve as a plugin to improve existing ODE samplers.

Conclusion: EPD-Solver effectively mitigates quality degradation in accelerated diffusion model sampling by leveraging parallel gradient evaluations and geometric insights about trajectory manifolds, with RL fine-tuning that avoids reward hacking by staying in low-dimensional solver space.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved state-of-the-art generative performance but suffer from high sampling latency due to their sequential denoising nature. Existing solver-based acceleration methods often face significant image quality degradation under a low-latency budget, primarily due to accumulated truncation errors arising from the inability to capture high-curvature trajectory segments. In this paper, we propose the Ensemble Parallel Direction solver (dubbed as EPD-Solver), a novel ODE solver that mitigates these errors by incorporating multiple parallel gradient evaluations in each step. Motivated by the geometric insight that sampling trajectories are largely confined to a low-dimensional manifold, EPD-Solver leverages the Mean Value Theorem for vector-valued functions to approximate the integral solution more accurately. Importantly, since the additional gradient computations are independent, they can be fully parallelized, preserving low-latency sampling nature. We introduce a two-stage optimization framework. Initially, EPD-Solver optimizes a small set of learnable parameters via a distillation-based approach. We further propose a parameter-efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL) fine-tuning scheme that reformulates the solver as a stochastic Dirichlet policy. Unlike traditional methods that fine-tune the massive backbone, our RL approach operates strictly within the low-dimensional solver space, effectively mitigating reward hacking while enhancing performance in complex text-to-image (T2I) generation tasks. In addition, our method is flexible and can serve as a plugin (EPD-Plugin) to improve existing ODE samplers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language tracking methods are limited to local search, making them prone to failures under viewpoint changes, occlusions, and rapid target movements. There's a need for more robust tracking that can locate targets across the entire image space.

Method: Proposes VPTracker, a global tracking framework using Multimodal Large Language Models with location-aware visual prompting. The method constructs region-level prompts based on the target's previous location, enabling the model to prioritize region-level recognition and resort to global inference only when necessary.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach significantly enhances tracking stability and target disambiguation under challenging scenarios, effectively suppressing interference from distracting visual content while maintaining global tracking advantages.

Conclusion: The work opens a new avenue for integrating MLLMs into visual tracking by combining global search robustness with effective distraction suppression through location-aware prompting mechanisms.

Abstract: Vision-Language Tracking aims to continuously localize objects described by a visual template and a language description. Existing methods, however, are typically limited to local search, making them prone to failures under viewpoint changes, occlusions, and rapid target movements. In this work, we introduce the first global tracking framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (VPTracker), exploiting their powerful semantic reasoning to locate targets across the entire image space. While global search improves robustness and reduces drift, it also introduces distractions from visually or semantically similar objects. To address this, we propose a location-aware visual prompting mechanism that incorporates spatial priors into the MLLM. Specifically, we construct a region-level prompt based on the target's previous location, enabling the model to prioritize region-level recognition and resort to global inference only when necessary. This design retains the advantages of global tracking while effectively suppressing interference from distracting visual content. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly enhances tracking stability and target disambiguation under challenging scenarios, opening a new avenue for integrating MLLMs into visual tracking.

Traditional methods are computationally expensive and prone to structural discontinuities and loss of detail in sparse slices, making it difficult to meet clinical accuracy requirements.To address these challenges, we propose an efficient 3D reconstruction method based on 3D Gaussian and tri-plane representations. This method not only maintains the advantages of Gaussian representation in efficient rendering and geometric representation but also significantly enhances structural continuity and semantic consistency under sparse slicing conditions. Experimental results on multimodal medical datasets such as US and MRI show that our proposed method can generate high-quality, anatomically coherent, and semantically stable medical images under sparse data conditions, while significantly improving reconstruction efficiency. This provides an efficient and reliable new approach for 3D visualization and clinical analysis of medical images.

*Po-Chih Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Evaluates open-vocabulary object detection models on low-quality images using a new dataset, finding performance drops under high-level degradation with OWLv2 showing best robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-vocabulary object detection aims for human-like recognition capabilities, but existing models need evaluation under real-world low-quality image conditions that commonly occur in practical applications.

Method: Created a new dataset simulating real-world low-quality images and evaluated multiple open-vocabulary object detection models (OWLv2, OWL-ViT, GroundingDINO, Detic) under varying levels of image degradation.

Result: Models showed no significant mAP decrease under low-level degradation, but all dropped sharply under high-level degradation. OWLv2 consistently performed best across degradation types, while OWL-ViT, GroundingDINO, and Detic showed significant performance declines.

Conclusion: Open-vocabulary object detection models need improvement for robustness to high-level image degradation. The new dataset and released codes will support future research in this area.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection enables models to localize and recognize objects beyond a predefined set of categories and is expected to achieve recognition capabilities comparable to human performance. In this study, we aim to evaluate the performance of existing models on open-vocabulary object detection tasks under low-quality image conditions. For this purpose, we introduce a new dataset that simulates low-quality images in the real world. In our evaluation experiment, we find that although open-vocabulary object detection models exhibited no significant decrease in mAP scores under low-level image degradation, the performance of all models dropped sharply under high-level image degradation. OWLv2 models consistently performed better across different types of degradation, while OWL-ViT, GroundingDINO, and Detic showed significant performance declines. We will release our dataset and codes to facilitate future studies.

TL;DR: EgoReAct: First autoregressive framework generating 3D-aligned human reaction motions from egocentric video in real-time with strict causality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to model human reactions from egocentric video due to requirements for causal generation and precise 3D spatial alignment. Current datasets like ViMo have spatial inconsistencies between video and reaction motion.

Method: Created Human Reaction Dataset (HRD) for spatial alignment. EgoReAct framework uses Vector Quantised-VAE to compress motion into latent space, then trains Generative Pre-trained Transformer for reaction generation. Incorporates 3D dynamic features (metric depth, head dynamics) for spatial grounding.

Result: EgoReAct achieves higher realism, spatial consistency, and generation efficiency than prior methods while maintaining strict causality. Enables real-time generation of 3D-aligned human reactions from egocentric video streams.

Conclusion: EgoReAct successfully addresses the challenge of generating spatially aligned, causal human reactions from egocentric video, with plans to release code, models, and data upon acceptance.

Abstract: Humans exhibit adaptive, context-sensitive responses to egocentric visual input. However, faithfully modeling such reactions from egocentric video remains challenging due to the dual requirements of strictly causal generation and precise 3D spatial alignment. To tackle this problem, we first construct the Human Reaction Dataset (HRD) to address data scarcity and misalignment by building a spatially aligned egocentric video-reaction dataset, as existing datasets (e.g., ViMo) suffer from significant spatial inconsistency between the egocentric video and reaction motion, e.g., dynamically moving motions are always paired with fixed-camera videos. Leveraging HRD, we present EgoReAct, the first autoregressive framework that generates 3D-aligned human reaction motions from egocentric video streams in real-time. We first compress the reaction motion into a compact yet expressive latent space via a Vector Quantised-Variational AutoEncoder and then train a Generative Pre-trained Transformer for reaction generation from the visual input. EgoReAct incorporates 3D dynamic features, i.e., metric depth, and head dynamics during the generation, which effectively enhance spatial grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EgoReAct achieves remarkably higher realism, spatial consistency, and generation efficiency compared with prior methods, while maintaining strict causality during generation. We will release code, models, and data upon acceptance.

*Hualie Jiang,Ziyang Song,Zhiqiang Lou,Rui Xu,Minglang Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DA360 adapts Depth Anything V2 for panoramic depth estimation, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance through shift parameter learning and circular padding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Panoramic depth estimation has strong applications in robotics and AR/VR, but its zero-shot generalization to open-world domains lags behind perspective images due to limited training data. The paper aims to bridge this gap by transferring capabilities from the perspective domain.

Method: DA360 adapts Depth Anything V2 for panoramic images by learning a shift parameter from the ViT backbone to transform scale-and-shift-invariant output into scale-invariant depth estimates. It also integrates circular padding into the DPT decoder to eliminate seam artifacts and ensure spherical continuity.

Result: DA360 achieves over 50% and 10% relative depth error reduction on indoor and outdoor benchmarks respectively compared to its base model. It outperforms robust panoramic depth estimation methods by about 30% relative error improvement compared to PanDA across all three test datasets, establishing new state-of-the-art for zero-shot panoramic depth estimation.

Conclusion: The proposed DA360 successfully bridges the gap between perspective and panoramic depth estimation, demonstrating strong zero-shot generalization capabilities through innovative architectural adaptations and establishing new state-of-the-art performance in panoramic depth estimation.

Abstract: Panoramic depth estimation provides a comprehensive solution for capturing complete $360^\circ$ environmental structural information, offering significant benefits for robotics and AR/VR applications. However, while extensively studied in indoor settings, its zero-shot generalization to open-world domains lags far behind perspective images, which benefit from abundant training data. This disparity makes transferring capabilities from the perspective domain an attractive solution. To bridge this gap, we present Depth Anything in $360^\circ$ (DA360), a panoramic-adapted version of Depth Anything V2. Our key innovation involves learning a shift parameter from the ViT backbone, transforming the model's scale- and shift-invariant output into a scale-invariant estimate that directly yields well-formed 3D point clouds. This is complemented by integrating circular padding into the DPT decoder to eliminate seam artifacts, ensuring spatially coherent depth maps that respect spherical continuity. Evaluated on standard indoor benchmarks and our newly curated outdoor dataset, Metropolis, DA360 shows substantial gains over its base model, achieving over 50\% and 10\% relative depth error reduction on indoor and outdoor benchmarks, respectively. Furthermore, DA360 significantly outperforms robust panoramic depth estimation methods, achieving about 30\% relative error improvement compared to PanDA across all three test datasets and establishing new state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot panoramic depth estimation.

TL;DR: Proposes KANO, a novel interpretable neural operator based on Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem for image super-resolution, using B-spline functions to transparently model degradation processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing interpretable SR methods rely on black-box deep networks that leave degradation processes unknown and uncontrollable. Need for transparent, structured representations of latent degradation fitting processes.

Method: Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Operator (KANO) uses additive structure of finite B-spline functions to approximate continuous spectral curves piecewise. Learns shape parameters of spline functions to capture key spectral characteristics like local linear trends and peak-valley structures at nonlinear inflection points.

Result: KANO accurately captures spectral characteristics and endows SR results with physical interpretability. Comparative study shows advantages and limitations of MLPs vs KANs in handling complex sequence fitting tasks and characterizing degradation mechanisms.

Conclusion: KANO provides transparent, structured representation of degradation processes for interpretable SR, offering valuable insights for developing interpretable SR techniques through systematic comparison of different neural architectures.

Abstract: The highly nonlinear degradation process, complex physical interactions, and various sources of uncertainty render single-image Super-resolution (SR) a particularly challenging task. Existing interpretable SR approaches, whether based on prior learning or deep unfolding optimization frameworks, typically rely on black-box deep networks to model latent variables, which leaves the degradation process largely unknown and uncontrollable. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem (KAT), we for the first time propose a novel interpretable operator, termed Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Operator (KANO), with the application to image SR. KANO provides a transparent and structured representation of the latent degradation fitting process. Specifically, we employ an additive structure composed of a finite number of B-spline functions to approximate continuous spectral curves in a piecewise fashion. By learning and optimizing the shape parameters of these spline functions within defined intervals, our KANO accurately captures key spectral characteristics, such as local linear trends and the peak-valley structures at nonlinear inflection points, thereby endowing SR results with physical interpretability. Furthermore, through theoretical modeling and experimental evaluations across natural images, aerial photographs, and satellite remote sensing data, we systematically compare multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) in handling complex sequence fitting tasks. This comparative study elucidates the respective advantages and limitations of these models in characterizing intricate degradation mechanisms, offering valuable insights for the development of interpretable SR techniques.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D segmentation frameworks rely solely on visual learning from annotated datasets, limiting adaptability to new domains and clinical tasks. They lack semantic understanding to address flexible, user-defined segmentation objectives.

Method: Proposes SwinTF3D with a transformer-based visual encoder for volumetric features and a compact text encoder, integrated via an efficient fusion mechanism to align semantic cues with spatial structures in medical volumes.

Result: Extensive experiments on BTCV dataset show competitive Dice and IoU scores across multiple organs, good generalization to unseen data, and significant efficiency gains compared to conventional transformer-based segmentation networks.

Conclusion: SwinTF3D establishes a practical and interpretable paradigm for interactive, text-driven 3D medical image segmentation, opening perspectives for more adaptive and resource-efficient solutions in clinical imaging by bridging visual perception with linguistic understanding.

Abstract: The recent integration of artificial intelligence into medical imaging has driven remarkable advances in automated organ segmentation. However, most existing 3D segmentation frameworks rely exclusively on visual learning from large annotated datasets restricting their adaptability to new domains and clinical tasks. The lack of semantic understanding in these models makes them ineffective in addressing flexible, user-defined segmentation objectives. To overcome these limitations, we propose SwinTF3D, a lightweight multimodal fusion approach that unifies visual and linguistic representations for text-guided 3D medical image segmentation. The model employs a transformer-based visual encoder to extract volumetric features and integrates them with a compact text encoder via an efficient fusion mechanism. This design allows the system to understand natural-language prompts and correctly align semantic cues with their corresponding spatial structures in medical volumes, while producing accurate, context-aware segmentation results with low computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the BTCV dataset demonstrate that SwinTF3D achieves competitive Dice and IoU scores across multiple organs, despite its compact architecture. The model generalizes well to unseen data and offers significant efficiency gains compared to conventional transformer-based segmentation networks. Bridging visual perception with linguistic understanding, SwinTF3D establishes a practical and interpretable paradigm for interactive, text-driven 3D medical image segmentation, opening perspectives for more adaptive and resource-efficient solutions in clinical imaging.

Motivation: Existing 3D change detection methods suffer from spatial inconsistency in detected changes and fail to explicitly separate pre- and post-change states, limiting their effectiveness in scene monitoring and continual reconstruction applications.

Method: The approach uses a signed-distance-based 2D differencing module followed by multi-view aggregation with voting and pruning, leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) consistency to robustly separate pre- and post-change states. It also includes a continual scene reconstruction strategy that selectively updates dynamic regions while preserving unchanged areas.

Conclusion: SCaR-3D effectively addresses limitations of existing 3D change detection methods by providing spatially consistent change detection with explicit separation of pre- and post-change states, enabling better scene monitoring and continual reconstruction.

Abstract: Change detection plays a vital role in scene monitoring, exploration, and continual reconstruction. Existing 3D change detection methods often exhibit spatial inconsistency in the detected changes and fail to explicitly separate pre- and post-change states. To address these limitations, we propose SCaR-3D, a novel 3D scene change detection framework that identifies object-level changes from a dense-view pre-change image sequence and sparse-view post-change images. Our approach consists of a signed-distance-based 2D differencing module followed by multi-view aggregation with voting and pruning, leveraging the consistent nature of 3DGS to robustly separate pre- and post-change states. We further develop a continual scene reconstruction strategy that selectively updates dynamic regions while preserving the unchanged areas. We also contribute CCS3D, a challenging synthetic dataset that allows flexible combinations of 3D change types to support controlled evaluations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D visual grounding methods rely on pre-defined Object Lookup Tables (OLTs) to query VLMs, which limits applications in scenarios with undefined or unforeseen targets, preventing open-world generalization.

Method: Proposes OpenGround with Active Cognition-based Reasoning (ACR) module that progressively augments VLM cognitive scope through human-like perception via cognitive task chains, actively reasoning about contextually relevant objects with dynamically updated OLTs.

Conclusion: OpenGround enables zero-shot open-world 3D visual grounding by overcoming OLT limitations through active cognition-based reasoning, demonstrating strong performance across both pre-defined and open-world scenarios.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding aims to locate objects based on natural language descriptions in 3D scenes. Existing methods rely on a pre-defined Object Lookup Table (OLT) to query Visual Language Models (VLMs) for reasoning about object locations, which limits the applications in scenarios with undefined or unforeseen targets. To address this problem, we present OpenGround, a novel zero-shot framework for open-world 3D visual grounding. Central to OpenGround is the Active Cognition-based Reasoning (ACR) module, which is designed to overcome the fundamental limitation of pre-defined OLTs by progressively augmenting the cognitive scope of VLMs. The ACR module performs human-like perception of the target via a cognitive task chain and actively reasons about contextually relevant objects, thereby extending VLM cognition through a dynamically updated OLT. This allows OpenGround to function with both pre-defined and open-world categories. We also propose a new dataset named OpenTarget, which contains over 7000 object-description pairs to evaluate our method in open-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OpenGround achieves competitive performance on Nr3D, state-of-the-art on ScanRefer, and delivers a substantial 17.6% improvement on OpenTarget.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Estimating relative pose and focal length from two affine correspondences when vertical direction is known from IMU data, reducing DOF from 5 to 3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cameras combined with IMUs are common in applications like self-driving cars, smartphones, and drones. IMUs provide vertical direction, reducing relative pose estimation complexity from 5DOF to 3DOF.

Method: 1) Establish constraint equations from two affine correspondences with known vertical direction. 2) Derive four equations involving only focal length and relative rotation angle. 3) Use polynomial eigenvalue method to solve for focal length and rotation angle.

Result: The proposed solver outperforms existing state-of-the-art solvers on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: A novel solver for estimating 3DOF relative pose and focal length from two affine correspondences with known vertical direction is effective and superior to existing methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to estimate the relative pose and focal length between two views with known intrinsic parameters except for an unknown focal length from two affine correspondences (ACs). Cameras are commonly used in combination with inertial measurement units (IMUs) in applications such as self-driving cars, smartphones, and unmanned aerial vehicles. The vertical direction of camera views can be obtained by IMU measurements. The relative pose between two cameras is reduced from 5DOF to 3DOF. We propose a new solver to estimate the 3DOF relative pose and focal length. First, we establish constraint equations from two affine correspondences when the vertical direction is known. Then, based on the properties of the equation system with nontrivial solutions, four equations can be derived. These four equations only involve two parameters: the focal length and the relative rotation angle. Finally, the polynomial eigenvalue method is utilized to solve the problem of focal length and relative rotation angle. The proposed solver is evaluated using synthetic and real-world datasets. The results show that our solver performs better than the existing state-of-the-art solvers.

TL;DR: Architecture analysis of two VLMs (Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E-Instruct) mapping to a video-to-artifact pipeline for person detection with emotion attributes, highlighting system constraints and practical implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how architectural properties of modern vision-language models translate to practical video analysis pipelines, specifically for person detection with emotion attributes, and to identify critical system constraints for robust implementation.

Method: Architecture-led analysis of two VLMs, connecting their multimodal foundations (visual tokenization, Transformer attention, instruction following) to a video processing pipeline that samples frames, prompts VLMs for person detection with bounding boxes and attributes, validates output structure, and optionally renders annotated videos.

Result: Identified key system constraints: structured outputs can be syntactically valid but semantically incorrect, schema validation is structural (not geometric), person identifiers are frame-local, and interactive analysis returns free-form text rather than schema-enforced JSON.

Conclusion: Understanding the mapping between VLM architecture and practical pipeline constraints is critical for writing defensible claims, designing robust interfaces, and planning proper evaluation of video analysis systems.

Abstract: This report provides an architecture-led analysis of two modern vision-language models (VLMs), Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E-Instruct, and explains how their architectural properties map to a practical video-to-artifact pipeline implemented in the BodyLanguageDetection repository [1]. The system samples video frames, prompts a VLM to detect visible people and generate pixel-space bounding boxes with prompt-conditioned attributes (emotion by default), validates output structure using a predefined schema, and optionally renders an annotated video. We first summarize the shared multimodal foundation (visual tokenization, Transformer attention, and instruction following), then describe each architecture at a level sufficient to justify engineering choices without speculative internals. Finally, we connect model behavior to system constraints: structured outputs can be syntactically valid while semantically incorrect, schema validation is structural (not geometric correctness), person identifiers are frame-local in the current prompting contract, and interactive single-frame analysis returns free-form text rather than schema-enforced JSON. These distinctions are critical for writing defensible claims, designing robust interfaces, and planning evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HOI video generation methods have two critical limitations: (1) lack of effective mechanisms to inject multi-view object information, leading to poor cross-view consistency, and (2) heavy reliance on fine-grained hand mesh annotations for modeling interaction occlusions.

Method: ByteLoom uses a Diffusion Transformer framework with an RCM-cache mechanism that leverages Relative Coordinate Maps as a universal representation to maintain object geometry consistency and control 6-DoF object transformations. It also employs a progressive training curriculum to compensate for HOI dataset scarcity and reduce reliance on hand mesh annotations.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the method faithfully preserves human identity and object's multi-view geometry while maintaining smooth motion and object manipulation.

Conclusion: ByteLoom addresses key limitations in HOI video generation by providing geometrically consistent object illustration with simplified conditioning, reducing dependency on hand mesh annotations through progressive training.

Abstract: Human-object interaction (HOI) video generation has garnered increasing attention due to its promising applications in digital humans, e-commerce, advertising, and robotics imitation learning. However, existing methods face two critical limitations: (1) a lack of effective mechanisms to inject multi-view information of the object into the model, leading to poor cross-view consistency, and (2) heavy reliance on fine-grained hand mesh annotations for modeling interaction occlusions. To address these challenges, we introduce ByteLoom, a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework that generates realistic HOI videos with geometrically consistent object illustration, using simplified human conditioning and 3D object inputs. We first propose an RCM-cache mechanism that leverages Relative Coordinate Maps (RCM) as a universal representation to maintain object's geometry consistency and precisely control 6-DoF object transformations in the meantime. To compensate HOI dataset scarcity and leverage existing datasets, we further design a training curriculum that enhances model capabilities in a progressive style and relaxes the demand of hand mesh. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method faithfully preserves human identity and the object's multi-view geometry, while maintaining smooth motion and object manipulation.

TL;DR: Segmentation-guided CXR classification using MedSAM for lung extraction improves normal case screening but shows trade-offs with abnormality-specific classification, with effects being task- and architecture-dependent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated CXR interpretation faces challenges from weak disease signals, dataset bias, and limited spatial supervision. Foundation models like MedSAM offer anatomically grounded priors that could improve robustness and interpretability in CXR analysis.

Method: Proposed segmentation-guided CXR classification pipeline integrating MedSAM for lung region extraction, fine-tuned on public image-mask data, then applied to NIH CXR dataset for multi-label prediction of five abnormalities using deep CNNs with different masking strategies (original, loose, tight).

Result: MedSAM produces anatomically plausible lung masks across diverse conditions. ResNet50 on original images achieves strongest abnormality discrimination, while loose masking yields comparable macro AUROC but significantly improves No Finding discrimination. Tight masking reduces abnormality performance but improves training efficiency.

Conclusion: Lung masking should be treated as a controllable spatial prior selected to match the backbone and clinical objective rather than applied uniformly, with trade-offs between abnormality-specific classification and normal case screening.

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is widely used for screening and diagnosing pulmonary abnormalities, yet automated interpretation remains challenging due to weak disease signals, dataset bias, and limited spatial supervision. Foundation models for medical image segmentation (MedSAM) provide an opportunity to introduce anatomically grounded priors that may improve robustness and interpretability in CXR analysis. We propose a segmentation-guided CXR classification pipeline that integrates MedSAM as a lung region extraction module prior to multi-label abnormality classification. MedSAM is fine-tuned using a public image-mask dataset from Airlangga University Hospital. We then apply it to a curated subset of the public NIH CXR dataset to train and evaluate deep convolutional neural networks for multi-label prediction of five abnormalities (Mass, Nodule, Pneumonia, Edema, and Fibrosis), with the normal case (No Finding) evaluated via a derived score. Experiments show that MedSAM produces anatomically plausible lung masks across diverse imaging conditions. We find that masking effects are both task-dependent and architecture-dependent. ResNet50 trained on original images achieves the strongest overall abnormality discrimination, while loose lung masking yields comparable macro AUROC but significantly improves No Finding discrimination, indicating a trade-off between abnormality-specific classification and normal case screening. Tight masking consistently reduces abnormality level performance but improves training efficiency. Loose masking partially mitigates this degradation by preserving perihilar and peripheral context. These results suggest that lung masking should be treated as a controllable spatial prior selected to match the backbone and clinical objective, rather than applied uniformly.

TL;DR: PathoSyn is a unified generative framework for MRI synthesis that disentangles anatomical structure from pathological deviations using a deviation-space diffusion model to generate high-fidelity synthetic medical images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models for MRI synthesis suffer from feature entanglement when operating in pixel domains or using binary masks, leading to corrupted anatomical substrates and structural discontinuities. There's a need for a principled approach that preserves anatomical integrity while modeling pathological variations.

Method: Decomposes synthesis into deterministic anatomical reconstruction and stochastic deviation modeling. Uses a Deviation-Space Diffusion Model to learn conditional distributions of pathological residuals, coupled with seam-aware fusion and inference-time stabilization modules to ensure spatial coherence and suppress boundary artifacts.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on tumor imaging benchmarks show PathoSyn significantly outperforms holistic diffusion and mask-conditioned baselines in both perceptual realism and anatomical fidelity.

Conclusion: PathoSyn provides a mathematically principled pipeline for generating high-fidelity patient-specific synthetic datasets, enabling robust diagnostic algorithm development in low-data regimes, interpretable counterfactual disease progression modeling, and precision intervention planning.

Abstract: We present PathoSyn, a unified generative framework for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) image synthesis that reformulates imaging-pathology as a disentangled additive deviation on a stable anatomical manifold. Current generative models typically operate in the global pixel domain or rely on binary masks, these paradigms often suffer from feature entanglement, leading to corrupted anatomical substrates or structural discontinuities. PathoSyn addresses these limitations by decomposing the synthesis task into deterministic anatomical reconstruction and stochastic deviation modeling. Central to our framework is a Deviation-Space Diffusion Model designed to learn the conditional distribution of pathological residuals, thereby capturing localized intensity variations while preserving global structural integrity by construction. To ensure spatial coherence, the diffusion process is coupled with a seam-aware fusion strategy and an inference-time stabilization module, which collectively suppress boundary artifacts and produce high-fidelity internal lesion heterogeneity. PathoSyn provides a mathematically principled pipeline for generating high-fidelity patient-specific synthetic datasets, facilitating the development of robust diagnostic algorithms in low-data regimes. By allowing interpretable counterfactual disease progression modeling, the framework supports precision intervention planning and provides a controlled environment for benchmarking clinical decision-support systems. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on tumor imaging benchmarks demonstrate that PathoSyn significantly outperforms holistic diffusion and mask-conditioned baselines in both perceptual realism and anatomical fidelity. The source code of this work will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSL methods in medical imaging overlook the fundamental anatomical structure of human body, which is the key foundation in medical images, limiting their ability to learn meaningful anatomical features.

Method: Built Lamps framework that pre-trains on large-scale chest radiographs using consistency, coherence, and hierarchy of human anatomy as supervision signals through self-supervised learning.

Result: Extensive experiments across 10 datasets show Lamps outperforms 10 baseline models in robustness, transferability, and clinical potential through fine-tuning and emergent property analysis.

Conclusion: Lamps enables foundation models to develop meaningful, robust representations aligned with human anatomy structure by learning from multiple anatomical perspectives.

Abstract: Foundation models have been successful in natural language processing and computer vision because they are capable of capturing the underlying structures (foundation) of natural languages. However, in medical imaging, the key foundation lies in human anatomy, as these images directly represent the internal structures of the body, reflecting the consistency, coherence, and hierarchy of human anatomy. Yet, existing self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often overlook these perspectives, limiting their ability to effectively learn anatomical features. To overcome the limitation, we built Lamps (learning anatomy from multiple perspectives via self-supervision) pre-trained on large-scale chest radiographs by harmoniously utilizing the consistency, coherence, and hierarchy of human anatomy as the supervision signal. Extensive experiments across 10 datasets evaluated through fine-tuning and emergent property analysis demonstrate Lamps' superior robustness, transferability, and clinical potential when compared to 10 baseline models. By learning from multiple perspectives, Lamps presents a unique opportunity for foundation models to develop meaningful, robust representations that are aligned with the structure of human anatomy.

Abstract: This research proposes "ForCM", a novel approach to forest cover mapping that combines Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) with Deep Learning (DL) using multispectral Sentinel-2 imagery. The study explores several DL models, including UNet, UNet++, ResUNet, AttentionUNet, and ResNet50-Segnet, applied to high-resolution Sentinel-2 Level 2A satellite images of the Amazon Rainforest. The datasets comprise three collections: two sets of three-band imagery and one set of four-band imagery. After evaluation, the most effective DL models are individually integrated with the OBIA technique to enhance mapping accuracy. The originality of this work lies in evaluating different deep learning models combined with OBIA and comparing them with traditional OBIA methods. The results show that the proposed ForCM method improves forest cover mapping, achieving overall accuracies of 94.54 percent with ResUNet-OBIA and 95.64 percent with AttentionUNet-OBIA, compared to 92.91 percent using traditional OBIA. This research also demonstrates the potential of free and user-friendly tools such as QGIS for accurate mapping within their limitations, supporting global environmental monitoring and conservation efforts.

*Weiwei Li,Junzhuo Liu,Yuanyuan Ren,Yuchen Zheng,Yahao Liu,Wen Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes NSF debiasing pipeline to mitigate spurious correlations in deep learning by identifying, neutralizing, eliminating, and updating features without requiring spurious attribute annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for addressing spurious correlations require annotating spurious attributes or rely on empirical assumptions about bias simplicity, which may not capture the intricate nature of real-world spurious correlations.

Method: Four-step pipeline: 1) Identify spurious features by observing dispersed distribution patterns in feature space, 2) Obtain bias-invariant representation by neutralizing spurious features via grouping, 3) Learn feature transformation to eliminate spurious features by aligning with bias-invariant representation, 4) Update classifier with learned transformation.

Result: Achieves over 20% improvement in worst group accuracy compared to standard empirical risk minimization (ERM) on image and NLP debiasing benchmarks.

Conclusion: Proposes an effective data-oriented pipeline for mitigating spurious correlations without requiring spurious attribute annotations, demonstrating significant improvements in debiasing performance across multiple domains.

Abstract: Deep learning models are known to often learn features that spuriously correlate with the class label during training but are irrelevant to the prediction task. Existing methods typically address this issue by annotating potential spurious attributes, or filtering spurious features based on some empirical assumptions (e.g., simplicity of bias). However, these methods may yield unsatisfactory performance due to the intricate and elusive nature of spurious correlations in real-world data. In this paper, we propose a data-oriented approach to mitigate the spurious correlation in deep learning models. We observe that samples that are influenced by spurious features tend to exhibit a dispersed distribution in the learned feature space. This allows us to identify the presence of spurious features. Subsequently, we obtain a bias-invariant representation by neutralizing the spurious features based on a simple grouping strategy. Then, we learn a feature transformation to eliminate the spurious features by aligning with this bias-invariant representation. Finally, we update the classifier by incorporating the learned feature transformation and obtain an unbiased model. By integrating the aforementioned identifying, neutralizing, eliminating and updating procedures, we build an effective pipeline for mitigating spurious correlation. Experiments on image and NLP debiasing benchmarks show an improvement in worst group accuracy of more than 20% compared to standard empirical risk minimization (ERM).

*Jongoh Jeong,Youngjin Oh,Gyeongrae Nam,Jeongeun Lee,Kuk-Jin Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes using Unreal Engine to generate synthetic RGB data for military target detection, enabling cross-domain adaptation from synthetic to real military scenes where real data is scarce.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Military object detection faces challenges with mixed environments and limited real datasets. SAR data is robust but expensive, while RGB cameras are affordable but lack military-specific training data. Current domain adaptation methods focus on natural/autonomous driving scenes, not military domains.

Method: Generate synthetic RGB military target data using Unreal Engine, then conduct synthetic-to-real transfer experiments. Train on synthetic dataset and validate on web-collected real military target datasets. Benchmark state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods with varying supervision levels.

Result: Methods using minimal hints (e.g., object class) achieve substantial improvement over unsupervised or semi-supervised DA methods. Identifies current challenges that remain to be overcome in military domain adaptation.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generation using photorealistic tools like Unreal Engine offers a viable solution for military target detection where real data is limited. Current domain adaptation methods show promise but still face challenges in military cross-domain settings.

Abstract: Object detection is one of the key target tasks of interest in the context of civil and military applications. In particular, the real-world deployment of target detection methods is pivotal in the decision-making process during military command and reconnaissance. However, current domain adaptive object detection algorithms consider adapting one domain to another similar one only within the scope of natural or autonomous driving scenes. Since military domains often deal with a mixed variety of environments, detecting objects from multiple varying target domains poses a greater challenge. Several studies for armored military target detection have made use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data due to its robustness to all weather, long range, and high-resolution characteristics. Nevertheless, the costs of SAR data acquisition and processing are still much higher than those of the conventional RGB camera, which is a more affordable alternative with significantly lower data processing time. Furthermore, the lack of military target detection datasets limits the use of such a low-cost approach. To mitigate these issues, we propose to generate RGB-based synthetic data using a photorealistic visual tool, Unreal Engine, for military target detection in a cross-domain setting. To this end, we conducted synthetic-to-real transfer experiments by training our synthetic dataset and validating on our web-collected real military target datasets. We benchmark the state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods distinguished by the degree of supervision on our proposed train-val dataset pair, and find that current methods using minimal hints on the image (e.g., object class) achieve a substantial improvement over unsupervised or semi-supervised DA methods. From these observations, we recognize the current challenges that remain to be overcome.

*Ju-Hsuan Weng,Jia-Wei Liao,Cheng-Fu Chou,Jun-Cheng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M-ErasureBench is a multimodal evaluation framework for concept erasure methods, showing existing approaches fail against learned embeddings and inverted latents, while IRECE improves robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current concept erasure methods focus only on text prompts, ignoring other input modalities like learned embeddings and inverted latents that are increasingly used in real-world applications and can be exploited to bypass erasure defenses.

Method: Introduces M-ErasureBench framework with five evaluation scenarios across text prompts, learned embeddings, and inverted latents (with white-box/black-box access). Proposes IRECE module that localizes target concepts via cross-attention and perturbs associated latents during denoising.

Result: Existing methods achieve strong erasure against text prompts but fail under learned embeddings and inverted latents (CRR >90% in white-box). IRECE reduces CRR by up to 40% in challenging white-box latent inversion scenarios while preserving visual quality.

Conclusion: M-ErasureBench provides the first comprehensive benchmark for multimodal concept erasure, and IRECE offers practical safeguards for building more reliable protective generative models beyond text-only defenses.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models may generate harmful or copyrighted content, motivating research on concept erasure. However, existing approaches primarily focus on erasing concepts from text prompts, overlooking other input modalities that are increasingly critical in real-world applications such as image editing and personalized generation. These modalities can become attack surfaces, where erased concepts re-emerge despite defenses. To bridge this gap, we introduce M-ErasureBench, a novel multimodal evaluation framework that systematically benchmarks concept erasure methods across three input modalities: text prompts, learned embeddings, and inverted latents. For the latter two, we evaluate both white-box and black-box access, yielding five evaluation scenarios. Our analysis shows that existing methods achieve strong erasure performance against text prompts but largely fail under learned embeddings and inverted latents, with Concept Reproduction Rate (CRR) exceeding 90% in the white-box setting. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose IRECE (Inference-time Robustness Enhancement for Concept Erasure), a plug-and-play module that localizes target concepts via cross-attention and perturbs the associated latents during denoising. Experiments demonstrate that IRECE consistently restores robustness, reducing CRR by up to 40% under the most challenging white-box latent inversion scenario, while preserving visual quality. To the best of our knowledge, M-ErasureBench provides the first comprehensive benchmark of concept erasure beyond text prompts. Together with IRECE, our benchmark offers practical safeguards for building more reliable protective generative models.

*Youngchae Kwon,Jinyoung Choi,Injung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Holi-DETR: A holistic fashion item detection transformer that leverages three types of contextual information (co-occurrence, spatial arrangements, and body keypoints) to reduce ambiguities in fashion item detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fashion item detection is challenging due to diverse appearances and similarities among subcategories. Conventional detectors treat items independently, missing important contextual relationships that could help resolve ambiguities.

Method: Proposes Holi-DETR, a novel architecture based on Detection Transformer (DETR) that integrates three types of contextual information: (1) co-occurrence relationships between fashion items, (2) relative position and size based on inter-item spatial arrangements, and (3) spatial relationships between items and human body keypoints.

Result: The proposed method improved vanilla DETR by 3.6 percentage points (pp) and Co-DETR by 1.1 pp in terms of average precision (AP) for fashion item detection.

Conclusion: Holi-DETR demonstrates that holistic detection leveraging contextual information significantly improves fashion item detection performance by reducing ambiguities that arise from diverse appearances and similar subcategories.

Abstract: Fashion item detection is challenging due to the ambiguities introduced by the highly diverse appearances of fashion items and the similarities among item subcategories. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Holistic Detection Transformer (Holi-DETR) that detects fashion items in outfit images holistically, by leveraging contextual information. Fashion items often have meaningful relationships as they are combined to create specific styles. Unlike conventional detectors that detect each item independently, Holi-DETR detects multiple items while reducing ambiguities by leveraging three distinct types of contextual information: (1) the co-occurrence relationship between fashion items, (2) the relative position and size based on inter-item spatial arrangements, and (3) the spatial relationships between items and human body key-points. %Holi-DETR explicitly incorporates three types of contextual information: (1) the co-occurrence probability between fashion items, (2) the relative position and size based on inter-item spatial arrangements, and (3) the spatial relationships between items and human body key-points. To this end, we propose a novel architecture that integrates these three types of heterogeneous contextual information into the Detection Transformer (DETR) and its subsequent models. In experiments, the proposed methods improved the performance of the vanilla DETR and the more recently developed Co-DETR by 3.6 percent points (pp) and 1.1 pp, respectively, in terms of average precision (AP).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a framework using pre-trained text-guided image-to-image translation and image retrieval to efficiently generate realistic synthetic defect images for anomaly detection, with a two-stage training strategy to reduce costs while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised anomaly detection in industrial manufacturing faces challenges due to scarcity of real defect images. Existing synthesis methods present a trade-off: rule-based synthesis is cost-effective but unrealistic, while generative model-based synthesis is high-quality but expensive.

Method: Uses pre-trained text-guided image-to-image translation model to generate synthetic defect images, combined with image retrieval model to filter irrelevant outputs. Implements two-stage training: pre-training on large volume of rule-based synthetic images, then fine-tuning on smaller set of high-quality generated images.

Result: Experiments on MVTec AD dataset demonstrate effectiveness of the approach in improving anomaly detection performance while significantly reducing data collection costs.

Conclusion: The proposed framework efficiently generates realistic synthetic defect images and effectively leverages them through two-stage training, offering a practical solution to the data scarcity problem in industrial anomaly detection.

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a vital role in industrial manufacturing. Due to the scarcity of real defect images, unsupervised approaches that rely solely on normal images have been extensively studied. Recently, diffusion-based generative models brought attention to training data synthesis as an alternative solution. In this work, we focus on a strategy to effectively leverage synthetic images to maximize the anomaly detection performance. Previous synthesis strategies are broadly categorized into two groups, presenting a clear trade-off. Rule-based synthesis, such as injecting noise or pasting patches, is cost-effective but often fails to produce realistic defect images. On the other hand, generative model-based synthesis can create high-quality defect images but requires substantial cost. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework that leverages a pre-trained text-guided image-to-image translation model and image retrieval model to efficiently generate synthetic defect images. Specifically, the image retrieval model assesses the similarity of the generated images to real normal images and filters out irrelevant outputs, thereby enhancing the quality and relevance of the generated defect images. To effectively leverage synthetic images, we also introduce a two stage training strategy. In this strategy, the model is first pre-trained on a large volume of images from rule-based synthesis and then fine-tuned on a smaller set of high-quality images. This method significantly reduces the cost for data collection while improving the anomaly detection performance. Experiments on the MVTec AD dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPS replaces CFG's unstable extrapolation with manifold-constrained interpolation for stable iterative refinement in diffusion models, improving quality and prompt adherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) causes iterative refinement methods to fail by pushing sampling paths off the data manifold, leading to divergent approximation errors that undermine refinement quality.

Method: Proposes Guided Path Sampling (GPS) which replaces CFG's extrapolation with principled, manifold-constrained interpolation to keep sampling paths on the data manifold, plus an optimal scheduling strategy for dynamic guidance strength adjustment.

Result: GPS outperforms existing methods on SDXL and Hunyuan-DiT, achieving ImageReward 0.79, HPS v2 0.2995 on SDXL, and 57.45% semantic alignment accuracy on GenEval, with theoretical proof of bounded error amplification.

Conclusion: Path stability is essential for effective iterative refinement, and GPS provides a robust framework to achieve it through manifold-constrained interpolation instead of CFG's unstable extrapolation.

Abstract: Iterative refinement methods based on a denoising-inversion cycle are powerful tools for enhancing the quality and control of diffusion models. However, their effectiveness is critically limited when combined with standard Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). We identify a fundamental limitation: CFG's extrapolative nature systematically pushes the sampling path off the data manifold, causing the approximation error to diverge and undermining the refinement process. To address this, we propose Guided Path Sampling (GPS), a new paradigm for iterative refinement. GPS replaces unstable extrapolation with a principled, manifold-constrained interpolation, ensuring the sampling path remains on the data manifold. We theoretically prove that this correction transforms the error series from unbounded amplification to strictly bounded, guaranteeing stability. Furthermore, we devise an optimal scheduling strategy that dynamically adjusts guidance strength, aligning semantic injection with the model's natural coarse-to-fine generation process. Extensive experiments on modern backbones like SDXL and Hunyuan-DiT show that GPS outperforms existing methods in both perceptual quality and complex prompt adherence. For instance, GPS achieves a superior ImageReward of 0.79 and HPS v2 of 0.2995 on SDXL, while improving overall semantic alignment accuracy on GenEval to 57.45%. Our work establishes that path stability is a prerequisite for effective iterative refinement, and GPS provides a robust framework to achieve it.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PEG-DRNet is a physics-edge hybrid network for infrared gas leak detection that combines gas transport modeling with edge-aware feature routing to detect faint, small, semi-transparent plumes with weak boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared gas leak detection is challenging due to plumes being faint, small, semi-transparent, and having weak, diffuse boundaries, requiring specialized approaches to capture these subtle features.

Method: Three key components: 1) Gas Block with diffusion-convection modeling using local/large-kernel branches and edge-gated fusion; 2) AGPEO edge operator with multi-directional gradients and phase consistency; 3) CASR-PAN network with adaptive routing based on edge/content cues for selective feature propagation.

Result: Achieves 29.8% overall AP, 84.3% AP50, and 25.3% small-object AP on IIG dataset, outperforming RT-DETR-R18 by 3.0%, 6.5%, and 5.3% respectively, with only 43.7 Gflops and 14.9M parameters.

Conclusion: PEG-DRNet achieves superior performance with the best balance of accuracy and computational efficiency, outperforming existing CNN and Transformer detectors on IIG and LangGas datasets.

Abstract: Detecting infrared gas leaks is critical for environmental monitoring and industrial safety, yet remains difficult because plumes are faint, small, semitransparent, and have weak, diffuse boundaries. We present physics-edge hybrid gas dynamic routing network (PEG-DRNet). First, we introduce the Gas Block, a diffusion-convection unit modeling gas transport: a local branch captures short-range variations, while a large-kernel branch captures long-range propagation. An edge-gated learnable fusion module balances local detail and global context, strengthening weak-contrast plume and contour cues. Second, we propose the adaptive gradient and phase edge operator (AGPEO), computing reliable edge priors from multi-directional gradients and phase-consistent responses. These are transformed by a multi-scale edge perception module (MSEPM) into hierarchical edge features that reinforce boundaries. Finally, the content-adaptive sparse routing path aggregation network (CASR-PAN), with adaptive information modulation modules for fusion and self, selectively propagates informative features across scales based on edge and content cues, improving cross-scale discriminability while reducing redundancy. Experiments on the IIG dataset show that PEG-DRNet achieves an overall AP of 29.8\%, an AP$_{50}$ of 84.3\%, and a small-object AP of 25.3\%, surpassing the RT-DETR-R18 baseline by 3.0\%, 6.5\%, and 5.3\%, respectively, while requiring only 43.7 Gflops and 14.9 M parameters. The proposed PEG-DRNet achieves superior overall performance with the best balance of accuracy and computational efficiency, outperforming existing CNN and Transformer detectors in AP and AP$_{50}$ on the IIG and LangGas dataset.

TL;DR: Proposes hash grid feature pruning for Gaussian splatting compression by removing invalid features in sparse regions, reducing storage/transmission overhead without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hash grids in Gaussian splatting have many invalid features due to irregular/non-uniform distribution of Gaussian splats in 3D space, causing redundant storage and transmission overhead.

Method: Hash grid feature pruning method that identifies and prunes invalid features based on input Gaussian splat coordinates, encoding only valid features to reduce storage size.

Result: Achieves 8% average bitrate reduction compared to baseline while maintaining model performance, improving rate-distortion performance following Common Test Conditions (CTC).

Conclusion: The proposed pruning method effectively reduces hash grid storage requirements for Gaussian splatting compression without compromising quality, offering practical bitrate savings.

Abstract: Hash grids are widely used to learn an implicit neural field for Gaussian splatting, serving either as part of the entropy model or for inter-frame prediction. However, due to the irregular and non-uniform distribution of Gaussian splats in 3D space, numerous sparse regions exist, rendering many features in the hash grid invalid. This leads to redundant storage and transmission overhead. In this work, we propose a hash grid feature pruning method that identifies and prunes invalid features based on the coordinates of the input Gaussian splats, so that only the valid features are encoded. This approach reduces the storage size of the hash grid without compromising model performance, leading to improved rate-distortion performance. Following the Common Test Conditions (CTC) defined by the standardization committee, our method achieves an average bitrate reduction of 8% compared to the baseline approach.

TL;DR: ViLaCD-R1 is a two-stage VLM-based framework for remote sensing change detection that uses a Multi-Image Reasoner trained with SFT+RL for coarse change masks, then a Mask-Guided Decoder for precise binary change maps, achieving SOTA accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional pixel-based and encoder-decoder methods inadequately capture high-level semantics and are vulnerable to non-semantic perturbations. Recent multimodal/VLM approaches still suffer from inaccurate spatial localization, imprecise boundary delineation, and limited interpretability.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Multi-Image Reasoner (MIR) - VLM trained via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on block-level dual-temporal inference tasks, taking image patches as input to output coarse change masks; 2) Mask-Guided Decoder (MGD) - integrates dual-temporal image features with coarse mask to predict precise binary change maps.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on multiple RSCD benchmarks show ViLaCD-R1 substantially improves true semantic change recognition and localization, robustly suppresses non-semantic variations, and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in complex real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: ViLaCD-R1 effectively addresses limitations of existing RSCD methods by combining VLM-based semantic reasoning with precise mask-guided decoding, demonstrating superior performance in semantic change detection while handling non-semantic variations.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD), a complex multi-image inference task, traditionally uses pixel-based operators or encoder-decoder networks that inadequately capture high-level semantics and are vulnerable to non-semantic perturbations. Although recent multimodal and vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches enhance semantic understanding of change regions by incorporating textual descriptions, they still suffer from challenges such as inaccurate spatial localization, imprecise pixel-level boundary delineation, and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose ViLaCD-R1, a two-stage framework comprising a Multi-Image Reasoner (MIR) and a Mask-Guided Decoder (MGD). Specifically, the VLM is trained through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) on block-level dual-temporal inference tasks, taking dual-temporal image patches as input and outputting a coarse change mask. Then, the decoder integrates dual-temporal image features with this coarse mask to predict a precise binary change map. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple RSCD benchmarks demonstrate that ViLaCD-R1 substantially improves true semantic change recognition and localization, robustly suppresses non-semantic variations, and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in complex real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: JavisGPT successfully demonstrates unified joint audio-video comprehension and generation capabilities through its novel architecture and training approach, setting new standards for multimodal AI systems.

Abstract: This paper presents JavisGPT, the first unified multimodal large language model (MLLM) for Joint Audio-Video (JAV) comprehension and generation. JavisGPT adopts a concise encoder-LLM-decoder architecture, featuring a SyncFusion module for spatio-temporal audio-video fusion and synchrony-aware learnable queries to bridge a pretrained JAV-DiT generator. This design enables temporally coherent video-audio understanding and generation from multimodal instructions. We design an effective three-stage training pipeline consisting of multimodal pretraining, audio-video fine-tuning, and large-scale instruction-tuning, to progressively build multimodal comprehension and generation from existing vision-language models. To support this, we further construct JavisInst-Omni, a high-quality instruction dataset with over 200K GPT-4o-curated audio-video-text dialogues that span diverse and multi-level comprehension and generation scenarios. Extensive experiments on JAV comprehension and generation benchmarks show that JavisGPT outperforms existing MLLMs, particularly in complex and temporally synchronized settings.

Motivation: To compare specialized vs general multimodal LLMs for medical imaging diagnosis, assessing whether domain-specific fine-tuning provides superior clinical performance over proprietary general models.

Method: Comparative study between open-source MedGemma-4b-it (fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation) and proprietary GPT-4 for diagnosing six diseases; performance evaluated via accuracy, sensitivity, confusion matrices, and classification reports.

Result: MedGemma achieved significantly higher mean test accuracy (80.37% vs 69.58%), demonstrated superior sensitivity for high-stakes conditions (cancer, pneumonia), and showed better overall diagnostic capability with fewer hallucinations.

Conclusion: Domain-specific fine-tuning is crucial for reliable clinical implementation; MedGemma represents a sophisticated tool for evidence-based medical reasoning, outperforming general-purpose models in diagnostic accuracy and safety.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) introduce an emerging paradigm for medical imaging by interpreting scans through the lens of extensive clinical knowledge, offering a transformative approach to disease classification. This study presents a critical comparison between two fundamentally different AI architectures: the specialized open-source agent MedGemma and the proprietary large multimodal model GPT-4 for diagnosing six different diseases. The MedGemma-4b-it model, fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), demonstrated superior diagnostic capability by achieving a mean test accuracy of 80.37% compared to 69.58% for the untuned GPT-4. Furthermore, MedGemma exhibited notably higher sensitivity in high-stakes clinical tasks, such as cancer and pneumonia detection. Quantitative analysis via confusion matrices and classification reports provides comprehensive insights into model performance across all categories. These results emphasize that domain-specific fine-tuning is essential for minimizing hallucinations in clinical implementation, positioning MedGemma as a sophisticated tool for complex, evidence-based medical reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM-based autonomous driving planners face three key challenges: mismatch between discrete text reasoning and continuous control, high latency from autoregressive decoding, and inefficient/non-causal planners limiting real-time deployment.

Method: ColaVLA uses a Cognitive Latent Reasoner that compresses scene understanding into decision-oriented meta-action embeddings via ego-adaptive selection with only two VLM forward passes, coupled with a Hierarchical Parallel Planner that generates multi-scale, causality-consistent trajectories in a single forward pass.

Result: Experiments on nuScenes benchmark show ColaVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both open-loop and closed-loop settings with favorable efficiency and robustness.

Conclusion: ColaVLA preserves the generalization and interpretability of VLMs while enabling efficient, accurate and safe trajectory generation, addressing key limitations of current VLM-based planners for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires generating safe and reliable trajectories from complex multimodal inputs. Traditional modular pipelines separate perception, prediction, and planning, while recent end-to-end (E2E) systems learn them jointly. Vision-language models (VLMs) further enrich this paradigm by introducing cross-modal priors and commonsense reasoning, yet current VLM-based planners face three key challenges: (i) a mismatch between discrete text reasoning and continuous control, (ii) high latency from autoregressive chain-of-thought decoding, and (iii) inefficient or non-causal planners that limit real-time deployment. We propose ColaVLA, a unified vision-language-action framework that transfers reasoning from text to a unified latent space and couples it with a hierarchical, parallel trajectory decoder. The Cognitive Latent Reasoner compresses scene understanding into compact, decision-oriented meta-action embeddings through ego-adaptive selection and only two VLM forward passes. The Hierarchical Parallel Planner then generates multi-scale, causality-consistent trajectories in a single forward pass. Together, these components preserve the generalization and interpretability of VLMs while enabling efficient, accurate and safe trajectory generation. Experiments on the nuScenes benchmark show that ColaVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both open-loop and closed-loop settings with favorable efficiency and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing detection methods fail to adaptively focus on density-concentrated regions in high-resolution remote sensing imagery, where severe mutual occlusion and limited pixel footprints make tiny object detection extremely challenging.

Method: Proposes DRMNet with three key components: 1) Density Generation Branch to model object distribution patterns, 2) Dense Area Focusing Module that uses density maps to efficiently focus on dense regions, and 3) Dual Filter Fusion Module that disentangles multi-scale features into frequency components for density-guided cross-attention.

Result: Extensive experiments on AI-TOD and DTOD datasets show DRMNet surpasses state-of-the-art methods, particularly in complex scenarios with high object density and severe occlusion.

Conclusion: DRMNet effectively addresses the challenges of detecting dense tiny objects in remote sensing imagery by leveraging density maps as explicit spatial priors to guide adaptive feature learning, achieving superior performance in high-density scenarios.

Abstract: High-resolution remote sensing imagery increasingly contains dense clusters of tiny objects, the detection of which is extremely challenging due to severe mutual occlusion and limited pixel footprints. Existing detection methods typically allocate computational resources uniformly, failing to adaptively focus on these density-concentrated regions, which hinders feature learning effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose the Dense Region Mining Network (DRMNet), which leverages density maps as explicit spatial priors to guide adaptive feature learning. First, we design a Density Generation Branch (DGB) to model object distribution patterns, providing quantifiable priors that guide the network toward dense regions. Second, to address the computational bottleneck of global attention, our Dense Area Focusing Module (DAFM) uses these density maps to identify and focus on dense areas, enabling efficient local-global feature interaction. Finally, to mitigate feature degradation during hierarchical extraction, we introduce a Dual Filter Fusion Module (DFFM). It disentangles multi-scale features into high- and low-frequency components using a discrete cosine transform and then performs density-guided cross-attention to enhance complementarity while suppressing background interference. Extensive experiments on the AI-TOD and DTOD datasets demonstrate that DRMNet surpasses state-of-the-art methods, particularly in complex scenarios with high object density and severe occlusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches compromise visual fidelity for real-time performance in audio-driven avatar generation due to computational load vs. latency constraints, requiring a solution that maintains high quality while meeting real-time requirements.

Method: Introduces SoulX-LiveTalk with: 1) Self-correcting Bidirectional Distillation to retain bidirectional attention within video chunks, 2) Multi-step Retrospective Self-Correction Mechanism for error recovery during infinite generation, and 3) full-stack inference acceleration with hybrid sequence parallelism, Parallel VAE, and kernel-level optimizations.

Result: Achieves sub-second start-up latency (0.87s) and real-time throughput of 32 FPS, making it the first 14B-scale system to reach these performance metrics while maintaining high visual fidelity.

Conclusion: SoulX-LiveTalk sets a new standard for high-fidelity interactive digital human synthesis by balancing computational efficiency with visual quality through innovative attention mechanisms and optimization techniques.

Abstract: Deploying massive diffusion models for real-time, infinite-duration, audio-driven avatar generation presents a significant engineering challenge, primarily due to the conflict between computational load and strict latency constraints. Existing approaches often compromise visual fidelity by enforcing strictly unidirectional attention mechanisms or reducing model capacity. To address this problem, we introduce \textbf{SoulX-LiveTalk}, a 14B-parameter framework optimized for high-fidelity real-time streaming. Diverging from conventional unidirectional paradigms, we use a \textbf{Self-correcting Bidirectional Distillation} strategy that retains bidirectional attention within video chunks. This design preserves critical spatiotemporal correlations, significantly enhancing motion coherence and visual detail. To ensure stability during infinite generation, we incorporate a \textbf{Multi-step Retrospective Self-Correction Mechanism}, enabling the model to autonomously recover from accumulated errors and preventing collapse. Furthermore, we engineered a full-stack inference acceleration suite incorporating hybrid sequence parallelism, Parallel VAE, and kernel-level optimizations. Extensive evaluations confirm that SoulX-LiveTalk is the first 14B-scale system to achieve a \textbf{sub-second start-up latency (0.87s)} while reaching a real-time throughput of \textbf{32 FPS}, setting a new standard for high-fidelity interactive digital human synthesis.

Conclusion: Joint optimization with learnable text embeddings significantly enhances closed-set detection performance across diverse architectures and datasets in a detector-agnostic framework.

Abstract: Conventional object detectors rely on cross-entropy classification, which can be vulnerable to class imbalance and label noise. We propose CLIP-Joint-Detect, a simple and detector-agnostic framework that integrates CLIP-style contrastive vision-language supervision through end-to-end joint training. A lightweight parallel head projects region or grid features into the CLIP embedding space and aligns them with learnable class-specific text embeddings via InfoNCE contrastive loss and an auxiliary cross-entropy term, while all standard detection losses are optimized simultaneously. The approach applies seamlessly to both two-stage and one-stage architectures. We validate it on Pascal VOC 2007+2012 using Faster R-CNN and on the large-scale MS COCO 2017 benchmark using modern YOLO detectors (YOLOv11), achieving consistent and substantial improvements while preserving real-time inference speed. Extensive experiments and ablations demonstrate that joint optimization with learnable text embeddings markedly enhances closed-set detection performance across diverse architectures and datasets.

Abstract: Monitoring states of road surfaces provides valuable information for the planning and controlling vehicles and active vehicle control systems. Classical road monitoring methods are expensive and unsystematic because they require time for measurements. This article proposes an real time system based on weather conditional data and road surface condition data. For this purpose, we collected data with a mobile phone camera on the roads around the campus of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. We tested a large number of different image-based deep learning algorithms for road classification. In addition, we used road acceleration data along with road image data for training by using them as images. We compared the performances of acceleration-based and camera image-based approaches. The performances of the simple Alexnet, LeNet, VGG, and Resnet algorithms were compared as deep learning algorithms. For road condition classification, 5 classes were considered: asphalt, damaged asphalt, gravel road, damaged gravel road, pavement road and over 95% accuracy performance was achieved. It is also proposed to use the acceleration or the camera image to classify the road surface according to the weather and the time of day using fuzzy logic.

TL;DR: WRCFormer: A 3D object detection framework that fuses raw 4D radar cubes with camera data using multi-view representations and wavelet attention, achieving state-of-the-art performance on K-Radar benchmarks with improved robustness in adverse weather.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D mmWave radar is cost-effective and robust for autonomous driving but suffers from sparsity and limited semantic information. Camera-radar fusion is promising but faces challenges: point-cloud-based radar loses information through processing, while raw radar data is computationally expensive to use directly.

Method: WRCFormer fuses raw radar cubes with camera inputs via multi-view representations of decoupled radar cubes. Uses Wavelet Attention Module in wavelet-based FPN to enhance sparse radar and image representations. Employs Geometry-guided Progressive Fusion, a two-stage query-based modality-agnostic fusion mechanism to integrate multi-view features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on K-Radar benchmarks, surpassing best model by ~2.4% in all scenarios and 1.6% in sleet scenario, demonstrating robustness under adverse weather conditions.

Conclusion: WRCFormer effectively addresses computational and information loss challenges in radar-camera fusion by directly processing raw radar data with efficient multi-view representations and attention mechanisms, providing robust 3D object detection especially in adverse weather.

Abstract: 4D millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar has been widely adopted in autonomous driving and robot perception due to its low cost and all-weather robustness. However, its inherent sparsity and limited semantic richness significantly constrain perception capability. Recently, fusing camera data with 4D radar has emerged as a promising cost effective solution, by exploiting the complementary strengths of the two modalities. Nevertheless, point-cloud-based radar often suffer from information loss introduced by multi-stage signal processing, while directly utilizing raw 4D radar data incurs prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose WRCFormer, a novel 3D object detection framework that fuses raw radar cubes with camera inputs via multi-view representations of the decoupled radar cube. Specifically, we design a Wavelet Attention Module as the basic module of wavelet-based Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to enhance the representation of sparse radar signals and image data. We further introduce a two-stage query-based, modality-agnostic fusion mechanism termed Geometry-guided Progressive Fusion to efficiently integrate multi-view features from both modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WRCFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on the K-Radar benchmarks, surpassing the best model by approximately 2.4% in all scenarios and 1.6% in the sleet scenario, highlighting its robustness under adverse weather conditions.

TL;DR: CoFi-Dec is a training-free decoding framework that reduces hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models by integrating generative self-feedback with coarse-to-fine visual conditioning through Wasserstein-based fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs often produce hallucinated content inconsistent with visual inputs, limiting their reliability in real-world applications. There's a need for methods that reduce hallucinations without requiring additional training.

Method: Generates intermediate textual responses conditioned on coarse- and fine-grained image views, transforms them into synthetic images using text-to-image models, then uses Wasserstein-based fusion to align predictive distributions into a geometrically consistent decoding trajectory.

Result: Substantially reduces both entity-level and semantic-level hallucinations across six hallucination-focused benchmarks, outperforming existing decoding strategies while being model-agnostic and training-free.

Conclusion: CoFi-Dec provides an effective, training-free solution for mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs by combining generative self-feedback with multi-level visual conditioning and principled distribution fusion.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multi-modal understanding and generation. However, they still tend to produce hallucinated content that is inconsistent with the visual input, which limits their reliability in real-world applications. We propose \textbf{CoFi-Dec}, a training-free decoding framework that mitigates hallucinations by integrating generative self-feedback with coarse-to-fine visual conditioning. Inspired by the human visual process from global scene perception to detailed inspection, CoFi-Dec first generates two intermediate textual responses conditioned on coarse- and fine-grained views of the original image. These responses are then transformed into synthetic images using a text-to-image model, forming multi-level visual hypotheses that enrich grounding cues. To unify the predictions from these multiple visual conditions, we introduce a Wasserstein-based fusion mechanism that aligns their predictive distributions into a geometrically consistent decoding trajectory. This principled fusion reconciles high-level semantic consistency with fine-grained visual grounding, leading to more robust and faithful outputs. Extensive experiments on six hallucination-focused benchmarks show that CoFi-Dec substantially reduces both entity-level and semantic-level hallucinations, outperforming existing decoding strategies. The framework is model-agnostic, requires no additional training, and can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of LVLMs. The implementation is available at https://github.com/AI-Researcher-Team/CoFi-Dec.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOLO-IOD: A real-time incremental object detection framework built on YOLO-World that addresses catastrophic forgetting through conflict-aware pseudo-label refinement, importance-based kernel selection, and cross-stage asymmetric knowledge distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current incremental object detection methods rely on Faster R-CNN or DETR detectors and don't support real-time YOLO frameworks. There's a need for YOLO-based incremental detection that can handle catastrophic forgetting in real-time applications.

Method: Built on pretrained YOLO-World with stage-wise parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Three key components: 1) Conflict-Aware Pseudo-Label Refinement (CPR) to address foreground-background confusion, 2) Importance-based Kernel Selection (IKS) to identify and update crucial convolution kernels, 3) Cross-Stage Asymmetric Knowledge Distillation (CAKD) to handle misaligned knowledge distillation between existing and new categories.

Result: YOLO-IOD achieves superior performance with minimal forgetting on both conventional benchmarks and the new LoCo COCO benchmark (which eliminates data leakage across stages). The framework enables real-time incremental object detection.

Conclusion: YOLO-IOD successfully addresses three types of knowledge conflicts in YOLO-based incremental detectors, providing a real-time solution for incremental object detection with minimal catastrophic forgetting, validated on improved benchmarks.

Abstract: Current methods for incremental object detection (IOD) primarily rely on Faster R-CNN or DETR series detectors; however, these approaches do not accommodate the real-time YOLO detection frameworks. In this paper, we first identify three primary types of knowledge conflicts that contribute to catastrophic forgetting in YOLO-based incremental detectors: foreground-background confusion, parameter interference, and misaligned knowledge distillation. Subsequently, we introduce YOLO-IOD, a real-time Incremental Object Detection (IOD) framework that is constructed upon the pretrained YOLO-World model, facilitating incremental learning via a stage-wise parameter-efficient fine-tuning process. Specifically, YOLO-IOD encompasses three principal components: 1) Conflict-Aware Pseudo-Label Refinement (CPR), which mitigates the foreground-background confusion by leveraging the confidence levels of pseudo labels and identifying potential objects relevant to future tasks. 2) Importancebased Kernel Selection (IKS), which identifies and updates the pivotal convolution kernels pertinent to the current task during the current learning stage. 3) Cross-Stage Asymmetric Knowledge Distillation (CAKD), which addresses the misaligned knowledge distillation conflict by transmitting the features of the student target detector through the detection heads of both the previous and current teacher detectors, thereby facilitating asymmetric distillation between existing and newly introduced categories. We further introduce LoCo COCO, a more realistic benchmark that eliminates data leakage across stages. Experiments on both conventional and LoCo COCO benchmarks show that YOLO-IOD achieves superior performance with minimal forgetting.

TL;DR: ReamCamo: A unified out-painting framework for realistic camouflaged image generation with layout controls and multi-modal guidance to address visual similarity and semantic coherence gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing camouflaged image generation (CIG) methods have substantial gaps to real imagery - either lacking sufficient camouflage due to weak visual similarity, or having cluttered backgrounds that are semantically inconsistent with foreground targets.

Method: Proposes ReamCamo, a unified out-painting based framework with: 1) explicit layout controls to regulate global image structure and improve semantic coherence, 2) multi-modal textual-visual conditions combining fine-grained textual task descriptions with texture-oriented background retrieval, and 3) a background-foreground distribution divergence metric to quantitatively assess camouflage quality.

Result: Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in generating realistic camouflaged images.

Conclusion: ReamCamo addresses key limitations in existing CIG methods by improving both visual similarity and semantic coherence between foreground objects and generated backgrounds, providing a more realistic solution for camouflaged image generation.

Abstract: Camouflaged image generation (CIG) has recently emerged as an efficient alternative for acquiring high-quality training data for camouflaged object detection (COD). However, existing CIG methods still suffer from a substantial gap to real camouflaged imagery: generated images either lack sufficient camouflage due to weak visual similarity, or exhibit cluttered backgrounds that are semantically inconsistent with foreground targets. To address these limitations, we propose ReamCamo, a unified out-painting based framework for realistic camouflaged image generation. ReamCamo explicitly introduces additional layout controls to regulate global image structure, thereby improving semantic coherence between foreground objects and generated backgrounds. Moreover, we construct a multi-modal textual-visual condition by combining a unified fine-grained textual task description with texture-oriented background retrieval, which jointly guides the generation process to enhance visual fidelity and realism. To quantitatively assess camouflage quality, we further introduce a background-foreground distribution divergence metric that measures the effectiveness of camouflage in generated images. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

TL;DR: PoseStreamer: A multi-modal 6DoF pose estimation framework using event cameras for high-speed moving objects, featuring temporal consistency, 2D tracking priors, and geometric refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RGB cameras struggle with motion blur in high-speed, low-light scenarios for 6DoF pose estimation. Event cameras offer high temporal resolution but current methods still have suboptimal performance for fast-moving objects.

Method: Three core components: 1) Adaptive Pose Memory Queue for temporal consistency using historical orientation cues, 2) Object-centric 2D Tracker providing strong 2D priors to boost 3D center recall, and 3) Ray Pose Filter for geometric refinement along camera rays. Template-free framework for unseen objects.

Result: Superior accuracy in high-speed moving scenarios and strong generalizability as a template-free framework for unseen moving objects, validated through extensive experiments on the novel MoCapCube6D dataset.

Conclusion: PoseStreamer effectively addresses 6DoF pose estimation challenges in high-speed scenarios by leveraging event cameras and multi-modal integration, demonstrating robust performance and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Six degree of freedom (6DoF) pose estimation for novel objects is a critical task in computer vision, yet it faces significant challenges in high-speed and low-light scenarios where standard RGB cameras suffer from motion blur. While event cameras offer a promising solution due to their high temporal resolution, current 6DoF pose estimation methods typically yield suboptimal performance in high-speed object moving scenarios. To address this gap, we propose PoseStreamer, a robust multi-modal 6DoF pose estimation framework designed specifically on high-speed moving scenarios. Our approach integrates three core components: an Adaptive Pose Memory Queue that utilizes historical orientation cues for temporal consistency, an Object-centric 2D Tracker that provides strong 2D priors to boost 3D center recall, and a Ray Pose Filter for geometric refinement along camera rays. Furthermore, we introduce MoCapCube6D, a novel multi-modal dataset constructed to benchmark performance under rapid motion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PoseStreamer not only achieves superior accuracy in high-speed moving scenarios, but also exhibits strong generalizability as a template-free framework for unseen moving objects.

TL;DR: AnyMS is a training-free framework for multi-subject customization that uses layout guidance and dual-level attention decoupling to balance text alignment, subject identity preservation, and layout control without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-subject customization methods struggle to balance text alignment, subject identity preservation, and layout control, while requiring additional training that limits scalability and efficiency.

Method: AnyMS uses a training-free framework with three inputs (text prompt, subject images, layout constraints) and introduces bottom-up dual-level attention decoupling: global decoupling separates text-visual attention for text alignment, and local decoupling confines each subject's attention to its designated area to prevent conflicts.

Result: Extensive experiments show AnyMS achieves state-of-the-art performance, supports complex compositions, and scales to larger numbers of subjects without requiring subject learning or adapter tuning.

Conclusion: AnyMS presents an effective training-free solution for layout-guided multi-subject customization that successfully balances the three critical objectives while maintaining scalability and efficiency.

Abstract: Multi-subject customization aims to synthesize multiple user-specified subjects into a coherent image. To address issues such as subjects missing or conflicts, recent works incorporate layout guidance to provide explicit spatial constraints. However, existing methods still struggle to balance three critical objectives: text alignment, subject identity preservation, and layout control, while the reliance on additional training further limits their scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we present AnyMS, a novel training-free framework for layout-guided multi-subject customization. AnyMS leverages three input conditions: text prompt, subject images, and layout constraints, and introduces a bottom-up dual-level attention decoupling mechanism to harmonize their integration during generation. Specifically, global decoupling separates cross-attention between textual and visual conditions to ensure text alignment. Local decoupling confines each subject's attention to its designated area, which prevents subject conflicts and thus guarantees identity preservation and layout control. Moreover, AnyMS employs pre-trained image adapters to extract subject-specific features aligned with the diffusion model, removing the need for subject learning or adapter tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnyMS achieves state-of-the-art performance, supporting complex compositions and scaling to a larger number of subjects.

### [120] [Spatial-aware Symmetric Alignment for Text-guided Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22981)
*Linglin Liao,Qichuan Geng,Yu Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSA framework improves medical image segmentation by better handling hybrid medical texts (locational, descriptive, diagnostic) through symmetric optimal transport alignment and spatial constraint guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-guided medical image segmentation methods struggle with processing both diagnostic and descriptive texts simultaneously, and fail to capture positional constraints, leading to inaccurate segmentation (e.g., mislocating lesions despite clear spatial text descriptions).

Method: Proposes Spatial-aware Symmetric Alignment (SSA) framework with: 1) symmetric optimal transport alignment mechanism for bi-directional fine-grained multimodal correspondences between image regions and multiple text expressions, and 2) composite directional guidance strategy using region-level guidance masks to explicitly introduce spatial constraints from text.

Result: Extensive experiments on public benchmarks show SSA achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly excelling at accurately segmenting lesions with spatial relational constraints.

Conclusion: SSA effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by enhancing the capacity to process hybrid medical texts with spatial awareness, leading to more accurate medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Text-guided Medical Image Segmentation has shown considerable promise for medical image segmentation, with rich clinical text serving as an effective supplement for scarce data. However, current methods have two key bottlenecks. On one hand, they struggle to process diagnostic and descriptive texts simultaneously, making it difficult to identify lesions and establish associations with image regions. On the other hand, existing approaches focus on lesions description and fail to capture positional constraints, leading to critical deviations. Specifically, with the text "in the left lower lung", the segmentation results may incorrectly cover both sides of the lung. To address the limitations, we propose the Spatial-aware Symmetric Alignment (SSA) framework to enhance the capacity of referring hybrid medical texts consisting of locational, descriptive, and diagnostic information. Specifically, we propose symmetric optimal transport alignment mechanism to strengthen the associations between image regions and multiple relevant expressions, which establishes bi-directional fine-grained multimodal correspondences. In addition, we devise a composite directional guidance strategy that explicitly introduces spatial constraints in the text by constructing region-level guidance masks. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that SSA achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, particularly in accurately segmenting lesions characterized by spatial relational constraints.

TL;DR: Reverse personalization framework for face anonymization using conditional diffusion inversion without text prompts, achieving SOTA balance between identity removal, attribute preservation, and image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt-based methods for identity removal/modification either require subjects to be well-represented in pre-trained models or need model fine-tuning for specific identities, lacking control over facial attributes during anonymization.

Method: Reverse personalization framework leveraging conditional diffusion inversion for direct image manipulation without text prompts, incorporating identity-guided conditioning branch to generalize beyond training subjects, enabling attribute-controllable anonymization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art balance between identity removal, attribute preservation, and image quality, demonstrating superior performance compared to prior anonymization methods.

Conclusion: Proposed framework enables effective face anonymization with attribute control without requiring text prompts or subject-specific fine-tuning, advancing privacy-preserving facial image generation.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generation of realistic facial images conditioned on textual prompts and human identities, enabling creating personalized facial imagery. However, existing prompt-based methods for removing or modifying identity-specific features rely either on the subject being well-represented in the pre-trained model or require model fine-tuning for specific identities. In this work, we analyze the identity generation process and introduce a reverse personalization framework for face anonymization. Our approach leverages conditional diffusion inversion, allowing direct manipulation of images without using text prompts. To generalize beyond subjects in the model's training data, we incorporate an identity-guided conditioning branch. Unlike prior anonymization methods, which lack control over facial attributes, our framework supports attribute-controllable anonymization. We demonstrate that our method achieves a state-of-the-art balance between identity removal, attribute preservation, and image quality.

TL;DR: PathFound is an agentic multimodal model for pathology that enables evidence-seeking inference through proactive information acquisition and diagnosis refinement, improving diagnostic accuracy over static inference methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pathological foundation models use static inference where whole-slide images are processed once without reassessment, unlike clinical workflows that refine hypotheses through repeated observations and further examinations.

Method: PathFound integrates pathological visual foundation models, vision-language models, and reasoning models trained with reinforcement learning to perform proactive information acquisition through three stages: initial diagnosis, evidence-seeking, and final decision.

Result: The evidence-seeking strategy consistently improves diagnostic accuracy across several large multimodal models. PathFound achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic performance across diverse clinical scenarios and demonstrates strong potential to discover subtle details like nuclear features and local invasions.

Conclusion: Evidence-seeking workflows are effective in computational pathology, and PathFound represents an advanced approach that better mimics clinical diagnostic workflows through proactive information acquisition and refinement.

Abstract: Recent pathological foundation models have substantially advanced visual representation learning and multimodal interaction. However, most models still rely on a static inference paradigm in which whole-slide images are processed once to produce predictions, without reassessment or targeted evidence acquisition under ambiguous diagnoses. This contrasts with clinical diagnostic workflows that refine hypotheses through repeated slide observations and further examination requests. We propose PathFound, an agentic multimodal model designed to support evidence-seeking inference in pathological diagnosis. PathFound integrates the power of pathological visual foundation models, vision-language models, and reasoning models trained with reinforcement learning to perform proactive information acquisition and diagnosis refinement by progressing through the initial diagnosis, evidence-seeking, and final decision stages. Across several large multimodal models, adopting this strategy consistently improves diagnostic accuracy, indicating the effectiveness of evidence-seeking workflows in computational pathology. Among these models, PathFound achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic performance across diverse clinical scenarios and demonstrates strong potential to discover subtle details, such as nuclear features and local invasions.

TL;DR: RxnBench is a new benchmark for evaluating Multimodal LLMs on chemical reaction understanding from scientific PDFs, revealing significant gaps in models' ability to comprehend chemical logic and integrate multimodal information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While MLLMs show promise for revolutionizing chemistry, their ability to understand the dense graphical language of chemical reactions in real scientific literature remains underexplored and needs rigorous evaluation.

Method: Created RxnBench with two tasks: Single-Figure QA (1,525 questions from 305 reaction schemes) testing visual perception and mechanistic reasoning, and Full-Document QA (108 articles) requiring cross-modal integration of text, schemes, and tables.

Result: MLLMs excel at extracting explicit text but struggle with deep chemical logic and precise structural recognition. Models with inference-time reasoning outperform standard architectures, but none achieve 50% accuracy on Full-Document QA.

Conclusion: There's an urgent need for domain-specific visual encoders and stronger reasoning engines to advance autonomous AI chemists, as current MLLMs have critical capability gaps in chemical reaction understanding.

Abstract: The integration of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into chemistry promises to revolutionize scientific discovery, yet their ability to comprehend the dense, graphical language of reactions within authentic literature remains underexplored. Here, we introduce RxnBench, a multi-tiered benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate MLLMs on chemical reaction understanding from scientific PDFs. RxnBench comprises two tasks: Single-Figure QA (SF-QA), which tests fine-grained visual perception and mechanistic reasoning using 1,525 questions derived from 305 curated reaction schemes, and Full-Document QA (FD-QA), which challenges models to synthesize information from 108 articles, requiring cross-modal integration of text, schemes, and tables. Our evaluation of MLLMs reveals a critical capability gap: while models excel at extracting explicit text, they struggle with deep chemical logic and precise structural recognition. Notably, models with inference-time reasoning significantly outperform standard architectures, yet none achieve 50\% accuracy on FD-QA. These findings underscore the urgent need for domain-specific visual encoders and stronger reasoning engines to advance autonomous AI chemists.

### [125] [With Great Context Comes Great Prediction Power: Classifying Objects via Geo-Semantic Scene Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23024)
*Ciprian Constantinescu,Marius Leordeanu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel graph-based framework for object classification that leverages explicit scene context through a Geo-Semantic Contextual Graph, dramatically outperforming context-agnostic and state-of-the-art baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans use rich scene context (spatial relationships, material properties, object co-occurrence) for object recognition, but most computational systems operate on isolated image regions, ignoring this vital contextual information.

Method: Constructs a Geo-Semantic Contextual Graph (GSCG) from monocular images by integrating metric depth estimation with unified panoptic and material segmentation. Objects become nodes with geometric, chromatic, and material attributes; spatial relationships become edges. Uses a specialized graph-based classifier that aggregates features from target objects, immediate neighbors, and global scene context.

Result: Achieves 73.4% classification accuracy on COCO 2017, dramatically outperforming context-agnostic versions (38.4%), fine-tuned ResNet models (max 53.5%), and state-of-the-art multimodal LLM Llama 4 Scout (42.3%).

Conclusion: Explicitly structured and interpretable context representation through GSCG significantly improves object recognition, demonstrating the superiority of context-aware approaches over traditional isolated methods and even advanced multimodal models.

Abstract: Humans effortlessly identify objects by leveraging a rich understanding of the surrounding scene, including spatial relationships, material properties, and the co-occurrence of other objects. In contrast, most computational object recognition systems operate on isolated image regions, devoid of meaning in isolation, thus ignoring this vital contextual information. This paper argues for the critical role of context and introduces a novel framework for contextual object classification. We first construct a Geo-Semantic Contextual Graph (GSCG) from a single monocular image. This rich, structured representation is built by integrating a metric depth estimator with a unified panoptic and material segmentation model. The GSCG encodes objects as nodes with detailed geometric, chromatic, and material attributes, and their spatial relationships as edges. This explicit graph structure makes the model's reasoning process inherently interpretable. We then propose a specialized graph-based classifier that aggregates features from a target object, its immediate neighbors, and the global scene context to predict its class. Through extensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that our context-aware model achieves a classification accuracy of 73.4%, dramatically outperforming context-agnostic versions (as low as 38.4%). Furthermore, our GSCG-based approach significantly surpasses strong baselines, including fine-tuned ResNet models (max 53.5%) and a state-of-the-art multimodal Large Language Model (LLM), Llama 4 Scout, which, even when given the full image alongside a detailed description of objects, maxes out at 42.3%. These results on COCO 2017 train/val splits highlight the superiority of explicitly structured and interpretable context for object recognition tasks.

TL;DR: Co2S is a stable semi-supervised remote sensing image segmentation framework that fuses CLIP and DINOv3 priors to mitigate pseudo-label drift through dual-student architecture with semantic co-guidance and feature fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semi-supervised remote sensing segmentation suffers from pseudo-label drift where confirmation bias leads to error accumulation during training, requiring stabilization methods.

Method: Heterogeneous dual-student architecture with CLIP and DINOv3 ViTs, explicit-implicit semantic co-guidance using text embeddings and learnable queries, and global-local feature collaborative fusion strategy.

Result: Extensive experiments on six datasets show leading performance across various partition protocols and diverse scenarios, demonstrating superiority over existing methods.

Conclusion: Co2S effectively mitigates pseudo-label drift in semi-supervised RS segmentation by synergistically fusing vision-language and self-supervised model priors through innovative architectural and guidance mechanisms.

Abstract: Semi-supervised remote sensing (RS) image semantic segmentation offers a promising solution to alleviate the burden of exhaustive annotation, yet it fundamentally struggles with pseudo-label drift, a phenomenon where confirmation bias leads to the accumulation of errors during training. In this work, we propose Co2S, a stable semi-supervised RS segmentation framework that synergistically fuses priors from vision-language models and self-supervised models. Specifically, we construct a heterogeneous dual-student architecture comprising two distinct ViT-based vision foundation models initialized with pretrained CLIP and DINOv3 to mitigate error accumulation and pseudo-label drift. To effectively incorporate these distinct priors, an explicit-implicit semantic co-guidance mechanism is introduced that utilizes text embeddings and learnable queries to provide explicit and implicit class-level guidance, respectively, thereby jointly enhancing semantic consistency. Furthermore, a global-local feature collaborative fusion strategy is developed to effectively fuse the global contextual information captured by CLIP with the local details produced by DINOv3, enabling the model to generate highly precise segmentation results. Extensive experiments on six popular datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, which consistently achieves leading performance across various partition protocols and diverse scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LAM3C learns 3D representations from unlabeled videos without real 3D sensors, using video-generated point clouds and noise-regularized loss, achieving state-of-the-art performance on indoor segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting large-scale 3D scene scans is expensive and labor-intensive, so the paper investigates whether 3D representations can be learned from abundant, freely available unlabeled videos without any real 3D sensors.

Method: Proposes LAM3C framework with: 1) RoomTours dataset of 49,219 video-generated point clouds from web videos, 2) Laplacian-aware multi-level 3D clustering with Sinkhorn-Knopp for self-supervised learning, and 3) noise-regularized loss enforcing local geometric smoothness and feature stability under noisy point clouds.

Result: Without using any real 3D scans, LAM3C achieves higher performance than previous self-supervised methods on indoor semantic and instance segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: Unlabeled videos represent an abundant and effective source of data for 3D self-supervised learning, enabling high-quality 3D representation learning without expensive 3D sensor data collection.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in 3D self-supervised learning, collecting large-scale 3D scene scans remains expensive and labor-intensive. In this work, we investigate whether 3D representations can be learned from unlabeled videos recorded without any real 3D sensors. We present Laplacian-Aware Multi-level 3D Clustering with Sinkhorn-Knopp (LAM3C), a self-supervised framework that learns from video-generated point clouds from unlabeled videos. We first introduce RoomTours, a video-generated point cloud dataset constructed by collecting room-walkthrough videos from the web (e.g., real-estate tours) and generating 49,219 scenes using an off-the-shelf feed-forward reconstruction model. We also propose a noise-regularized loss that stabilizes representation learning by enforcing local geometric smoothness and ensuring feature stability under noisy point clouds. Remarkably, without using any real 3D scans, LAM3C achieves higher performance than the previous self-supervised methods on indoor semantic and instance segmentation. These results suggest that unlabeled videos represent an abundant source of data for 3D self-supervised learning.

TL;DR: Video-BrowseComp is a new benchmark for evaluating agentic video reasoning on the open web, requiring active navigation of video timelines to verify claims rather than passive perception or text search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video benchmarks focus on passive perception with curated clips, failing to evaluate the proactive, open-ended video research needed for autonomous agents. There's a modality gap in processing dynamic video content on the web.

Method: Created Video-BrowseComp benchmark with 210 questions that enforce mandatory dependency on temporal visual evidence. Questions require navigating video timelines to verify external claims rather than relying on text search or metadata.

Result: State-of-the-art models perform poorly, with GPT-5.1 (w/ Search) achieving only 15.24% accuracy. Models rely heavily on textual proxies, performing well in metadata-rich domains but failing in metadata-sparse, dynamic environments like sports and gameplay.

Conclusion: Video-BrowseComp advances video understanding beyond passive perception toward proactive video reasoning, revealing critical bottlenecks in current models' ability to perform agentic video research on the open web.

Abstract: The evolution of autonomous agents is redefining information seeking, transitioning from passive retrieval to proactive, open-ended web research. However, while textual and static multimodal agents have seen rapid progress, a significant modality gap remains in processing the web's most dynamic modality: video. Existing video benchmarks predominantly focus on passive perception, feeding curated clips to models without requiring external retrieval. They fail to evaluate agentic video research, which necessitates actively interrogating video timelines, cross-referencing dispersed evidence, and verifying claims against the open web. To bridge this gap, we present \textbf{Video-BrowseComp}, a challenging benchmark comprising 210 questions tailored for open-web agentic video reasoning. Unlike prior benchmarks, Video-BrowseComp enforces a mandatory dependency on temporal visual evidence, ensuring that answers cannot be derived solely through text search but require navigating video timelines to verify external claims. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals a critical bottleneck: even advanced search-augmented models like GPT-5.1 (w/ Search) achieve only 15.24\% accuracy. Our analysis reveals that these models largely rely on textual proxies, excelling in metadata-rich domains (e.g., TV shows with plot summaries) but collapsing in metadata-sparse, dynamic environments (e.g., sports, gameplay) where visual grounding is essential. As the first open-web video research benchmark, Video-BrowseComp advances the field beyond passive perception toward proactive video reasoning.

### [129] [Domain-Shift Immunity in Deep Deformable Registration via Local Feature Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23142)
*Mingzhen Shao,Sarang Joshi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep deformable registration models are inherently robust to domain shift due to reliance on local features, not global appearance, as demonstrated by UniReg framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning-based deformable registration models are believed to be sensitive to domain shift, but the underlying mechanisms aren't well understood. The paper aims to investigate whether domain-shift immunity is an inherent property of these models.

Method: Introduces UniReg, a universal registration framework that decouples feature extraction from deformation estimation using fixed pre-trained feature extractors and a UNet-based deformation network. Trained on a single dataset but tested across domains.

Result: UniReg exhibits robust cross-domain and multi-modal performance comparable to optimization-based methods despite single-dataset training. Analysis shows conventional CNN failures under modality shift stem from dataset-induced biases in early convolutional layers.

Conclusion: Local feature consistency is the key driver of robustness in learning-based deformable registration. This motivates backbone designs that preserve domain-invariant local features rather than relying on large diverse training datasets.

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced deformable image registration, surpassing traditional optimization-based methods in both accuracy and efficiency. However, learning-based models are widely believed to be sensitive to domain shift, with robustness typically pursued through large and diverse training datasets, without explaining the underlying mechanisms. In this work, we show that domain-shift immunity is an inherent property of deep deformable registration models, arising from their reliance on local feature representations rather than global appearance for deformation estimation. To isolate and validate this mechanism, we introduce UniReg, a universal registration framework that decouples feature extraction from deformation estimation using fixed, pre-trained feature extractors and a UNet-based deformation network. Despite training on a single dataset, UniReg exhibits robust cross-domain and multi-modal performance comparable to optimization-based methods. Our analysis further reveals that failures of conventional CNN-based models under modality shift originate from dataset-induced biases in early convolutional layers. These findings identify local feature consistency as the key driver of robustness in learning-based deformable registration and motivate backbone designs that preserve domain-invariant local features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semi-supervised 3D detection methods overlook that models with limited labeled data struggle to capture geometric information, which is crucial for object perception and localization.

Method: Proposes GeoTeacher with: 1) keypoint-based geometric relation supervision to transfer teacher's geometric knowledge to student, 2) voxel-wise data augmentation with distance-decay mechanism to diversify object geometries while preserving distant objects.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on ONCE and Waymo datasets, demonstrating effectiveness and generalization; can be combined with different SS3D methods for further improvement.

Conclusion: GeoTeacher effectively enhances student models' geometric understanding in semi-supervised 3D object detection, leading to superior performance and broad applicability.

Abstract: Semi-supervised 3D object detection, aiming to explore unlabeled data for boosting 3D object detectors, has emerged as an active research area in recent years. Some previous methods have shown substantial improvements by either employing heterogeneous teacher models to provide high-quality pseudo labels or enforcing feature-perspective consistency between the teacher and student networks. However, these methods overlook the fact that the model usually tends to exhibit low sensitivity to object geometries with limited labeled data, making it difficult to capture geometric information, which is crucial for enhancing the student model's ability in object perception and localization. In this paper, we propose GeoTeacher to enhance the student model's ability to capture geometric relations of objects with limited training data, especially unlabeled data. We design a keypoint-based geometric relation supervision module that transfers the teacher model's knowledge of object geometry to the student, thereby improving the student's capability in understanding geometric relations. Furthermore, we introduce a voxel-wise data augmentation strategy that increases the diversity of object geometries, thereby further improving the student model's ability to comprehend geometric structures. To preserve the integrity of distant objects during augmentation, we incorporate a distance-decay mechanism into this strategy. Moreover, GeoTeacher can be combined with different SS3D methods to further improve their performance. Extensive experiments on the ONCE and Waymo datasets indicate the effectiveness and generalization of our method and we achieve the new state-of-the-art results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for text-to-image alignment rely on coarse-grained metrics or static QA pipelines that lack fine-grained interpretability and struggle to reflect human preferences.

Method: Uses a structured "grounding-reasoning-conclusion" paradigm with MLLMs to localize semantic elements and derive interpretable alignment judgments, optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a composite reward function incorporating structural format, grounding accuracy, and alignment fidelity.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across four benchmarks (EvalMuse-40K, RichHF, MHaluBench, GenAI-Bench), outperforming both proprietary models and supervised baselines while demonstrating superior inference efficiency compared to existing iterative visual reasoning methods.

Conclusion: REVEALER provides a unified, interpretable framework for fine-grained element-level alignment evaluation that better reflects human preferences and offers practical efficiency advantages over existing methods.

Abstract: Evaluating the alignment between textual prompts and generated images is critical for ensuring the reliability and usability of text-to-image (T2I) models. However, most existing evaluation methods rely on coarse-grained metrics or static QA pipelines, which lack fine-grained interpretability and struggle to reflect human preferences. To address this, we propose REVEALER, a unified framework for element-level alignment evaluation based on reinforcement-guided visual reasoning. Adopting a structured "grounding-reasoning-conclusion" paradigm, our method enables Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to explicitly localize semantic elements and derive interpretable alignment judgments. We optimize the model via Group Relative Policy Optimization(GRPO) using a composite reward function that incorporates structural format, grounding accuracy, and alignment fidelity. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks-EvalMuse-40K, RichHF, MHaluBench, and GenAI-Bench-demonstrate that REVEALER achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our approach consistently outperforms both strong proprietary models and supervised baselines while demonstrating superior inference efficiency compared to existing iterative visual reasoning methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GVSynergy-Det is a novel image-based 3D object detection framework that synergistically combines Gaussian and voxel representations to achieve state-of-the-art performance without requiring depth sensors or dense 3D supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image-based 3D detection faces a dilemma: methods needing dense 3D supervision achieve high accuracy but require expensive sensors, while unsupervised methods struggle with accurate geometry extraction from images alone.

Method: Uses dual-representation architecture with continuous Gaussian and discrete voxel representations, adapting Gaussian Splatting for geometric features and developing cross-representation enhancement to enrich voxel features with Gaussian geometric details.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging indoor benchmarks (ScanNetV2 and ARKitScenes), significantly outperforming existing methods without requiring depth or dense 3D geometry supervision.

Conclusion: The synergistic combination of Gaussian and voxel representations enables accurate 3D object detection from images alone, overcoming limitations of previous approaches that relied on per-scene optimization or used Gaussian representations only for depth regularization.

Abstract: Image-based 3D object detection aims to identify and localize objects in 3D space using only RGB images, eliminating the need for expensive depth sensors required by point cloud-based methods. Existing image-based approaches face two critical challenges: methods achieving high accuracy typically require dense 3D supervision, while those operating without such supervision struggle to extract accurate geometry from images alone. In this paper, we present GVSynergy-Det, a novel framework that enhances 3D detection through synergistic Gaussian-Voxel representation learning. Our key insight is that continuous Gaussian and discrete voxel representations capture complementary geometric information: Gaussians excel at modeling fine-grained surface details while voxels provide structured spatial context. We introduce a dual-representation architecture that: 1) adapts generalizable Gaussian Splatting to extract complementary geometric features for detection tasks, and 2) develops a cross-representation enhancement mechanism that enriches voxel features with geometric details from Gaussian fields. Unlike previous methods that either rely on time-consuming per-scene optimization or utilize Gaussian representations solely for depth regularization, our synergistic strategy directly leverages features from both representations through learnable integration, enabling more accurate object localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GVSynergy-Det achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging indoor benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing methods on both ScanNetV2 and ARKitScenes datasets, all without requiring any depth or dense 3D geometry supervision (e.g., point clouds or TSDF).

TL;DR: A unified Driving World Model using 3D Gaussian scene representation that enables both 3D scene understanding and multi-modal generation through early modality alignment and language-guided sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Driving World Models lack 3D scene understanding capabilities and can only generate content conditioned on input data without reasoning about the driving environment. Current approaches using point clouds or BEV features fail to accurately align textual information with 3D scenes.

Method: Proposes a unified DWM framework based on 3D Gaussian scene representation that embeds linguistic features into each Gaussian primitive for early modality alignment. Includes task-aware language-guided sampling to remove redundant Gaussians and inject compact 3D tokens into LLMs, plus a dual-condition multi-modal generation model combining high-level language and low-level image conditions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes and NuInteract datasets, validating the effectiveness of the framework for 3D scene understanding and multi-modal generation.

Conclusion: The proposed 3D Gaussian-based DWM framework successfully addresses limitations of existing approaches by enabling both 3D scene understanding and multi-modal generation through better modality alignment and efficient representation, with code to be publicly released.

Abstract: Driving World Models (DWMs) have been developing rapidly with the advances of generative models. However, existing DWMs lack 3D scene understanding capabilities and can only generate content conditioned on input data, without the ability to interpret or reason about the driving environment. Moreover, current approaches represent 3D spatial information with point cloud or BEV features do not accurately align textual information with the underlying 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel unified DWM framework based on 3D Gaussian scene representation, which enables both 3D scene understanding and multi-modal scene generation, while also enabling contextual enrichment for understanding and generation tasks. Our approach directly aligns textual information with the 3D scene by embedding rich linguistic features into each Gaussian primitive, thereby achieving early modality alignment. In addition, we design a novel task-aware language-guided sampling strategy that removes redundant 3D Gaussians and injects accurate and compact 3D tokens into LLM. Furthermore, we design a dual-condition multi-modal generation model, where the information captured by our vision-language model is leveraged as a high-level language condition in combination with a low-level image condition, jointly guiding the multi-modal generation process. We conduct comprehensive studies on the nuScenes, and NuInteract datasets to validate the effectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. We will release the code publicly on GitHub https://github.com/dtc111111/GaussianDWM.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes adaptive timestep selection and feature consolidation for diffusion models to improve few-shot dense prediction performance without heuristic timestep choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models rely on heuristic selection of diffusion timestep features for single-task prediction, leading to sub-optimal performance biased toward certain tasks. Need adaptive approach for few-shot dense prediction on arbitrary unseen tasks.

Method: Two modules: Task-aware Timestep Selection (TTS) selects ideal diffusion timesteps based on timestep-wise losses and similarity scores; Timestep Feature Consolidation (TFC) consolidates selected timestep features. Uses parameter-efficient fine-tuning adapter for few-shot learning.

Result: Achieves superior dense prediction performance with only a few support queries. Validated on large-scale Taskonomy dataset for dense prediction in universal and few-shot learning scenarios.

Conclusion: Proposed adaptive timestep selection and consolidation framework effectively addresses heuristic limitations in diffusion models, enabling better few-shot dense prediction performance across arbitrary tasks.

Abstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models have brought tremendous advances in generative tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance thus far. Current diffusion model-based applications exploit the power of learned visual representations from multistep forward-backward Markovian processes for single-task prediction tasks by attaching a task-specific decoder. However, the heuristic selection of diffusion timestep features still heavily relies on empirical intuition, often leading to sub-optimal performance biased towards certain tasks. To alleviate this constraint, we investigate the significance of versatile diffusion timestep features by adaptively selecting timesteps best suited for the few-shot dense prediction task, evaluated on an arbitrary unseen task. To this end, we propose two modules: Task-aware Timestep Selection (TTS) to select ideal diffusion timesteps based on timestep-wise losses and similarity scores, and Timestep Feature Consolidation (TFC) to consolidate the selected timestep features to improve the dense predictive performance in a few-shot setting. Accompanied by our parameter-efficient fine-tuning adapter, our framework effectively achieves superiority in dense prediction performance given only a few support queries. We empirically validate our learnable timestep consolidation method on the large-scale challenging Taskonomy dataset for dense prediction, particularly for practical universal and few-shot learning scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for reliable detection of small road hazards in real-time under varying adverse conditions (weather, daylight), lacking datasets with obstacles in same visual domain as other classes

Method: Introduce AVOID dataset collected in simulated environment with unexpected road obstacles under various weather/time conditions, includes semantic/depth maps, LiDAR data, waypoints; benchmark real-time networks and propose multi-task network for segmentation, depth, waypoint prediction

Result: Dataset supports most visual perception tasks; benchmark results on high-performing real-time networks for obstacle detection; ablation studies using comprehensive multi-task network

Conclusion: AVOID addresses gap in road driving datasets by providing comprehensive multi-modal data for obstacle detection under adverse conditions, enabling better real-time perception for self-driving cars

Abstract: Understanding road scenes for visual perception remains crucial for intelligent self-driving cars. In particular, it is desirable to detect unexpected small road hazards reliably in real-time, especially under varying adverse conditions (e.g., weather and daylight). However, existing road driving datasets provide large-scale images acquired in either normal or adverse scenarios only, and often do not contain the road obstacles captured in the same visual domain as for the other classes. To address this, we introduce a new dataset called AVOID, the Adverse Visual Conditions Dataset, for real-time obstacle detection collected in a simulated environment. AVOID consists of a large set of unexpected road obstacles located along each path captured under various weather and time conditions. Each image is coupled with the corresponding semantic and depth maps, raw and semantic LiDAR data, and waypoints, thereby supporting most visual perception tasks. We benchmark the results on high-performing real-time networks for the obstacle detection task, and also propose and conduct ablation studies using a comprehensive multi-task network for semantic segmentation, depth and waypoint prediction tasks.

TL;DR: MM-UAVBench: A comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in low-altitude UAV scenarios across perception, cognition, and planning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM benchmarks don't adequately cover low-altitude UAV scenarios, and existing UAV evaluations focus on specific tasks rather than assessing MLLMs' general intelligence in these complex environments.

Method: Created MM-UAVBench with 19 sub-tasks and over 5.7K manually annotated questions derived from real-world UAV data from public datasets. Evaluated 16 open-source and proprietary MLLMs across three core capability dimensions.

Result: Current MLLMs struggle to adapt to complex visual and cognitive demands of low-altitude scenarios. Analysis revealed critical bottlenecks including spatial bias and multi-view understanding limitations.

Conclusion: MM-UAVBench provides a unified evaluation framework to foster research on robust and reliable MLLMs for real-world UAV intelligence applications.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited remarkable general intelligence across diverse domains, their potential in low-altitude applications dominated by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) remains largely underexplored. Existing MLLM benchmarks rarely cover the unique challenges of low-altitude scenarios, while UAV-related evaluations mainly focus on specific tasks such as localization or navigation, without a unified evaluation of MLLMs'general intelligence. To bridge this gap, we present MM-UAVBench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates MLLMs across three core capability dimensions-perception, cognition, and planning-in low-altitude UAV scenarios. MM-UAVBench comprises 19 sub-tasks with over 5.7K manually annotated questions, all derived from real-world UAV data collected from public datasets. Extensive experiments on 16 open-source and proprietary MLLMs reveal that current models struggle to adapt to the complex visual and cognitive demands of low-altitude scenarios. Our analyses further uncover critical bottlenecks such as spatial bias and multi-view understanding that hinder the effective deployment of MLLMs in UAV scenarios. We hope MM-UAVBench will foster future research on robust and reliable MLLMs for real-world UAV intelligence.

*Jiaxu Zhang,Tianshu Hu,Yuan Zhang,Zenan Li,Linjie Luo,Guosheng Lin,Xin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniMAGE is a unified director model that combines script drafting and key-shot design in a single framework, enabling non-experts to create long-context, multi-shot films by bridging user prompts with structured scripts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI video creation systems treat script drafting (using LLMs) and key-shot design (using image generation models) as separate disjoint tasks, but these should be unified since logical reasoning and imaginative thinking are both essential qualities of a film director.

Method: Uses Mixture-of-Transformers architecture to unify text and image generation. Introduces "first interleaving, then disentangling" training paradigm: 1) Interleaved Concept Learning with text-image data for script understanding, 2) Disentangled Expert Learning to decouple script writing from keyframe generation for flexibility.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models, generating logically coherent video scripts and visually consistent keyframe images.

Conclusion: UniMAGE successfully bridges user prompts with well-structured scripts, empowering non-experts to produce long-context, multi-shot films by unifying script drafting and key-shot design in a single director model framework.

Abstract: Existing AI-driven video creation systems typically treat script drafting and key-shot design as two disjoint tasks: the former relies on large language models, while the latter depends on image generation models. We argue that these two tasks should be unified within a single framework, as logical reasoning and imaginative thinking are both fundamental qualities of a film director. In this work, we propose UniMAGE, a unified director model that bridges user prompts with well-structured scripts, thereby empowering non-experts to produce long-context, multi-shot films by leveraging existing audio-video generation models. To achieve this, we employ the Mixture-of-Transformers architecture that unifies text and image generation. To further enhance narrative logic and keyframe consistency, we introduce a ``first interleaving, then disentangling'' training paradigm. Specifically, we first perform Interleaved Concept Learning, which utilizes interleaved text-image data to foster the model's deeper understanding and imaginative interpretation of scripts. We then conduct Disentangled Expert Learning, which decouples script writing from keyframe generation, enabling greater flexibility and creativity in storytelling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniMAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models, generating logically coherent video scripts and visually consistent keyframe images.

*Minwoo Kim,Hongki Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SGPS uses SURE gradient updates and PCA noise estimation to correct diffusion sampling errors, enabling high-quality inverse problem reconstruction with <100 NFEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based inverse problem solvers require hundreds/thousands of steps due to error accumulation from alternating diffusion sampling and data consistency steps.

Method: SURE Guided Posterior Sampling (SGPS) corrects sampling trajectory deviations using Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE) gradient updates and PCA-based noise estimation to mitigate noise-induced errors.

Result: SGPS maintains high reconstruction quality with fewer than 100 Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs) and consistently outperforms existing methods at low NFE counts across diverse inverse problems.

Conclusion: SGPS enables more accurate posterior sampling with reduced error accumulation, making diffusion models more practical for inverse problems by significantly reducing computational requirements.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful learned priors for solving inverse problems. However, current iterative solving approaches which alternate between diffusion sampling and data consistency steps typically require hundreds or thousands of steps to achieve high quality reconstruction due to accumulated errors. We address this challenge with SURE Guided Posterior Sampling (SGPS), a method that corrects sampling trajectory deviations using Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE) gradient updates and PCA based noise estimation. By mitigating noise induced errors during the critical early and middle sampling stages, SGPS enables more accurate posterior sampling and reduces error accumulation. This allows our method to maintain high reconstruction quality with fewer than 100 Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs). Our extensive evaluation across diverse inverse problems demonstrates that SGPS consistently outperforms existing methods at low NFE counts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a training-free, two-stage data pruning method for RS diffusion foundation models that selects high-quality subsets under high pruning ratios (up to 85%) to improve training efficiency and model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RS diffusion foundation models rely on large datasets with redundancy, noise, and class imbalance, which reduce training efficiency and prevent convergence. Current approaches use simplistic deduplication or aggregate multiple datasets without considering generation modeling requirements and RS imagery heterogeneity.

Method: Two-stage data pruning approach: 1) Entropy-based criterion removes low-information samples, 2) Scene-aware clustering with stratified sampling using RS scene classification datasets as reference benchmarks, balancing cluster-level uniformity and sample representativeness for fine-grained selection under high pruning ratios.

Result: Method significantly improves convergence and generation quality even after pruning 85% of training data. Diffusion foundation models trained with this approach achieve state-of-the-art performance across downstream tasks including super-resolution and semantic image synthesis.

Conclusion: The proposed data pruning paradigm provides practical guidance for developing RS generative foundation models by enabling efficient training with high-quality subsets while preserving diversity and representativeness, making models versatile backbones for various applications.

Abstract: Diffusion-based remote sensing (RS) generative foundation models are cruial for downstream tasks. However, these models rely on large amounts of globally representative data, which often contain redundancy, noise, and class imbalance, reducing training efficiency and preventing convergence. Existing RS diffusion foundation models typically aggregate multiple classification datasets or apply simplistic deduplication, overlooking the distributional requirements of generation modeling and the heterogeneity of RS imagery. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free, two-stage data pruning approach that quickly select a high-quality subset under high pruning ratios, enabling a preliminary foundation model to converge rapidly and serve as a versatile backbone for generation, downstream fine-tuning, and other applications. Our method jointly considers local information content with global scene-level diversity and representativeness. First, an entropy-based criterion efficiently removes low-information samples. Next, leveraging RS scene classification datasets as reference benchmarks, we perform scene-aware clustering with stratified sampling to improve clustering effectiveness while reducing computational costs on large-scale unlabeled data. Finally, by balancing cluster-level uniformity and sample representativeness, the method enables fine-grained selection under high pruning ratios while preserving overall diversity and representativeness. Experiments show that, even after pruning 85\% of the training data, our method significantly improves convergence and generation quality. Furthermore, diffusion foundation models trained with our method consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance across downstream tasks, including super-resolution and semantic image synthesis. This data pruning paradigm offers practical guidance for developing RS generative foundation models.

*Siyu Zhang,Ying Chen,Lianlei Shan,Runhe Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a VLM framework with Dynamic Resolution Input Strategy and Multi-scale Vision-language Alignment Mechanism for multimodal remote sensing fusion, improving accuracy and efficiency in image captioning and cross-modal retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of single-source remote sensing data and address deficiencies in existing methods: fixed resolutions failing to balance efficiency/detail, and lack of semantic hierarchy in single-scale alignment.

Method: Vision-language Model framework with two innovations: 1) Dynamic Resolution Input Strategy (DRIS) using coarse-to-fine approach to adaptively allocate computational resources; 2) Multi-scale Vision-language Alignment Mechanism (MS-VLAM) with three-tier alignment (object, local-region, global levels) to capture cross-modal semantic consistency.

Result: Significant improvements in semantic understanding accuracy and computational efficiency on RS-GPT4V dataset. Superior performance in BLEU-4 and CIDEr for image captioning, and R@10 for cross-modal retrieval compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: Provides novel approach for efficient and robust multimodal remote sensing systems, laying theoretical foundation and technical guidance for intelligent remote sensing interpretation engineering applications.

Abstract: Multimodal fusion of remote sensing images serves as a core technology for overcoming the limitations of single-source data and improving the accuracy of surface information extraction, which exhibits significant application value in fields such as environmental monitoring and urban planning. To address the deficiencies of existing methods, including the failure of fixed resolutions to balance efficiency and detail, as well as the lack of semantic hierarchy in single-scale alignment, this study proposes a Vision-language Model (VLM) framework integrated with two key innovations: the Dynamic Resolution Input Strategy (DRIS) and the Multi-scale Vision-language Alignment Mechanism (MS-VLAM).Specifically, the DRIS adopts a coarse-to-fine approach to adaptively allocate computational resources according to the complexity of image content, thereby preserving key fine-grained features while reducing redundant computational overhead. The MS-VLAM constructs a three-tier alignment mechanism covering object, local-region and global levels, which systematically captures cross-modal semantic consistency and alleviates issues of semantic misalignment and granularity imbalance.Experimental results on the RS-GPT4V dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the accuracy of semantic understanding and computational efficiency in tasks including image captioning and cross-modal retrieval. Compared with conventional methods, it achieves superior performance in evaluation metrics such as BLEU-4 and CIDEr for image captioning, as well as R@10 for cross-modal retrieval. This technical framework provides a novel approach for constructing efficient and robust multimodal remote sensing systems, laying a theoretical foundation and offering technical guidance for the engineering application of intelligent remote sensing interpretation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASemconsist is a novel framework for generating character-consistent image sequences using selective text embedding modification, padding embedding repurposing, adaptive feature-sharing, and a unified evaluation metric (CQS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image diffusion models struggle to maintain consistent character identity across diverse scene descriptions while preserving per-image prompt alignment, creating a trade-off between identity consistency and prompt fidelity.

Method: 1) Selective text embedding modification for explicit semantic control over character identity; 2) Repurposing padding embeddings in FLUX as semantic containers; 3) Adaptive feature-sharing that evaluates textual ambiguity and applies constraints only to ambiguous identity prompts.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively overcoming prior trade-offs between identity consistency and per-image prompt alignment.

Conclusion: ASemconsist provides an effective solution for character-consistent image sequence generation through novel semantic control strategies and a comprehensive evaluation metric that captures performance imbalances.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image diffusion models have significantly improved visual quality and text alignment. However, generating a sequence of images while preserving consistent character identity across diverse scene descriptions remains a challenging task. Existing methods often struggle with a trade-off between maintaining identity consistency and ensuring per-image prompt alignment. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, ASemconsist, that addresses this challenge through selective text embedding modification, enabling explicit semantic control over character identity without sacrificing prompt alignment. Furthermore, based on our analysis of padding embeddings in FLUX, we propose a semantic control strategy that repurposes padding embeddings as semantic containers. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive feature-sharing strategy that automatically evaluates textual ambiguity and applies constraints only to the ambiguous identity prompt. Finally, we propose a unified evaluation protocol, the Consistency Quality Score (CQS), which integrates identity preservation and per-image text alignment into a single comprehensive metric, explicitly capturing performance imbalances between the two metrics. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively overcoming prior trade-offs. Project page: https://minjung-s.github.io/asemconsist

*Masaya Takabe,Hiroshi Watanabe,Sujun Hong,Tomohiro Ikai,Zheming Fan,Ryo Ishimoto,Kakeru Sugimoto,Ruri Imichi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A contour-aware 2D Gaussian Splatting framework that uses object segmentation priors to preserve edge structures and prevent cross-boundary blending, especially effective with few Gaussians.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 2D Gaussian Splatting methods produce blurry boundaries when using few Gaussians due to lack of contour awareness, limiting their effectiveness in high compression scenarios.

Method: Proposes Contour Information-Aware 2D Gaussian Splatting that incorporates object segmentation priors to constrain each Gaussian to specific segmentation regions during rasterization, preventing cross-boundary blending. Also introduces a warm-up scheme to stabilize training.

Result: Achieves higher reconstruction quality around object edges compared to existing 2DGS methods, particularly evident with very few Gaussians, while maintaining fast rendering and low memory usage.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the boundary blurring problem in 2D Gaussian Splatting by incorporating contour awareness through segmentation priors, enabling better edge preservation under high compression.

Abstract: Image representation is a fundamental task in computer vision. Recently, Gaussian Splatting has emerged as an efficient representation framework, and its extension to 2D image representation enables lightweight, yet expressive modeling of visual content. While recent 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) approaches provide compact storage and real-time decoding, they often produce blurry or indistinct boundaries when the number of Gaussians is small due to the lack of contour awareness. In this work, we propose a Contour Information-Aware 2D Gaussian Splatting framework that incorporates object segmentation priors into Gaussian-based image representation. By constraining each Gaussian to a specific segmentation region during rasterization, our method prevents cross-boundary blending and preserves edge structures under high compression. We also introduce a warm-up scheme to stabilize training and improve convergence. Experiments on synthetic color charts and the DAVIS dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves higher reconstruction quality around object edges compared to existing 2DGS methods. The improvement is particularly evident in scenarios with very few Gaussians, while our method still maintains fast rendering and low memory usage.

*Tong Shao,Yusen Fu,Guoying Sun,Jingde Kong,Zhuotao Tian,Jingyong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CEM is a fidelity-optimization plugin that minimizes cumulative error in diffusion transformer acceleration through dynamic caching strategy optimization, improving generation quality without extra computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have slow inference due to iterative denoising, and existing caching-based acceleration methods suffer from computational errors that fixed caching strategies can't adapt to complex error variations.

Method: Proposes CEM plugin that predefines error sensitivity based on timesteps and cache intervals, then uses dynamic programming with cumulative error approximation to optimize caching strategies for error minimization.

Result: CEM significantly improves generation fidelity across 9 models and quantized methods in 3 tasks, outperforming original performance on FLUX.1-dev, PixArt-α, StableDiffusion1.5 and Hunyuan.

Conclusion: CEM is a model-agnostic, training-free plugin that optimizes caching strategies to minimize cumulative error, enhancing diffusion transformer acceleration fidelity without additional computational overhead.

Abstract: Although Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has emerged as a predominant architecture for image and video generation, its iterative denoising process results in slow inference, which hinders broader applicability and development. Caching-based methods achieve training-free acceleration, while suffering from considerable computational error. Existing methods typically incorporate error correction strategies such as pruning or prediction to mitigate it. However, their fixed caching strategy fails to adapt to the complex error variations during denoising, which limits the full potential of error correction. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel fidelity-optimization plugin for existing error correction methods via cumulative error minimization, named CEM. CEM predefines the error to characterize the sensitivity of model to acceleration jointly influenced by timesteps and cache intervals. Guided by this prior, we formulate a dynamic programming algorithm with cumulative error approximation for strategy optimization, which achieves the caching error minimization, resulting in a substantial improvement in generation fidelity. CEM is model-agnostic and exhibits strong generalization, which is adaptable to arbitrary acceleration budgets. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing error correction frameworks and quantized models without introducing any additional computational overhead. Extensive experiments conducted on nine generation models and quantized methods across three tasks demonstrate that CEM significantly improves generation fidelity of existing acceleration models, and outperforms the original generation performance on FLUX.1-dev, PixArt-$α$, StableDiffusion1.5 and Hunyuan. The code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: YOLO-Master introduces instance-conditional adaptive computation for real-time object detection using Efficient Sparse Mixture-of-Experts blocks to dynamically allocate resources based on scene complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing YOLO-like RTOD models use static dense computation that applies uniform processing to all inputs, causing computational redundancy and suboptimal performance by over-allocating resources to trivial scenes while under-serving complex ones.

Method: Proposes YOLO-Master framework with Efficient Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (ES-MoE) blocks that dynamically allocate computational resources per input based on scene complexity. Uses lightweight dynamic routing network with diversity-enhancing objective to encourage complementary expertise among experts, activating only relevant experts during inference.

Result: Achieves 42.4% AP with 1.62ms latency on MS COCO, outperforming YOLOv13-N by +0.8% mAP with 17.8% faster inference. Gains are most pronounced on challenging dense scenes while maintaining efficiency on typical inputs and real-time speed.

Conclusion: YOLO-Master successfully addresses computational inefficiency in RTOD through adaptive computation, demonstrating superior performance and speed across five large-scale benchmarks while maintaining real-time inference capabilities.

Abstract: Existing Real-Time Object Detection (RTOD) methods commonly adopt YOLO-like architectures for their favorable trade-off between accuracy and speed. However, these models rely on static dense computation that applies uniform processing to all inputs, misallocating representational capacity and computational resources such as over-allocating on trivial scenes while under-serving complex ones. This mismatch results in both computational redundancy and suboptimal detection performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose YOLO-Master, a novel YOLO-like framework that introduces instance-conditional adaptive computation for RTOD. This is achieved through a Efficient Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (ES-MoE) block that dynamically allocates computational resources to each input according to its scene complexity. At its core, a lightweight dynamic routing network guides expert specialization during training through a diversity enhancing objective, encouraging complementary expertise among experts. Additionally, the routing network adaptively learns to activate only the most relevant experts, thereby improving detection performance while minimizing computational overhead during inference. Comprehensive experiments on five large-scale benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of YOLO-Master. On MS COCO, our model achieves 42.4% AP with 1.62ms latency, outperforming YOLOv13-N by +0.8% mAP and 17.8% faster inference. Notably, the gains are most pronounced on challenging dense scenes, while the model preserves efficiency on typical inputs and maintains real-time inference speed. Code will be available.

TL;DR: Multimodal frameworks for micro-gesture recognition and behavior-based emotion prediction using RGB video and skeletal pose data, achieving 2nd place in MiGA 2025 Challenge emotion prediction task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Micro-gesture recognition and behavior-based emotion prediction are challenging tasks requiring modeling of subtle, fine-grained human behaviors from video and skeletal pose data, particularly on the iMiGUE dataset.

Method: Two multimodal frameworks: 1) For micro-gesture classification, uses MViTv2-S for video embeddings and 2s-AGCN for skeletal embeddings, fused via Cross-Modal Token Fusion; 2) For emotion recognition, uses SwinFace for facial embeddings and MViTv2-S for contextual embeddings, fused via InterFusion module.

Result: Demonstrated robust performance on iMiGUE dataset, achieving 2nd place in the behavior-based emotion prediction task of the MiGA 2025 Challenge.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal frameworks effectively capture complementary information from different modalities (RGB video, skeletal pose, facial features) for fine-grained behavior analysis, showing strong performance in challenging micro-gesture and emotion recognition tasks.

Abstract: Micro-gesture recognition and behavior-based emotion prediction are both highly challenging tasks that require modeling subtle, fine-grained human behaviors, primarily leveraging video and skeletal pose data. In this work, we present two multimodal frameworks designed to tackle both problems on the iMiGUE dataset. For micro-gesture classification, we explore the complementary strengths of RGB and 3D pose-based representations to capture nuanced spatio-temporal patterns. To comprehensively represent gestures, video, and skeletal embeddings are extracted using MViTv2-S and 2s-AGCN, respectively. Then, they are integrated through a Cross-Modal Token Fusion module to combine spatial and pose information. For emotion recognition, our framework extends to behavior-based emotion prediction, a binary classification task identifying emotional states based on visual cues. We leverage facial and contextual embeddings extracted using SwinFace and MViTv2-S models and fuse them through an InterFusion module designed to capture emotional expressions and body gestures. Experiments conducted on the iMiGUE dataset, within the scope of the MiGA 2025 Challenge, demonstrate the robust performance and accuracy of our method in the behavior-based emotion prediction task, where our approach secured 2nd place.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CAD modeling is complex and hard to automate. Existing sketch-to-3D methods produce non-editable, approximate models that don't meet industrial precision requirements, and often require manual annotation.

Method: Heterogeneous Collaborative Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning (CME-CAD) with two-stage training: Multi-Expert Fine-Tuning (MEFT) and Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning (MERL). Also introduces CADExpert benchmark with 17,299 instances including orthographic projections, CoT processes, CADQuery code, and 3D models.

Result: The approach generates accurate, constraint-compatible, and fully editable CAD models by integrating complementary strengths of multiple models through collaborative learning.

Conclusion: CME-CAD addresses limitations of existing methods by providing a scalable solution for automated CAD generation that meets industrial precision and editability requirements.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is essential in industrial design, but the complexity of traditional CAD modeling and workflows presents significant challenges for automating the generation of high-precision, editable CAD models. Existing methods that reconstruct 3D models from sketches often produce non-editable and approximate models that fall short of meeting the stringent requirements for precision and editability in industrial design. Moreover, the reliance on text or image-based inputs often requires significant manual annotation, limiting their scalability and applicability in industrial settings. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Heterogeneous Collaborative Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning (CME-CAD) paradigm, a novel training paradigm for CAD code generation. Our approach integrates the complementary strengths of these models, facilitating collaborative learning and improving the model's ability to generate accurate, constraint-compatible, and fully editable CAD models. We introduce a two-stage training process: Multi-Expert Fine-Tuning (MEFT), and Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning (MERL). Additionally, we present CADExpert, an open-source benchmark consisting of 17,299 instances, including orthographic projections with precise dimension annotations, expert-generated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes, executable CADQuery code, and rendered 3D models.

### [147] [Visual Language Hypothesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23335)
*Xiu Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Visual representation learning requires fiber bundle structure where semantics form quotient space, needing discriminative targets and architectural mechanisms for topology change.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand visual representation learning from structural/topological perspective, starting from hypothesis that visual understanding requires semantic language where many perceptual observations map to few discrete semantic states.

Method: Theoretical analysis using fiber bundle structure: visual observation space organized as fiber bundle (nuisance variation in fibers, semantics in quotient base space). Derives consequences about semantic quotient requiring non-homeomorphic discriminative targets and architectural mechanisms for topology change.

Result: Two key theoretical findings: 1) Semantic quotient cannot be obtained through smooth deformation alone, requires discriminative targets (labels, cross-instance identification, multimodal alignment). 2) Approximating quotient requires architectural mechanisms supporting topology change via "expand-and-snap" process (geometric expansion then collapse).

Conclusion: Framework provides topological lens aligning with empirical regularities in large-scale discriminative/multimodal models and classical statistical learning principles, emphasizing interpretive rather than prescriptive nature of results.

Abstract: We study visual representation learning from a structural and topological perspective. We begin from a single hypothesis: that visual understanding presupposes a semantic language for vision, in which many perceptual observations correspond to a small number of discrete semantic states. Together with widely assumed premises on transferability and abstraction in representation learning, this hypothesis implies that the visual observation space must be organized in a fiber bundle like structure, where nuisance variation populates fibers and semantics correspond to a quotient base space. From this structure we derive two theoretical consequences. First, the semantic quotient $X/G$ is not a submanifold of $X$ and cannot be obtained through smooth deformation alone, semantic invariance requires a non-homeomorphic, discriminative target, for example, supervision via labels, cross instance identification, or multimodal alignment that supplies explicit semantic equivalence. Second, we show that approximating the quotient also places structural demands on the model architecture. Semantic abstraction requires not only an external semantic target, but a representation mechanism capable of supporting topology change: an expand-and-snap process in which the manifold is first geometrically expanded to separate structure and then collapsed to form discrete semantic regions. We emphasize that these results are interpretive rather than prescriptive: the framework provides a topological lens that aligns with empirical regularities observed in large-scale discriminative and multimodal models, and with classical principles in statistical learning theory.

*Niki Amini-Naieni,Andrew Zisserman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CountGD++ introduces novel prompt capabilities for object counting, including specifying what NOT to count, pseudo-exemplars for automatic annotation, and support for both natural/synthetic visual examples, improving flexibility and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing object counting methods have limitations in how target objects can be specified - they require manual annotation of visual examples, lack ability to specify what not to count, and have limited flexibility in prompt design.

Method: Extends counting prompts to include negative specifications (what not to count), introduces pseudo-exemplars for automatic annotation at inference, supports visual examples from both natural and synthetic external images, and integrates as vision expert agent for LLMs.

Result: Significant improvements in accuracy, efficiency, and generalization across multiple datasets, with expanded prompt flexibility for multi-modal open-world counting.

Conclusion: CountGD++ addresses key limitations in object counting specification, providing more flexible prompting capabilities that enable better control over counting tasks and improved performance across various scenarios.

Abstract: The flexibility and accuracy of methods for automatically counting objects in images and videos are limited by the way the object can be specified. While existing methods allow users to describe the target object with text and visual examples, the visual examples must be manually annotated inside the image, and there is no way to specify what not to count. To address these gaps, we introduce novel capabilities that expand how the target object can be specified. Specifically, we extend the prompt to enable what not to count to be described with text and/or visual examples, introduce the concept of `pseudo-exemplars' that automate the annotation of visual examples at inference, and extend counting models to accept visual examples from both natural and synthetic external images. We also use our new counting model, CountGD++, as a vision expert agent for an LLM. Together, these contributions expand the prompt flexibility of multi-modal open-world counting and lead to significant improvements in accuracy, efficiency, and generalization across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The SpatialMosaic framework addresses key limitations in current 3D scene understanding approaches by enabling robust spatial reasoning from multi-view images without explicit 3D reconstructions, handling real-world challenges like occlusion and partial visibility through comprehensive data generation and hybrid model architecture.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked the potential for enhanced 3D scene understanding and spatial reasoning. However, existing approaches often rely on pre-constructed 3D representations or off-the-shelf reconstruction pipelines, which constrain scalability and real-world applicability. A recent line of work explores learning spatial reasoning directly from multi-view images, enabling Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to understand 3D scenes without explicit 3D reconstructions. Nevertheless, key challenges that frequently arise in real-world environments, such as partial visibility, occlusion, and low-overlap conditions that require spatial reasoning from fragmented visual cues, remain under-explored. To address these limitations, we propose a scalable multi-view data generation and annotation pipeline that constructs realistic spatial reasoning QAs, resulting in SpatialMosaic, a comprehensive instruction-tuning dataset featuring 2M QA pairs. We further introduce SpatialMosaic-Bench, a challenging benchmark for evaluating multi-view spatial reasoning under realistic and challenging scenarios, consisting of 1M QA pairs across 6 tasks. In addition, we present SpatialMosaicVLM, a hybrid framework that integrates 3D reconstruction models as geometry encoders within VLMs for robust spatial reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed dataset and VQA tasks effectively enhance spatial reasoning under challenging multi-view conditions, validating the effectiveness of our data generation pipeline in constructing realistic and diverse QA pairs. Code and dataset will be available soon.

*Shuyuan Lin,Mengtin Lo,Haosheng Chen,Yanjie Liang,Qiangqiang Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MGCA-Net improves two-view correspondence learning with geometric attention and cross-stage consensus modules, outperforming SOTA methods on outlier rejection and camera pose estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing two-view correspondence learning methods have limitations in local geometric modeling and cross-stage information optimization, reducing robustness in capturing geometric constraints for applications like camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction.

Method: Proposes Multi-Graph Contextual Attention Network (MGCA-Net) with two modules: Contextual Geometric Attention (CGA) that dynamically integrates spatial position and feature information via adaptive attention, and Cross-Stage Multi-Graph Consensus (CSMGC) that establishes geometric consensus via cross-stage sparse graph network.

Result: Experimental results on YFCC100M and SUN3D datasets show MGCA-Net significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods in outlier rejection and camera pose estimation tasks.

Conclusion: MGCA-Net effectively addresses limitations in geometric modeling and cross-stage optimization, improving robustness in two-view correspondence learning for computer vision applications.

Abstract: Two-view correspondence learning is a key task in computer vision, which aims to establish reliable matching relationships for applications such as camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. However, existing methods have limitations in local geometric modeling and cross-stage information optimization, which make it difficult to accurately capture the geometric constraints of matched pairs and thus reduce the robustness of the model. To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-Graph Contextual Attention Network (MGCA-Net), which consists of a Contextual Geometric Attention (CGA) module and a Cross-Stage Multi-Graph Consensus (CSMGC) module. Specifically, CGA dynamically integrates spatial position and feature information via an adaptive attention mechanism and enhances the capability to capture both local and global geometric relationships. Meanwhile, CSMGC establishes geometric consensus via a cross-stage sparse graph network, ensuring the consistency of geometric information across different stages. Experimental results on two representative YFCC100M and SUN3D datasets show that MGCA-Net significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods in the outlier rejection and camera pose estimation tasks.

*Yifei Li,Haoyuan He,Yu Zheng,Bingyao Yu,Wenzhao Zheng,Lei Chen,Jie Zhou,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeXT-IMDL is a diagnostic benchmark that exposes the fragility of current image manipulation detection models by systematically testing their generalization across four key dimensions of AI-generated content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image manipulation detection methods appear to perform well in cross-dataset evaluations, but this creates a misleading impression of progress. The surge in accessible image editing tools and their abuse risks requires truly robust detection methods that can handle diverse real-world scenarios.

Method: Created NeXT-IMDL benchmark that categorizes AI-generated content manipulations along four axes: editing models, manipulation types, content semantics, and forgery granularity. Implemented five rigorous cross-dimension evaluation protocols to systematically probe generalization boundaries.

Result: Testing 11 representative models revealed systemic failures and significant performance degradation when evaluated under protocols simulating real-world generalization scenarios, despite their good performance in original settings.

Conclusion: Current IMDL models are fragile and lack true robustness. NeXT-IMDL provides a diagnostic toolkit to advance development toward next-generation, truly robust image manipulation detection systems.

Abstract: The accessibility surge and abuse risks of user-friendly image editing models have created an urgent need for generalizable, up-to-date methods for Image Manipulation Detection and Localization (IMDL). Current IMDL research typically uses cross-dataset evaluation, where models trained on one benchmark are tested on others. However, this simplified evaluation approach conceals the fragility of existing methods when handling diverse AI-generated content, leading to misleading impressions of progress. This paper challenges this illusion by proposing NeXT-IMDL, a large-scale diagnostic benchmark designed not just to collect data, but to probe the generalization boundaries of current detectors systematically. Specifically, NeXT-IMDL categorizes AIGC-based manipulations along four fundamental axes: editing models, manipulation types, content semantics, and forgery granularity. Built upon this, NeXT-IMDL implements five rigorous cross-dimension evaluation protocols. Our extensive experiments on 11 representative models reveal a critical insight: while these models perform well in their original settings, they exhibit systemic failures and significant performance degradation when evaluated under our designed protocols that simulate real-world, various generalization scenarios. By providing this diagnostic toolkit and the new findings, we aim to advance the development towards building truly robust, next-generation IMDL models.

*Xiaolan Li,Wanquan Liu,Pengcheng Li,Pengyu Jie,Chenqiang Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SOFTooth: A 2D-3D fusion framework for 3D tooth instance segmentation that leverages frozen 2D SAM embeddings without 2D mask supervision, achieving SOTA results on challenging cases like third molars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D tooth instance segmentation faces challenges like crowded arches, ambiguous boundaries, missing teeth, and rare third molars. Native 3D methods suffer from boundary leakage and center drift, while 2D foundation models like SAM aren't practical for 3D clinical workflows.

Method: SOFTooth uses a semantics-enhanced, order-aware 2D-3D fusion framework: 1) Point-wise residual gating injects occlusal-view SAM embeddings into 3D point features to refine boundaries, 2) Center-guided mask refinement regularizes consistency between masks and centroids, 3) Order-aware Hungarian matching integrates anatomical tooth order and center distance for coherent labeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art overall accuracy and mean IoU on 3DTeethSeg'22 dataset, with clear gains on cases involving third molars, demonstrating effective transfer of 2D semantics to 3D segmentation without 2D fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Rich 2D semantics from foundation models like SAM can be effectively transferred to 3D tooth instance segmentation without explicit 2D mask supervision, addressing key challenges in dental segmentation workflows.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) tooth instance segmentation remains challenging due to crowded arches, ambiguous tooth-gingiva boundaries, missing teeth, and rare yet clinically important third molars. Native 3D methods relying on geometric cues often suffer from boundary leakage, center drift, and inconsistent tooth identities, especially for minority classes and complex anatomies. Meanwhile, 2D foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) provide strong boundary-aware semantics, but directly applying them in 3D is impractical in clinical workflows. To address these issues, we propose SOFTooth, a semantics-enhanced, order-aware 2D-3D fusion framework that leverages frozen 2D semantics without explicit 2D mask supervision. First, a point-wise residual gating module injects occlusal-view SAM embeddings into 3D point features to refine tooth-gingiva and inter-tooth boundaries. Second, a center-guided mask refinement regularizes consistency between instance masks and geometric centroids, reducing center drift. Furthermore, an order-aware Hungarian matching strategy integrates anatomical tooth order and center distance into similarity-based assignment, ensuring coherent labeling even under missing or crowded dentitions. On 3DTeethSeg'22, SOFTooth achieves state-of-the-art overall accuracy and mean IoU, with clear gains on cases involving third molars, demonstrating that rich 2D semantics can be effectively transferred to 3D tooth instance segmentation without 2D fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArtQuant framework with RAD dataset achieves SOTA aesthetic assessment using LLM decoders and joint description generation, reducing training time by 67%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aesthetic quality assessment is crucial for human-aligned AIGC evaluation, but faces challenges: (1) data scarcity/imbalance in existing datasets focusing only on visual perception, and (2) model fragmentation where current methods isolate aesthetic attributes or struggle with long-form descriptions.

Method: Proposes ArtQuant framework with two components: (1) RAD dataset - large-scale (70k) multi-dimensional structured dataset generated via iterative pipeline without heavy annotation, and (2) LLM-based framework that couples aesthetic dimensions through joint description generation and better models long-text semantics using LLM decoders.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on several datasets while requiring only 33% of conventional training epochs (67% reduction). Theoretical analysis confirms RAD's semantic adequacy and generation paradigm collectively minimize prediction entropy.

Conclusion: The approach narrows the cognitive gap between artistic images and aesthetic judgment, providing a scalable solution for aesthetic assessment with both code and dataset to be released for future research.

Abstract: The aesthetic quality assessment task is crucial for developing a human-aligned quantitative evaluation system for AIGC. However, its inherently complex nature, spanning visual perception, cognition, and emotion, poses fundamental challenges. Although aesthetic descriptions offer a viable representation of this complexity, two critical challenges persist: (1) data scarcity and imbalance: existing dataset overly focuses on visual perception and neglects deeper dimensions due to the expensive manual annotation; and (2) model fragmentation: current visual networks isolate aesthetic attributes with multi-branch encoder, while multimodal methods represented by contrastive learning struggle to effectively process long-form textual descriptions. To resolve challenge (1), we first present the Refined Aesthetic Description (RAD) dataset, a large-scale (70k), multi-dimensional structured dataset, generated via an iterative pipeline without heavy annotation costs and easy to scale. To address challenge (2), we propose ArtQuant, an aesthetics assessment framework for artistic images which not only couples isolated aesthetic dimensions through joint description generation, but also better models long-text semantics with the help of LLM decoders. Besides, theoretical analysis confirms this symbiosis: RAD's semantic adequacy (data) and generation paradigm (model) collectively minimize prediction entropy, providing mathematical grounding for the framework. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several datasets while requiring only 33% of conventional training epochs, narrowing the cognitive gap between artistic images and aesthetic judgment. We will release both code and dataset to support future research.

TL;DR: DriveLaW unifies video generation and motion planning for autonomous driving by directly injecting video generator latents into the planner, achieving state-of-the-art results in both tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current world models for autonomous driving keep world prediction and motion planning as decoupled processes, limiting their effectiveness. The authors aim to bridge this gap by creating a truly unified architecture.

Method: DriveLaW consists of two components: DriveLaW-Video (world model for high-fidelity forecasting) and DriveLaW-Act (diffusion planner that generates trajectories from video latents), both optimized through a three-stage progressive training strategy.

Result: DriveLaW achieves new state-of-the-art results: 33.3% improvement in FID and 1.8% in FVD for video prediction, and sets a new record on the NAVSIM planning benchmark.

Conclusion: The unified paradigm of DriveLaW demonstrates that directly coupling video generation and motion planning leads to inherent consistency and superior performance in both world modeling and planning tasks for autonomous driving.

Abstract: World models have become crucial for autonomous driving, as they learn how scenarios evolve over time to address the long-tail challenges of the real world. However, current approaches relegate world models to limited roles: they operate within ostensibly unified architectures that still keep world prediction and motion planning as decoupled processes. To bridge this gap, we propose DriveLaW, a novel paradigm that unifies video generation and motion planning. By directly injecting the latent representation from its video generator into the planner, DriveLaW ensures inherent consistency between high-fidelity future generation and reliable trajectory planning. Specifically, DriveLaW consists of two core components: DriveLaW-Video, our powerful world model that generates high-fidelity forecasting with expressive latent representations, and DriveLaW-Act, a diffusion planner that generates consistent and reliable trajectories from the latent of DriveLaW-Video, with both components optimized by a three-stage progressive training strategy. The power of our unified paradigm is demonstrated by new state-of-the-art results across both tasks. DriveLaW not only advances video prediction significantly, surpassing best-performing work by 33.3% in FID and 1.8% in FVD, but also achieves a new record on the NAVSIM planning benchmark.

*Dohyun Kim,Seungwoo Lyu,Seung Wook Kim,Paul Hongsuck Seo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DDSPO is a new diffusion model training method that uses per-timestep preference supervision from winning/losing policies to improve text-image alignment and visual quality without costly human-labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models struggle with nuanced user intent alignment and consistent aesthetic quality. Existing preference-based methods like DDPO rely on expensive, noisy human-labeled datasets, creating a need for more efficient supervision.

Method: DDSPO directly derives per-timestep supervision from winning and losing policies when available. It avoids labeled data by automatically generating preference signals using a pretrained reference model, contrasting outputs conditioned on original prompts versus semantically degraded variants.

Result: DDSPO improves text-image alignment and visual quality, outperforming or matching existing preference-based methods while requiring significantly less supervision.

Conclusion: DDSPO provides an effective score-space preference supervision approach without explicit reward modeling or manual annotations, offering dense transition-level signals across the denoising trajectory for better diffusion model training.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive results in generative tasks such as text-to-image synthesis, yet they often struggle to fully align outputs with nuanced user intent and maintain consistent aesthetic quality. Existing preference-based training methods like Diffusion Direct Preference Optimization help address these issues but rely on costly and potentially noisy human-labeled datasets. In this work, we introduce Direct Diffusion Score Preference Optimization (DDSPO), which directly derives per-timestep supervision from winning and losing policies when such policies are available. Unlike prior methods that operate solely on final samples, DDSPO provides dense, transition-level signals across the denoising trajectory. In practice, we avoid reliance on labeled data by automatically generating preference signals using a pretrained reference model: we contrast its outputs when conditioned on original prompts versus semantically degraded variants. This practical strategy enables effective score-space preference supervision without explicit reward modeling or manual annotations. Empirical results demonstrate that DDSPO improves text-image alignment and visual quality, outperforming or matching existing preference-based methods while requiring significantly less supervision.

Abstract: Foundation models for segmentation such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) family exhibit strong zero-shot performance, but remain vulnerable in shifted or limited-knowledge domains. This work investigates whether uncertainty quantification can mitigate such challenges and enhance model generalisability in a domain-agnostic manner. To this end, we (1) curate UncertSAM, a benchmark comprising eight datasets designed to stress-test SAM under challenging segmentation conditions including shadows, transparency, and camouflage; (2) evaluate a suite of lightweight, post-hoc uncertainty estimation methods; and (3) assess a preliminary uncertainty-guided prediction refinement step. Among evaluated approaches, a last-layer Laplace approximation yields uncertainty estimates that correlate well with segmentation errors, indicating a meaningful signal. While refinement benefits are preliminary, our findings underscore the potential of incorporating uncertainty into segmentation models to support robust, domain-agnostic performance.

Conclusion: Combining geometric metadata with multimodal AI enables robust water level estimation. Framework offers scalable, efficient solution for automated hydrological monitoring with potential for real-time river gauge digitization.

Abstract: Accurate and continuous monitoring of river water levels is essential for flood forecasting, water resource management, and ecological protection. Traditional hydrological observation methods are often limited by manual measurement errors and environmental constraints. This study presents a hybrid framework integrating vision based waterline detection, YOLOv8 pose scale extraction, and large multimodal language models (GPT 4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash) for automated river gauge plate reading. The methodology involves sequential stages of image preprocessing, annotation, waterline detection, scale gap estimation, and numeric reading extraction. Experiments demonstrate that waterline detection achieved high precision of 94.24 percent and an F1 score of 83.64 percent, while scale gap detection provided accurate geometric calibration for subsequent reading extraction. Incorporating scale gap metadata substantially improved the predictive performance of LLMs, with Gemini Stage 2 achieving the highest accuracy, with a mean absolute error of 5.43 cm, root mean square error of 8.58 cm, and R squared of 0.84 under optimal image conditions. Results highlight the sensitivity of LLMs to image quality, with degraded images producing higher errors, and underscore the importance of combining geometric metadata with multimodal artificial intelligence for robust water level estimation. Overall, the proposed approach offers a scalable, efficient, and reliable solution for automated hydrological monitoring, demonstrating potential for real time river gauge digitization and improved water resource management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for deterministic I2I translation that guarantees consistent, predictable outputs closely matching ground truth with high fidelity, unlike stochastic methods that introduce variance.

Method: Proposes a denoising Brownian bridge model with dual approximators - uses Brownian bridge dynamics with two neural networks (forward and reverse process approximators) to produce faithful outputs with negligible variance.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets for image generation and super-resolution show consistent superior performance in image quality and faithfulness to ground truth compared to both stochastic and deterministic baselines.

Conclusion: Dual-approx Bridge effectively enables deterministic I2I translation with high fidelity and negligible variance, outperforming existing approaches in producing faithful outputs that closely match ground truth.

Abstract: Image-to-Image (I2I) translation involves converting an image from one domain to another. Deterministic I2I translation, such as in image super-resolution, extends this concept by guaranteeing that each input generates a consistent and predictable output, closely matching the ground truth (GT) with high fidelity. In this paper, we propose a denoising Brownian bridge model with dual approximators (Dual-approx Bridge), a novel generative model that exploits the Brownian bridge dynamics and two neural network-based approximators (one for forward and one for reverse process) to produce faithful output with negligible variance and high image quality in I2I translations. Our extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including image generation and super-resolution demonstrate the consistent and superior performance of Dual-approx Bridge in terms of image quality and faithfulness to GT when compared to both stochastic and deterministic baselines.

Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for point cloud registration rely on Euclidean neighborhood-based feature extraction, which struggles to capture implicit semantics and structural consistency in point clouds.

Method: Proposes multi-domain context integration network (MCI-Net) with three key components: 1) graph neighborhood aggregation module for global structural relationships, 2) progressive context interaction module for feature decoupling and inter-domain interaction, and 3) dynamic inlier selection method using residual information from multiple pose estimation iterations.

Result: Extensive experiments on indoor RGB-D and outdoor LiDAR datasets show MCI-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving highest registration recall of 96.4% on 3DMatch benchmark.

Conclusion: MCI-Net effectively improves feature representation and registration performance by integrating contextual information from multiple domains, demonstrating superior robustness and accuracy compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Robust and discriminative feature learning is critical for high-quality point cloud registration. However, existing deep learning-based methods typically rely on Euclidean neighborhood-based strategies for feature extraction, which struggle to effectively capture the implicit semantics and structural consistency in point clouds. To address these issues, we propose a multi-domain context integration network (MCI-Net) that improves feature representation and registration performance by aggregating contextual cues from diverse domains. Specifically, we propose a graph neighborhood aggregation module, which constructs a global graph to capture the overall structural relationships within point clouds. We then propose a progressive context interaction module to enhance feature discriminability by performing intra-domain feature decoupling and inter-domain context interaction. Finally, we design a dynamic inlier selection method that optimizes inlier weights using residual information from multiple iterations of pose estimation, thereby improving the accuracy and robustness of registration. Extensive experiments on indoor RGB-D and outdoor LiDAR datasets show that the proposed MCI-Net significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving the highest registration recall of 96.4\% on 3DMatch.

TL;DR: SC-Net is a novel CNN-based network for two-view correspondence learning that integrates bilateral context from spatial and channel perspectives to address limitations in global context aggregation and motion field oversmoothing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard CNN backbones for two-view correspondence learning often fail to effectively aggregate global context and oversmooth dense motion fields in scenes with large disparity, limiting their performance in challenging scenarios.

Method: Proposes SC-Net with three key modules: 1) Adaptive Focused Regularization (AFR) for position-awareness and robustness against spurious motion, 2) Bilateral Field Adjustment (BFA) for refining motion fields by modeling long-range relationships across spatial/channel dimensions, and 3) Position-Aware Recovery (PAR) for consistent motion vector extraction.

Result: SC-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in relative pose estimation and outlier removal tasks on YFCC100M and SUN3D datasets, demonstrating superior performance in challenging correspondence learning scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed SC-Net effectively addresses limitations of standard CNN backbones by integrating bilateral context from spatial and channel perspectives, leading to improved performance in two-view correspondence learning tasks.

Abstract: Recent research has focused on using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as the backbones in two-view correspondence learning, demonstrating significant superiority over methods based on multilayer perceptrons. However, CNN backbones that are not tailored to specific tasks may fail to effectively aggregate global context and oversmooth dense motion fields in scenes with large disparity. To address these problems, we propose a novel network named SC-Net, which effectively integrates bilateral context from both spatial and channel perspectives. Specifically, we design an adaptive focused regularization module (AFR) to enhance the model's position-awareness and robustness against spurious motion samples, thereby facilitating the generation of a more accurate motion field. We then propose a bilateral field adjustment module (BFA) to refine the motion field by simultaneously modeling long-range relationships and facilitating interaction across spatial and channel dimensions. Finally, we recover the motion vectors from the refined field using a position-aware recovery module (PAR) that ensures consistency and precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SC-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in relative pose estimation and outlier removal tasks on YFCC100M and SUN3D datasets.

*Zongsheng Cao,Yangfan He,Anran Liu,Feng Chen,Zepeng Wang,Jun Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TV-RAG is a training-free architecture that improves long-video reasoning for Large Video Language Models by combining temporal alignment with entropy-guided semantics, outperforming existing baselines on major benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Large Video Language Models struggle with long videos due to narrow temporal windows and inability to detect fine-grained semantic shifts over time. Existing text-based retrieval methods also fail to capture the rich temporal interdependence among visual, audio, and subtitle channels.

Method: TV-RAG introduces two main mechanisms: (1) a time-decay retrieval module that injects explicit temporal offsets into similarity computation to rank text queries by their true multimedia context, and (2) an entropy-weighted key-frame sampler that selects evenly spaced, information-dense frames to reduce redundancy while preserving representativeness.

Result: The system consistently surpasses most leading baselines across established long-video benchmarks including Video-MME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench, confirming its effectiveness.

Conclusion: TV-RAG provides a lightweight, budget-friendly upgrade path that can be grafted onto any LVLM without re-training or fine-tuning, offering improved long-video reasoning through temporal and semantic signal integration.

Abstract: Large Video Language Models (LVLMs) have rapidly emerged as the focus of multimedia AI research. Nonetheless, when confronted with lengthy videos, these models struggle: their temporal windows are narrow, and they fail to notice fine-grained semantic shifts that unfold over extended durations. Moreover, mainstream text-based retrieval pipelines, which rely chiefly on surface-level lexical overlap, ignore the rich temporal interdependence among visual, audio, and subtitle channels. To mitigate these limitations, we propose TV-RAG, a training-free architecture that couples temporal alignment with entropy-guided semantics to improve long-video reasoning. The framework contributes two main mechanisms: \emph{(i)} a time-decay retrieval module that injects explicit temporal offsets into the similarity computation, thereby ranking text queries according to their true multimedia context; and \emph{(ii)} an entropy-weighted key-frame sampler that selects evenly spaced, information-dense frames, reducing redundancy while preserving representativeness. By weaving these temporal and semantic signals together, TV-RAG realises a dual-level reasoning routine that can be grafted onto any LVLM without re-training or fine-tuning. The resulting system offers a lightweight, budget-friendly upgrade path and consistently surpasses most leading baselines across established long-video benchmarks such as Video-MME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench, confirming the effectiveness of our model.

TL;DR: PanCAN: Deep Panoptic Context Aggregation Network that hierarchically integrates multi-order geometric contexts through cross-scale feature aggregation in Hilbert space for improved multi-label image classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current context modeling approaches focus on basic geometric relationships or localized features, neglecting cross-scale contextual interactions between objects, which limits their ability to capture complex scene understanding.

Method: PanCAN learns multi-order neighborhood relationships at each scale by combining random walks with attention mechanism, cascades modules from different scales, selects salient anchors at finer scales, and dynamically fuses neighborhood features via attention in high-dimensional Hilbert space.

Result: Extensive experiments on NUS-WIDE, PASCAL VOC2007, and MS-COCO benchmarks show PanCAN consistently achieves competitive results, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: PanCAN significantly enhances complex scene understanding by combining multi-order and cross-scale context-aware features, substantially improving multi-label classification performance.

Abstract: Context modeling is crucial for visual recognition, enabling highly discriminative image representations by integrating both intrinsic and extrinsic relationships between objects and labels in images. A limitation in current approaches is their focus on basic geometric relationships or localized features, often neglecting cross-scale contextual interactions between objects. This paper introduces the Deep Panoptic Context Aggregation Network (PanCAN), a novel approach that hierarchically integrates multi-order geometric contexts through cross-scale feature aggregation in a high-dimensional Hilbert space. Specifically, PanCAN learns multi-order neighborhood relationships at each scale by combining random walks with an attention mechanism. Modules from different scales are cascaded, where salient anchors at a finer scale are selected and their neighborhood features are dynamically fused via attention. This enables effective cross-scale modeling that significantly enhances complex scene understanding by combining multi-order and cross-scale context-aware features. Extensive multi-label classification experiments on NUS-WIDE, PASCAL VOC2007, and MS-COCO benchmarks demonstrate that PanCAN consistently achieves competitive results, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, thereby substantially improving multi-label classification performance.

Motivation: Existing visual generative models for story generation struggle with maintaining detailed and diverse human face consistency and coordinating multiple characters across different images in human-centric stories.

Method: The framework features two key components: 1) Iterative Identity Discovery to extract cohesive character identities, and 2) Re-denoising Identity Injection to re-denoise images while injecting identities and preserving desired context.

Result: Experiments on the ConsiStory-Human benchmark show that IdentityStory outperforms existing methods, particularly in face consistency, and supports multi-character combinations.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates strong potential for applications such as infinite-length story generation and dynamic character composition in human-centric storytelling.

Abstract: Recent visual generative models enable story generation with consistent characters from text, but human-centric story generation faces additional challenges, such as maintaining detailed and diverse human face consistency and coordinating multiple characters across different images. This paper presents IdentityStory, a framework for human-centric story generation that ensures consistent character identity across multiple sequential images. By taming identity-preserving generators, the framework features two key components: Iterative Identity Discovery, which extracts cohesive character identities, and Re-denoising Identity Injection, which re-denoises images to inject identities while preserving desired context. Experiments on the ConsiStory-Human benchmark demonstrate that IdentityStory outperforms existing methods, particularly in face consistency, and supports multi-character combinations. The framework also shows strong potential for applications such as infinite-length story generation and dynamic character composition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IAFS is a training-free framework that improves diffusion-based image super-resolution by balancing perceptual quality and structural fidelity through iterative refinement and adaptive frequency fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models for image super-resolution struggle to balance high-frequency perceptual quality and low-frequency structural fidelity. Current inference-time scaling methods are suboptimal, with reward-driven optimization causing perceptual over-smoothing and optimal-path search losing structural consistency.

Method: IAFS (Iterative Diffusion Inference-Time Scaling with Adaptive Frequency Steering) uses iterative refinement to correct structural deviations and adaptive frequency fusion to integrate high-frequency perceptual cues with low-frequency structural information, all without requiring additional training.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple diffusion-based SR models show IAFS effectively resolves the perception-fidelity conflict, yielding consistently improved perceptual detail and structural accuracy, outperforming existing inference-time scaling methods.

Conclusion: IAFS provides an effective training-free solution to the perception-fidelity trade-off in diffusion-based image super-resolution through iterative refinement and frequency-aware fusion, achieving better balance between perceptual quality and structural fidelity.

Abstract: Diffusion models have become a leading paradigm for image super-resolution (SR), but existing methods struggle to guarantee both the high-frequency perceptual quality and the low-frequency structural fidelity of generated images. Although inference-time scaling can theoretically improve this trade-off by allocating more computation, existing strategies remain suboptimal: reward-driven particle optimization often causes perceptual over-smoothing, while optimal-path search tends to lose structural consistency. To overcome these difficulties, we propose Iterative Diffusion Inference-Time Scaling with Adaptive Frequency Steering (IAFS), a training-free framework that jointly leverages iterative refinement and frequency-aware particle fusion. IAFS addresses the challenge of balancing perceptual quality and structural fidelity by progressively refining the generated image through iterative correction of structural deviations. Simultaneously, it ensures effective frequency fusion by adaptively integrating high-frequency perceptual cues with low-frequency structural information, allowing for a more accurate and balanced reconstruction across different image details. Extensive experiments across multiple diffusion-based SR models show that IAFS effectively resolves the perception-fidelity conflict, yielding consistently improved perceptual detail and structural accuracy, and outperforming existing inference-time scaling methods.

*Zongsheng Cao,Yangfan He,Anran Liu,Jun Xie,Feng Chen,Zepeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PurifyGen is a training-free, plug-and-play safety method for text-to-image diffusion models that purifies risky prompts through dual-space transformation without modifying model weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety methods for text-to-image generation have significant limitations: text blacklisting is easily circumvented, and harmful content classification requires extensive datasets and retraining. There's a need for more robust, training-free approaches that maintain model integrity.

Method: Dual-stage prompt purification: 1) Compute complementary semantic distance to evaluate token safety by measuring proximity to toxic vs. clean concept embeddings, 2) For risky prompts, apply dual-space transformation: project toxic-aligned embeddings into null space of toxic concepts (removing harmful semantics) while aligning them into range space of clean concepts (reinforcing safe semantics), with token-wise selective replacement of only risky tokens.

Result: Extensive testing shows PurifyGen surpasses current methods in reducing unsafe content across five datasets and competes well with training-dependent approaches, offering strong generalization to unseen prompts and models.

Conclusion: PurifyGen provides an effective, theoretically-grounded, training-free solution for safe text-to-image generation that maintains model weights while achieving robust safety through semantic purification of prompts.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have notably enhanced text-to-image (T2I) generation quality, but they also raise the risk of generating unsafe content. Traditional safety methods like text blacklisting or harmful content classification have significant drawbacks: they can be easily circumvented or require extensive datasets and extra training. To overcome these challenges, we introduce PurifyGen, a novel, training-free approach for safe T2I generation that retains the model's original weights. PurifyGen introduces a dual-stage strategy for prompt purification. First, we evaluate the safety of each token in a prompt by computing its complementary semantic distance, which measures the semantic proximity between the prompt tokens and concept embeddings from predefined toxic and clean lists. This enables fine-grained prompt classification without explicit keyword matching or retraining. Tokens closer to toxic concepts are flagged as risky. Second, for risky prompts, we apply a dual-space transformation: we project toxic-aligned embeddings into the null space of the toxic concept matrix, effectively removing harmful semantic components, and simultaneously align them into the range space of clean concepts. This dual alignment purifies risky prompts by both subtracting unsafe semantics and reinforcing safe ones, while retaining the original intent and coherence. We further define a token-wise strategy to selectively replace only risky token embeddings, ensuring minimal disruption to safe content. PurifyGen offers a plug-and-play solution with theoretical grounding and strong generalization to unseen prompts and models. Extensive testing shows that PurifyGen surpasses current methods in reducing unsafe content across five datasets and competes well with training-dependent approaches.

TL;DR: ThinkGen is a think-driven visual generation framework that leverages MLLM's Chain-of-Thought reasoning for diverse generation tasks using a decoupled MLLM-DiT architecture and separable GRPO training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CoT reasoning in MLLMs is limited to understanding tasks and lacks effective extension to generation tasks, with existing approaches being scenario-specific and lacking generalization capabilities.

Method: ThinkGen uses a decoupled architecture with pretrained MLLM for instruction generation and Diffusion Transformer (DiT) for image production, plus SepGRPO training paradigm that alternates reinforcement learning between modules.

Result: Extensive experiments show ThinkGen achieves robust, state-of-the-art performance across multiple generation benchmarks, demonstrating effective CoT reasoning for diverse generative scenarios.

Conclusion: ThinkGen successfully extends CoT reasoning to generation tasks through a flexible framework that enables joint training across datasets and achieves superior performance in various visual generation scenarios.

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrates that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enables systematic solutions to complex understanding tasks. However, its extension to generation tasks remains nascent and limited by scenario-specific mechanisms that hinder generalization and adaptation. In this work, we present ThinkGen, the first think-driven visual generation framework that explicitly leverages MLLM's CoT reasoning in various generation scenarios. ThinkGen employs a decoupled architecture comprising a pretrained MLLM and a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), wherein the MLLM generates tailored instructions based on user intent, and DiT produces high-quality images guided by these instructions. We further propose a separable GRPO-based training paradigm (SepGRPO), alternating reinforcement learning between the MLLM and DiT modules. This flexible design enables joint training across diverse datasets, facilitating effective CoT reasoning for a wide range of generative scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ThinkGen achieves robust, state-of-the-art performance across multiple generation benchmarks. Code is available: https://github.com/jiaosiyuu/ThinkGen

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the growing demand for efficient image denoising due to proliferation of imaging devices and massive daily image generation, seeking a balance between speed and performance.

Method: Establishes theoretical PCA-Haar transform connection, uses unified tensor SVD projection with Haar transform to capture global/local correlations, includes adaptive noise estimation via eigenvalue analysis, and optionally integrates deep neural networks.

Result: Experimental results on various denoising datasets demonstrate efficient and effective noise removal performance.

Conclusion: Haar-tSVD provides a fast, parallelizable plug-and-play denoiser that balances speed and performance without needing learned local bases, with code publicly available.

Abstract: The proliferation of imaging devices and countless image data generated every day impose an increasingly high demand on efficient and effective image denoising. In this paper, we establish a theoretical connection between principal component analysis (PCA) and the Haar transform under circulant representation, and present a computationally simple denoising algorithm. The proposed method, termed Haar-tSVD, exploits a unified tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) projection combined with Haar transform to efficiently capture global and local patch correlations. Haar-tSVD operates as a one-step, parallelizable plug-and-play denoiser that eliminates the need for learning local bases, thereby striking a balance between denoising speed and performance. Besides, an adaptive noise estimation scheme is introduced to improve robustness according to eigenvalue analysis of the circulant structure. To further enhance the performance under severe noise conditions, we integrate deep neural networks with Haar-tSVD based on the established Haar-PCA relationship. Experimental results on various denoising datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of proposed method for noise removal.

TL;DR: ProGuard is a vision-language proactive guard model that identifies and describes out-of-distribution safety risks in multimodal content without requiring model adjustments, outperforming existing methods on OOD risk detection and description.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defense methods for multimodal safety risks are reactive and require model adjustments, struggling with emerging out-of-distribution safety threats. There's a need for proactive approaches that can identify and describe novel safety risks without modifying existing models.

Method: 1) Construct a modality-balanced dataset of 87K samples with binary safety labels and hierarchical risk categories; 2) Train vision-language base model using reinforcement learning for efficient reasoning; 3) Introduce OOD safety category inference task; 4) Augment RL objective with synonym-bank-based similarity reward to generate concise descriptions for unseen unsafe categories.

Result: ProGuard achieves performance comparable to closed-source large models on binary safety classification, substantially outperforms existing open-source guard models on unsafe content categorization, and improves OOD risk detection by 52.6% and OOD risk description by 64.8%.

Conclusion: ProGuard demonstrates strong proactive moderation capabilities for multimodal safety risks, effectively addressing the limitations of traditional reactive approaches by identifying and describing out-of-distribution threats without requiring model adjustments.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative models has led to a continuous emergence of multimodal safety risks, exposing the limitations of existing defense methods. To address these challenges, we propose ProGuard, a vision-language proactive guard that identifies and describes out-of-distribution (OOD) safety risks without the need for model adjustments required by traditional reactive approaches. We first construct a modality-balanced dataset of 87K samples, each annotated with both binary safety labels and risk categories under a hierarchical multimodal safety taxonomy, effectively mitigating modality bias and ensuring consistent moderation across text, image, and text-image inputs. Based on this dataset, we train our vision-language base model purely through reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve efficient and concise reasoning. To approximate proactive safety scenarios in a controlled setting, we further introduce an OOD safety category inference task and augment the RL objective with a synonym-bank-based similarity reward that encourages the model to generate concise descriptions for unseen unsafe categories. Experimental results show that ProGuard achieves performance comparable to closed-source large models on binary safety classification, substantially outperforms existing open-source guard models on unsafe content categorization. Most notably, ProGuard delivers a strong proactive moderation ability, improving OOD risk detection by 52.6% and OOD risk description by 64.8%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Real-time interactive video diffusion model via improved distillation that enables multimodal (text/image/audio) conditioned avatar generation with 20x faster inference, integrated into LiveTalk system for seamless human-AI interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models for video generation use bidirectional attention and iterative denoising, preventing real-time interaction needed for multimodal AI systems. Existing distillation methods focus on text-to-video and don't handle multimodal conditioning well, leading to unnatural human-AI interaction.

Method: Improved distillation recipe addressing issues in Self Forcing approach, focusing on quality of condition inputs, initialization, and schedule for on-policy optimization. Integrated with audio language models and Anchor-Heavy Identity Sinks technique for long-form video inference.

Result: Distilled model matches visual quality of full-step bidirectional baselines with 20x less inference cost/latency on HDTF, AVSpeech, and CelebV-HQ benchmarks. LiveTalk system outperforms Sora2 and Veo3 in multi-turn coherence and content quality while reducing latency from 1-2 minutes to real-time.

Conclusion: The approach enables real-time multimodal interactive avatar generation, bridging the gap for seamless human-AI interaction through improved distillation techniques and system integration.

Abstract: Real-time video generation via diffusion is essential for building general-purpose multimodal interactive AI systems. However, the simultaneous denoising of all video frames with bidirectional attention via an iterative process in diffusion models prevents real-time interaction. While existing distillation methods can make the model autoregressive and reduce sampling steps to mitigate this, they focus primarily on text-to-video generation, leaving the human-AI interaction unnatural and less efficient. This paper targets real-time interactive video diffusion conditioned on a multimodal context, including text, image, and audio, to bridge the gap. Given the observation that the leading on-policy distillation approach Self Forcing encounters challenges (visual artifacts like flickering, black frames, and quality degradation) with multimodal conditioning, we investigate an improved distillation recipe with emphasis on the quality of condition inputs as well as the initialization and schedule for the on-policy optimization. On benchmarks for multimodal-conditioned (audio, image, and text) avatar video generation including HDTF, AVSpeech, and CelebV-HQ, our distilled model matches the visual quality of the full-step, bidirectional baselines of similar or larger size with 20x less inference cost and latency. Further, we integrate our model with audio language models and long-form video inference technique Anchor-Heavy Identity Sinks to build LiveTalk, a real-time multimodal interactive avatar system. System-level evaluation on our curated multi-turn interaction benchmark shows LiveTalk outperforms state-of-the-art models (Sora2, Veo3) in multi-turn video coherence and content quality, while reducing response latency from 1 to 2 minutes to real-time generation, enabling seamless human-AI multimodal interaction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TWIN is a large-scale image-pair dataset (561K queries) designed to enhance VLMs' fine-grained perceptual abilities by training them to distinguish between visually similar images of the same object.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs are coarse-grained, exhibit visual biases, and miss subtle visual details due to training corpora that emphasize general recognition over fine-grained perception.

Method: Created TWIN dataset of image-pair queries where models must determine if two visually similar images show the same object, spanning diverse everyday objects across contexts, viewpoints, and appearances. Also introduced FGVQA benchmark suite (12K queries) to evaluate fine-grained recognition.

Result: Fine-tuning VLMs on TWIN yields up to 19.3% improvement on the FGVQA benchmark across unseen domains (art, animals, plants, landmarks) without compromising general VQA performance. Dataset scale correlates with performance gains.

Conclusion: TWIN dataset effectively enhances VLMs' perceptual precision for fine-grained recognition and can be integrated as a drop-in addition to existing VLM training corpora to advance future models.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at broad visual understanding but remain coarse-grained, exhibit visual biases, and miss subtle visual details. Existing training corpora reinforce this limitation by emphasizing general recognition ("Is it a cat or a dog?") over fine-grained perception. To address this, we introduce a new training corpus and task designed to enhance the perceptual abilities of VLMs. TWIN is a large-scale dataset of 561,000 image-pair queries that task models to determine whether two visually similar images depict the same object, encouraging attention to nuanced visual cues. The dataset spans a diverse range of everyday objects across contexts, viewpoints, and appearances. Fine-tuning VLMs on TWIN yields notable gains in fine-grained recognition, even on unseen domains such as art, animals, plants, and landmarks. To quantify these gains, we introduce FGVQA, a benchmark suite of 12,000 queries that repurposes fine-grained recognition and retrieval datasets from multiple domains. While existing VLMs struggle on FGVQA, when fine-tuned on TWIN they improve by up to 19.3%, without compromising performance on general VQA benchmarks. Finally, our TWIN dataset scales favorably with object annotations, and our analysis shows that scale is key to performance. We envision TWIN as a drop-in addition to open-source VLM training corpora, advancing perceptual precision of future models. Project webpage: https://glab-caltech.github.io/twin/

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fire detection models struggle with accuracy in infrared night vision, particularly with frequent misclassification of bright artificial lights as fire. Existing methods like YOLOv7, RT-DETR, and YOLOv9 show limitations in dataset construction and false positive reduction.

Method: Three main contributions: 1) Augmented NIR dataset with various data augmentation strategies, 2) Two-stage pipeline combining YOLOv11 for initial detection and EfficientNetV2-B0 for verification to reduce false positives, 3) Patched-YOLO for RGB images using patch-based processing to improve detection of small and distant fire objects.

Conclusion: The paper presents effective solutions for improving fire detection accuracy in both infrared night vision and RGB images, addressing key challenges of false positives from artificial lights and detection of small/distant fire objects through dataset augmentation and novel model architectures.

Abstract: Improving the accuracy of fire detection using infrared night vision cameras remains a challenging task. Previous studies have reported strong performance with popular detection models. For example, YOLOv7 achieved an mAP50-95 of 0.51 using an input image size of 640 x 1280, RT-DETR reached an mAP50-95 of 0.65 with an image size of 640 x 640, and YOLOv9 obtained an mAP50-95 of 0.598 at the same resolution. Despite these results, limitations in dataset construction continue to cause issues, particularly the frequent misclassification of bright artificial lights as fire.
  This report presents three main contributions: an additional NIR dataset, a two-stage detection model, and Patched-YOLO. First, to address data scarcity, we explore and apply various data augmentation strategies for both the NIR dataset and the classification dataset. Second, to improve night-time fire detection accuracy while reducing false positives caused by artificial lights, we propose a two-stage pipeline combining YOLOv11 and EfficientNetV2-B0. The proposed approach achieves higher detection accuracy compared to previous methods, particularly for night-time fire detection. Third, to improve fire detection in RGB images, especially for small and distant objects, we introduce Patched-YOLO, which enhances the model's detection capability through patch-based processing. Further details of these contributions are discussed in the following sections.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early pancreatic tumor detection is challenging due to minimal contrast margins and large anatomical variations in CT scans, requiring systems that enhance subtle visual cues and generalize well across multimodal imaging data.

Method: SRFA framework with preprocessing, MAGRes-UNet segmentation, DenseNet-121 feature extraction, HHO-BA metaheuristic feature selection, hybrid ViT-EfficientNet-B3 classification, and SSA-GWO dual optimization for hyperparameter tuning.

Result: Achieved 96.23% accuracy, 95.58% F1-score, and 94.83% specificity, significantly outperforming traditional CNNs and contemporary transformer-based models.

Conclusion: SRFA framework demonstrates strong potential as a valuable tool for early pancreatic tumor detection with superior performance metrics compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: The early detection of pancreatic neoplasm is a major clinical dilemma, and it is predominantly so because tumors are likely to occur with minimal contrast margins and a large spread anatomy-wide variation amongst patients on a CT scan. These complexities require to be addressed with an effective and scalable system that can assist in enhancing the salience of the subtle visual cues and provide a high level of the generalization on the multimodal imaging data. A Scalable Residual Feature Aggregation (SRFA) framework is proposed to be used to meet these conditions in this study. The framework integrates a pipeline of preprocessing followed by the segmentation using the MAGRes-UNet that is effective in making the pancreatic structures and isolating regions of interest more visible. DenseNet-121 performed with residual feature storage is used to extract features to allow deep hierarchical features to be aggregated without properties loss. To go further, hybrid HHO-BA metaheuristic feature selection strategy is used, which guarantees the best feature subset refinement. To be classified, the system is trained based on a new hybrid model that integrates the ability to pay attention on the world, which is the Vision Transformer (ViT) with the high representational efficiency of EfficientNet-B3. A dual optimization mechanism incorporating SSA and GWO is used to fine-tune hyperparameters to enhance greater robustness and less overfitting. Experimental results support the significant improvement in performance, with the suggested model reaching 96.23% accuracy, 95.58% F1-score and 94.83% specificity, the model is significantly better than the traditional CNNs and contemporary transformer-based models. Such results highlight the possibility of the SRFA framework as a useful instrument in the early detection of pancreatic tumors.

TL;DR: This paper develops a framework to measure memorization in 3D generative models and analyzes how data and modeling choices affect memorization, finding it depends on data modality, diversity, conditioning granularity, and can be reduced with specific techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether 3D generative models memorize training data, which could lead to data leakage and reduced diversity in generated outputs.

Method: Design an evaluation framework to quantify memorization, apply it to existing methods, and conduct controlled experiments with a latent vector-set diffusion model to study data and modeling factors.

Result: Memorization depends on data modality, increases with data diversity and finer-grained conditioning, peaks at moderate guidance scale, and can be mitigated by longer vector-sets and rotation augmentation.

Conclusion: The framework provides empirical understanding of memorization in 3D generative models and suggests effective strategies to reduce it without degrading generation quality.

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly used in 3D vision to synthesize novel shapes, yet it remains unclear whether their generation relies on memorizing training shapes. Understanding their memorization could help prevent training data leakage and improve the diversity of generated results. In this paper, we design an evaluation framework to quantify memorization in 3D generative models and study the influence of different data and modeling designs on memorization. We first apply our framework to quantify memorization in existing methods. Next, through controlled experiments with a latent vector-set (Vecset) diffusion model, we find that, on the data side, memorization depends on data modality, and increases with data diversity and finer-grained conditioning; on the modeling side, it peaks at a moderate guidance scale and can be mitigated by longer Vecsets and simple rotation augmentation. Together, our framework and analysis provide an empirical understanding of memorization in 3D generative models and suggest simple yet effective strategies to reduce it without degrading generation quality.

TL;DR: HAT is a spatio-temporal alignment module for autonomous driving perception that adaptively selects optimal alignment proposals from multiple motion hypotheses without supervision, improving 3D detection and tracking performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use attention mechanisms with simplified motion models (like constant velocity) for cross-frame alignment, but these are suboptimal due to variations in motion states and object features across categories and frames.

Method: HAT uses multiple explicit motion models to generate spatial anchors and motion-aware feature proposals for historical instances, then performs multi-hypothesis decoding by incorporating semantic and motion cues from cached object queries to select the optimal alignment proposal.

Result: Achieves SOTA tracking with 46.0% AMOTA on nuScenes test set with DETR3D; improves perception accuracy (+1.3% mAP, +3.1% AMOTA) and reduces collision rate by 32% in E2E AD; enables robust perception under semantic corruption (nuScenes-C).

Conclusion: HAT demonstrates the importance of adaptive motion modeling for spatio-temporal alignment in autonomous driving perception, outperforming existing methods and enhancing both perception and planning robustness.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal alignment is crucial for temporal modeling of end-to-end (E2E) perception in autonomous driving (AD), providing valuable structural and textural prior information. Existing methods typically rely on the attention mechanism to align objects across frames, simplifying the motion model with a unified explicit physical model (constant velocity, etc.). These approaches prefer semantic features for implicit alignment, challenging the importance of explicit motion modeling in the traditional perception paradigm. However, variations in motion states and object features across categories and frames render this alignment suboptimal. To address this, we propose HAT, a spatio-temporal alignment module that allows each object to adaptively decode the optimal alignment proposal from multiple hypotheses without direct supervision. Specifically, HAT first utilizes multiple explicit motion models to generate spatial anchors and motion-aware feature proposals for historical instances. It then performs multi-hypothesis decoding by incorporating semantic and motion cues embedded in cached object queries, ultimately providing the optimal alignment proposal for the target frame. On nuScenes, HAT consistently improves 3D temporal detectors and trackers across diverse baselines. It achieves state-of-the-art tracking results with 46.0% AMOTA on the test set when paired with the DETR3D detector. In an object-centric E2E AD method, HAT enhances perception accuracy (+1.3% mAP, +3.1% AMOTA) and reduces the collision rate by 32%. When semantics are corrupted (nuScenes-C), the enhancement of motion modeling by HAT enables more robust perception and planning in the E2E AD.

Motivation: Current omnimodal LLMs lack fine-grained cross-modal understanding and struggle with multimodal alignment, needing better audio-visual reasoning capabilities.

Method: Uses dynamic planning to autonomously orchestrate specialized tools on demand, with a coarse-to-fine audio-guided perception paradigm that leverages audio cues to localize temporal events.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three audio-video understanding benchmarks, surpassing leading open-source and proprietary models by 10-20% accuracy margins.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a paradigm shift from passive response generation to active multimodal inquiry, enabling more effective fine-grained audio-visual reasoning through dynamic tool orchestration.

Abstract: Omnimodal large language models have made significant strides in unifying audio and visual modalities; however, they often lack the fine-grained cross-modal understanding and have difficulty with multimodal alignment. To address these limitations, we introduce OmniAgent, a fully audio-guided active perception agent that dynamically orchestrates specialized tools to achieve more fine-grained audio-visual reasoning. Unlike previous works that rely on rigid, static workflows and dense frame-captioning, this paper demonstrates a paradigm shift from passive response generation to active multimodal inquiry. OmniAgent employs dynamic planning to autonomously orchestrate tool invocation on demand, strategically concentrating perceptual attention on task-relevant cues. Central to our approach is a novel coarse-to-fine audio-guided perception paradigm, which leverages audio cues to localize temporal events and guide subsequent reasoning. Extensive empirical evaluations on three audio-video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that OmniAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source and proprietary models by substantial margins of 10% - 20% accuracy.

*Kang Du,Yirui Guan,Zeyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IDT is a transformer-based feed-forward framework for multi-view intrinsic image decomposition that produces view-consistent diffuse reflectance, diffuse shading, and specular shading without iterative sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB images entangle material properties, illumination, and view-dependent effects, making intrinsic decomposition fundamental for visual understanding. While recent diffusion-based methods work for single-view, they struggle with multi-view consistency, leading to severe view inconsistency.

Method: IDT uses transformer-based attention to jointly reason over multiple input images, producing view-consistent intrinsic factors in a single forward pass. It adopts a physically grounded image formation model that explicitly decomposes images into diffuse reflectance, diffuse shading, and specular shading, separating Lambertian and non-Lambertian light transport.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show IDT achieves cleaner diffuse reflectance, more coherent diffuse shading, better-isolated specular components, and substantially improved multi-view consistency compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: IDT provides an effective feed-forward framework for multi-view intrinsic decomposition that produces interpretable and controllable material/illumination separation with strong view consistency, advancing beyond single-view approaches.

Abstract: Intrinsic image decomposition is fundamental for visual understanding, as RGB images entangle material properties, illumination, and view-dependent effects. Recent diffusion-based methods have achieved strong results for single-view intrinsic decomposition; however, extending these approaches to multi-view settings remains challenging, often leading to severe view inconsistency. We propose \textbf{Intrinsic Decomposition Transformer (IDT)}, a feed-forward framework for multi-view intrinsic image decomposition. By leveraging transformer-based attention to jointly reason over multiple input images, IDT produces view-consistent intrinsic factors in a single forward pass, without iterative generative sampling. IDT adopts a physically grounded image formation model that explicitly decomposes images into diffuse reflectance, diffuse shading, and specular shading. This structured factorization separates Lambertian and non-Lambertian light transport, enabling interpretable and controllable decomposition of material and illumination effects across views. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IDT achieves cleaner diffuse reflectance, more coherent diffuse shading, and better-isolated specular components, while substantially improving multi-view consistency compared to prior intrinsic decomposition methods.

TL;DR: DKT: A video diffusion model adapted for transparent object depth estimation via lightweight LoRA adapters, achieving SOTA on transparency benchmarks and improving robotic grasping success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transparent objects break traditional depth perception assumptions (stereo, ToF, monocular) causing holes and unstable estimates, but video diffusion models already synthesize convincing transparent phenomena, suggesting they've internalized optical rules.

Method: Build TransPhy3D synthetic corpus (11k sequences), train video-to-video translator for depth/normals via LoRA adapters on video diffusion model, concatenate RGB and noisy depth latents in DiT backbone, co-train on TransPhy3D and existing datasets.

Result: Zero-shot SOTA on transparency benchmarks (ClearPose, DREDS, TransPhy3D-Test), improved accuracy and temporal consistency, best video normal estimation on ClearPose, 1.3B version runs at ~0.17 s/frame, boosts robotic grasping success across surfaces.

Conclusion: "Diffusion knows transparency" - generative video priors can be efficiently repurposed into robust, temporally coherent perception for challenging real-world manipulation without labels.

Abstract: Transparent objects remain notoriously hard for perception systems: refraction, reflection and transmission break the assumptions behind stereo, ToF and purely discriminative monocular depth, causing holes and temporally unstable estimates. Our key observation is that modern video diffusion models already synthesize convincing transparent phenomena, suggesting they have internalized the optical rules. We build TransPhy3D, a synthetic video corpus of transparent/reflective scenes: 11k sequences rendered with Blender/Cycles. Scenes are assembled from a curated bank of category-rich static assets and shape-rich procedural assets paired with glass/plastic/metal materials. We render RGB + depth + normals with physically based ray tracing and OptiX denoising. Starting from a large video diffusion model, we learn a video-to-video translator for depth (and normals) via lightweight LoRA adapters. During training we concatenate RGB and (noisy) depth latents in the DiT backbone and co-train on TransPhy3D and existing frame-wise synthetic datasets, yielding temporally consistent predictions for arbitrary-length input videos. The resulting model, DKT, achieves zero-shot SOTA on real and synthetic video benchmarks involving transparency: ClearPose, DREDS (CatKnown/CatNovel), and TransPhy3D-Test. It improves accuracy and temporal consistency over strong image/video baselines, and a normal variant sets the best video normal estimation results on ClearPose. A compact 1.3B version runs at ~0.17 s/frame. Integrated into a grasping stack, DKT's depth boosts success rates across translucent, reflective and diffuse surfaces, outperforming prior estimators. Together, these results support a broader claim: "Diffusion knows transparency." Generative video priors can be repurposed, efficiently and label-free, into robust, temporally coherent perception for challenging real-world manipulation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stream-DiffVSR is a causal diffusion framework for efficient online video super-resolution that processes 720p frames in 0.328 seconds, making it the first diffusion-based VSR method suitable for low-latency deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based VSR methods achieve strong perceptual quality but are impractical for latency-sensitive settings due to reliance on future frames and expensive multi-step denoising.

Method: Combines a four-step distilled denoiser for fast inference, an Auto-regressive Temporal Guidance module for motion-aligned cues during latent denoising, and a lightweight temporal-aware decoder with Temporal Processor Module for enhanced detail and coherence.

Result: Processes 720p frames in 0.328 seconds on RTX4090, outperforms prior diffusion methods, boosts perceptual quality (LPIPS +0.095) vs SOTA TMP while reducing latency by over 130x, and reduces initial delay from 4600+ seconds to 0.328 seconds.

Conclusion: Stream-DiffVSR achieves the lowest latency reported for diffusion-based VSR, making it the first diffusion VSR method suitable for low-latency online deployment.

Abstract: Diffusion-based video super-resolution (VSR) methods achieve strong perceptual quality but remain impractical for latency-sensitive settings due to reliance on future frames and expensive multi-step denoising. We propose Stream-DiffVSR, a causally conditioned diffusion framework for efficient online VSR. Operating strictly on past frames, it combines a four-step distilled denoiser for fast inference, an Auto-regressive Temporal Guidance (ARTG) module that injects motion-aligned cues during latent denoising, and a lightweight temporal-aware decoder with a Temporal Processor Module (TPM) that enhances detail and temporal coherence. Stream-DiffVSR processes 720p frames in 0.328 seconds on an RTX4090 GPU and significantly outperforms prior diffusion-based methods. Compared with the online SOTA TMP, it boosts perceptual quality (LPIPS +0.095) while reducing latency by over 130x. Stream-DiffVSR achieves the lowest latency reported for diffusion-based VSR, reducing initial delay from over 4600 seconds to 0.328 seconds, thereby making it the first diffusion VSR method suitable for low-latency online deployment.

*Ndagijimana Cyprien,Mehdi Sookhak,Hosein Zarini,Chandra N Sekharan,Mohammed Atiquzzaman*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes Meta-A3C framework for joint UAV-UGV deployment optimization with road graph modeling and meta-learning for rapid adaptation to disaster scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Joint UAV-UGV deployment is effective for disaster communications, but requires optimal positioning and trajectory planning to ensure QoS while minimizing UAV usage.

Method: Introduces road graph for UGV mobility modeling, formulates sum rate optimization as MDP, and proposes novel asynchronous A3C with meta-learning (Meta-A3C) for rapid adaptation.

Result: Meta-A3C outperforms A3C and DDPG with 13.1% higher throughput and 49% faster execution while meeting QoS requirements.

Conclusion: The proposed Meta-A3C framework effectively solves joint UAV-UGV positioning and trajectory planning, providing superior performance and faster adaptation to dynamic disaster environments.

Abstract: Joint deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) has been shown to be an effective method to establish communications in areas affected by disasters. However, ensuring good Quality of Services (QoS) while using as few UAVs as possible also requires optimal positioning and trajectory planning for UAVs and UGVs. This paper proposes a joint UAV-UGV-based positioning and trajectory planning framework for UAVs and UGVs deployment that guarantees optimal QoS for ground users. To model the UGVs' mobility, we introduce a road graph, which directs their movement along valid road segments and adheres to the road network constraints. To solve the sum rate optimization problem, we reformulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a novel asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C) incorporated with meta-learning for rapid adaptation to new environments and dynamic conditions. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed Meta-A3C approach outperforms A3C and DDPG, delivering 13.1\% higher throughput and 49\% faster execution while meeting the QoS requirements.

TL;DR: Proposes Interactive Instance Object Navigation (IION) task and VL-LN benchmark for dialog-enabled embodied navigation where agents can actively consult an oracle during navigation to resolve ambiguous instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world navigation instructions are often vague and ambiguous, requiring agents to resolve uncertainty and infer user intent through active dialog, unlike existing idealized navigation tasks with well-defined instructions.

Method: Extends Instance Object Navigation (ION) to IION by allowing agents to freely consult an oracle in natural language while navigating. Creates VL-LN benchmark with 41k+ dialog-augmented trajectories and automatic evaluation protocol with oracle responses.

Result: Trained navigation model with dialog capabilities achieves significant improvements over baselines. Extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness and reliability of VL-LN benchmark for advancing dialog-enabled embodied navigation research.

Conclusion: IION task and VL-LN benchmark address the gap between idealized navigation tasks and practical real-world scenarios, enabling research on agents that can actively resolve ambiguity through dialog during navigation.

Abstract: In most existing embodied navigation tasks, instructions are well-defined and unambiguous, such as instruction following and object searching. Under this idealized setting, agents are required solely to produce effective navigation outputs conditioned on vision and language inputs. However, real-world navigation instructions are often vague and ambiguous, requiring the agent to resolve uncertainty and infer user intent through active dialog. To address this gap, we propose Interactive Instance Object Navigation (IION), a task that requires agents not only to generate navigation actions but also to produce language outputs via active dialog, thereby aligning more closely with practical settings. IION extends Instance Object Navigation (ION) by allowing agents to freely consult an oracle in natural language while navigating. Building on this task, we present the Vision Language-Language Navigation (VL-LN) benchmark, which provides a large-scale, automatically generated dataset and a comprehensive evaluation protocol for training and assessing dialog-enabled navigation models. VL-LN comprises over 41k long-horizon dialog-augmented trajectories for training and an automatic evaluation protocol with an oracle capable of responding to agent queries. Using this benchmark, we train a navigation model equipped with dialog capabilities and show that it achieves significant improvements over the baselines. Extensive experiments and analyses further demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of VL-LN for advancing research on dialog-enabled embodied navigation.

TL;DR: Human-to-robot skill transfer emerges in vision-language-action models when trained on sufficiently diverse scenes, tasks, and embodiments, enabling nearly double performance on generalization settings seen only in human data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human videos offer diverse real-world data that's easy to obtain, but training vision-language-action models with human videos alone is difficult due to the human-robot mapping challenge. The paper investigates whether scale-driven emergence of capabilities seen in large language models also occurs for VLAs with human video data.

Method: Introduces a simple co-training recipe where VLAs are pre-trained on diverse scenes, tasks, and embodiments. The approach leverages diverse pretraining to produce embodiment-agnostic representations that bridge human and robot data.

Result: Human-to-robot transfer emerges with sufficient diverse pretraining, enabling nearly double performance on generalization settings seen only in human data. Analysis shows this capability arises from embodiment-agnostic representations learned through diverse training.

Conclusion: Similar to large language models, vision-language-action models can develop emergent capabilities through scale and diversity. Human-to-robot skill transfer becomes possible when models are trained on sufficiently varied scenes, tasks, and embodiments, overcoming the human-robot mapping challenge.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models can enable broad open world generalization, but require large and diverse datasets. It is appealing to consider whether some of this data can come from human videos, which cover diverse real-world situations and are easy to obtain. However, it is difficult to train VLAs with human videos alone, and establishing a mapping between humans and robots requires manual engineering and presents a major research challenge. Drawing inspiration from advances in large language models, where the ability to learn from diverse supervision emerges with scale, we ask whether a similar phenomenon holds for VLAs that incorporate human video data. We introduce a simple co-training recipe, and find that human-to-robot transfer emerges once the VLA is pre-trained on sufficient scenes, tasks, and embodiments. Our analysis suggests that this emergent capability arises because diverse pretraining produces embodiment-agnostic representations for human and robot data. We validate these findings through a series of experiments probing human to robot skill transfer and find that with sufficiently diverse robot pre-training our method can nearly double the performance on generalization settings seen only in human data.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Robust collective motion for artificial swarms using locust-inspired mechanisms: combining visual size cues for distance estimation and intermittent locomotion for fault detection/avoidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural collective motion is robust but artificial swarms are brittle, especially with vision-based sensing due to perceptual ambiguities and information loss.

Method: Two locust-inspired mechanisms: 1) robust distance estimation combining perceived horizontal and vertical sizes of neighbors, 2) intermittent locomotion for reliable fault detection and avoidance of lagging robots.

Result: Dramatic improvements in swarm resilience shown through extensive physics-based simulations, applicable to both distance-based Avoid-Attract models and Alignment-based models across various settings.

Conclusion: Locust-inspired visual perception and intermittent motion mechanisms enable robust collective motion in artificial swarms, overcoming brittleness of traditional vision-based approaches.

Abstract: In collective motion, perceptually-limited individuals move in an ordered manner, without centralized control. The perception of each individual is highly localized, as is its ability to interact with others. While natural collective motion is robust, most artificial swarms are brittle. This particularly occurs when vision is used as the sensing modality, due to ambiguities and information-loss inherent in visual perception. This paper presents mechanisms for robust collective motion inspired by studies of locusts. First, we develop a robust distance estimation method that combines visually perceived horizontal and vertical sizes of neighbors. Second, we introduce intermittent locomotion as a mechanism that allows robots to reliably detect peers that fail to keep up, and disrupt the motion of the swarm. We show how such faulty robots can be avoided in a manner that is robust to errors in classifying them as faulty. Through extensive physics-based simulation experiments, we show dramatic improvements to swarm resilience when using these techniques. We show these are relevant to both distance-based Avoid-Attract models, as well as to models relying on Alignment, in a wide range of experiment settings.

### [185] [Asymmetric Friction in Geometric Locomotion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22484)
*Ross L. Hatton,Yousef Salaman,Shai Revzen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Extends geometric locomotion models from Riemannian to Finsler metrics to handle asymmetric friction, developing sub-Finslerian motility maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous geometric mechanics models assume symmetric friction (Riemannian metrics), but real-world systems often have asymmetric friction (different forward/backward coefficients). Need to extend theory to handle more general asymmetric drag.

Method: Extends sub-Riemannian approach to sub-Finslerian framework, replacing Riemannian metrics on body parts with Finsler metrics to model asymmetric friction. Develops analogous system properties to constraint curvature for characterizing motion capabilities.

Result: Demonstrates that the sub-Riemannian approach naturally extends to sub-Finslerian construction of motility maps. Identifies system properties analogous to constraint curvature for characterizing motion in asymmetric friction systems.

Conclusion: Geometric locomotion theory can be generalized from symmetric (Riemannian) to asymmetric (Finsler) friction systems, providing a more comprehensive framework for analyzing real-world robotic and biological locomotion with directional drag differences.

Abstract: Geometric mechanics models of locomotion have provided insight into how robots and animals use environmental interactions to convert internal shape changes into displacement through the world, encoding this relationship in a ``motility map''. A key class of such motility maps arises from (possibly anisotropic) linear drag acting on the system's individual body parts, formally described via Riemannian metrics on the motions of the system's individual body parts. The motility map can then be generated by invoking a sub-Riemannian constraint on the aggregate system motion under which the position velocity induced by a given shape velocity is that which minimizes the power dissipated via friction. The locomotion of such systems is ``geometric'' in the sense that the final position reached by the system depends only on the sequence of shapes that the system passes through, but not on the rate with which the shape changes are made.
  In this paper, we consider a far more general class of systems in which the drag may be not only anisotropic (with different coefficients for forward/backward and left/right motions), but also asymmetric (with different coefficients for forward and backward motions). Formally, including asymmetry in the friction replaces the Riemannian metrics on the body parts with Finsler metrics. We demonstrate that the sub-Riemannian approach to constructing the system motility map extends naturally to a sub-Finslerian approach and identify system properties analogous to the constraint curvature of sub-Riemannian systems that allow for the characterization of the system motion capabilities.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel ball-end milling path planning method for multiply connected freeform surfaces that combines conformal slit mapping with topology-preserving optimization to generate continuous, boundary-conforming toolpaths free of self-intersections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scalar-field-based optimization methods for multi-objective toolpath generation struggle with maintaining boundary conformity and eliminating zero-gradient singularities that cause iso-curve branching/termination, disrupting toolpath continuity on multiply connected surfaces.

Method: Uses conformal slit mapping to create singularity-free initial scalar field, then reformulates optimization as topology-preserving mesh deformation with boundary-synchronous updates to achieve globally optimized spacing, scallop-height uniformity, and smooth trajectory transitions.

Result: Compared to state-of-the-art conformal slit mapping methods: 14.24% increase in machining efficiency, 5.70% improvement in scallop-height uniformity, and over 10% reduction in milling impact-induced vibrations.

Conclusion: The proposed strategy robustly enforces boundary conformity and eliminates singularities throughout optimization, producing continuous, boundary-conforming toolpaths without self-intersections, offering broad applicability in high-performance machining scenarios.

Abstract: Ball-end milling path planning on multiply connected freeform surfaces is pivotal for high-quality and efficient machining of components in automotive and aerospace manufacturing. Although scalar-field-based optimization provides a unified framework for multi-objective toolpath generation, maintaining boundary conformity while eliminating zero-gradient singularities that cause iso-curve branching or termination and disrupt toolpath continuity remains challenging on multiply connected surfaces. We propose an efficient strategy to robustly enforce these constraints throughout optimization. Conformal slit mapping is employed to construct a feasible, singularity-free initial scalar field. The optimization is reformulated as a topology-preserving mesh deformation governed by boundary-synchronous updates, enabling globally optimized spacing, scallop-height uniformity, and smooth trajectory transitions. Consequently, the toolpaths are continuous, boundary-conforming, and free of self-intersections. Milling experiments demonstrate that, compared with a state-of-the-art conformal slit mapping-based method, the proposed approach increases machining efficiency by 14.24%, improves scallop-height uniformity by 5.70%, and reduces milling impact-induced vibrations by over 10%. The strategy offers broad applicability in high-performance machining scenarios.

TL;DR: OBEYED-VLA disentangles perception from action in vision-language-action models by adding object-centric geometric grounding, improving robustness to distractors, clutter, and appearance changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models entangle perception and control in monolithic pipelines optimized for action prediction, which erodes language-conditioned grounding and causes issues like over-grasping, distraction by clutter, and overfitting to background appearance.

Method: Proposes OBEYED-VLA framework with explicit perceptual grounding: 1) VLM-based object-centric grounding stage selects task-relevant object regions across camera views, 2) complementary geometric grounding stage emphasizes 3D structure over appearance, 3) feeds grounded views to pretrained VLA policy fine-tuned on single-object demonstrations without clutter.

Result: Substantially improves robustness over strong VLA baselines on real-world UR10e tabletop setup across four challenging regimes: distractor objects, absent-target rejection, background appearance changes, and cluttered manipulation of unseen objects.

Conclusion: Making perception an explicit, object-centric component is an effective way to strengthen and generalize VLA-based robotic manipulation, with both semantic and geometry-aware grounding being critical to performance gains.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made impressive progress toward general-purpose robotic manipulation by post-training large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for action prediction. Yet most VLAs entangle perception and control in a monolithic pipeline optimized purely for action, which can erode language-conditioned grounding. In our real-world tabletop tests, policies over-grasp when the target is absent, are distracted by clutter, and overfit to background appearance.
  To address these issues, we propose OBEYED-VLA (OBject-centric and gEometrY groundED VLA), a framework that explicitly disentangles perceptual grounding from action reasoning. Instead of operating directly on raw RGB, OBEYED-VLA augments VLAs with a perception module that grounds multi-view inputs into task-conditioned, object-centric, and geometry-aware observations. This module includes a VLM-based object-centric grounding stage that selects task-relevant object regions across camera views, along with a complementary geometric grounding stage that emphasizes the 3D structure of these objects over their appearance. The resulting grounded views are then fed to a pretrained VLA policy, which we fine-tune exclusively on single-object demonstrations collected without environmental clutter or non-target objects.
  On a real-world UR10e tabletop setup, OBEYED-VLA substantially improves robustness over strong VLA baselines across four challenging regimes and multiple difficulty levels: distractor objects, absent-target rejection, background appearance changes, and cluttered manipulation of unseen objects. Ablation studies confirm that both semantic grounding and geometry-aware grounding are critical to these gains. Overall, the results indicate that making perception an explicit, object-centric component is an effective way to strengthen and generalize VLA-based robotic manipulation.

TL;DR: VLA-Arena benchmark systematically evaluates Vision-Language-Action models across structured task dimensions with fine-grained difficulty levels to identify failure modes and capability limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While VLAs are advancing rapidly, there's a lack of quantitative understanding of their limits and failure modes, making it difficult to systematically assess their capabilities and robustness.

Method: Introduces a structured task design framework with three orthogonal axes: Task Structure (4 dimensions), Language Command (5 levels), and Visual Observation (5 levels). Creates 170 tasks with three difficulty levels (L0-L2), using fine-tuning only on L0 to test generalization.

Result: Evaluation reveals critical limitations: strong memorization over generalization, asymmetric robustness, lack of safety constraint consideration, and inability to compose skills for long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: VLA-Arena provides a comprehensive benchmark with end-to-end toolchain for systematic evaluation of VLAs, enabling reproducible research to address identified limitations and advance generalist robot policies.

Abstract: While Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) are rapidly advancing towards generalist robot policies, it remains difficult to quantitatively understand their limits and failure modes. To address this, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark called VLA-Arena. We propose a novel structured task design framework to quantify difficulty across three orthogonal axes: (1) Task Structure, (2) Language Command, and (3) Visual Observation. This allows us to systematically design tasks with fine-grained difficulty levels, enabling a precise measurement of model capability frontiers. For Task Structure, VLA-Arena's 170 tasks are grouped into four dimensions: Safety, Distractor, Extrapolation, and Long Horizon. Each task is designed with three difficulty levels (L0-L2), with fine-tuning performed exclusively on L0 to assess general capability. Orthogonal to this, language (W0-W4) and visual (V0-V4) perturbations can be applied to any task to enable a decoupled analysis of robustness. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art VLAs reveals several critical limitations, including a strong tendency toward memorization over generalization, asymmetric robustness, a lack of consideration for safety constraints, and an inability to compose learned skills for long-horizon tasks. To foster research addressing these challenges and ensure reproducibility, we provide the complete VLA-Arena framework, including an end-to-end toolchain from task definition to automated evaluation and the VLA-Arena-S/M/L datasets for fine-tuning. Our benchmark, data, models, and leaderboard are available at https://vla-arena.github.io.

TL;DR: GPU-accelerated parallel mapping and motion planning framework for real-time collision-free robotic manipulation in unknown environments using EDT-based mapping and sampling-based MPC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time collision-free motion planning in unknown environments is challenging due to continuous perception updates and frequent online replanning needs. Existing approaches struggle with computational efficiency and false self-collision detections during dynamic environment updates.

Method: Proposes ParaMaP framework with two components: 1) GPU-based Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) mapping with robot-masked updates to prevent false self-collisions, and 2) Sampling-based Model Predictive Control (SMPC) planner that formulates motion generation as stochastic optimization with SE(3) pose tracking metric, evaluating large batches of candidate rollouts in parallel on GPU.

Result: Framework enables high-frequency replanning on GPU, validated through extensive simulations and real-world experiments on a 7-DoF robotic manipulator, demonstrating effective real-time collision-free motion planning in unknown environments.

Conclusion: The proposed parallel mapping and planning framework successfully addresses real-time motion planning challenges by tightly integrating GPU-accelerated EDT mapping with SMPC planning, enabling efficient collision-free manipulation in dynamic unknown environments.

Abstract: Real-time and collision-free motion planning remains challenging for robotic manipulation in unknown environments due to continuous perception updates and the need for frequent online replanning. To address these challenges, we propose a parallel mapping and motion planning framework that tightly integrates Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT)-based environment representation with a sampling-based model predictive control (SMPC) planner. On the mapping side, a dense distance-field-based representation is constructed using a GPU-based EDT and augmented with a robot-masked update mechanism to prevent false self-collision detections during online perception. On the planning side, motion generation is formulated as a stochastic optimization problem with a unified objective function and efficiently solved by evaluating large batches of candidate rollouts in parallel within a SMPC framework, in which a geometrically consistent pose tracking metric defined on SE(3) is incorporated to ensure fast and accurate convergence to the target pose. The entire mapping and planning pipeline is implemented on the GPU to support high-frequency replanning. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through extensive simulations and real-world experiments on a 7-DoF robotic manipulator.

### [190] [Modeling of UAV Tether Aerodynamics for Real-Time Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22588)
*Max Beffert,Andreas Zell*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Two real-time tether modeling approaches for tethered UAVs: an analytical catenary-based method (<1ms) and a numerical lumped-mass method (5ms), both validated with real-world force measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tethered UAVs solve battery limitations but require accurate tether force modeling, especially for moving bases or windy conditions where aerodynamic effects matter.

Method: Two complementary approaches: 1) Analytical method using catenary theory with uniform drag assumption; 2) Numerical method discretizing tether into segments with lumped masses, solved with CasADi and IPOPT using warm-start initialization.

Result: Both methods achieved real-time performance (<1ms for analytical, 5ms for numerical) and were validated with load cell measurements. Analytical method provides sufficient accuracy for most applications with minimal computation, while numerical method offers higher flexibility and physical accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed approaches form a lightweight, extensible framework for real-time tether simulation applicable to offline optimization and online tasks like simulation, control, and trajectory planning for tethered UAV systems.

Abstract: One of the main limitations of multirotor UAVs is their short flight time due to battery constraints. A practical solution for continuous operation is to power the drone from the ground via a tether. While this approach has been demonstrated for stationary systems, scenarios with a fast-moving base vehicle or strong wind conditions require modeling the tether forces, including aerodynamic effects. In this work, we propose two complementary approaches for real-time quasi-static tether modeling with aerodynamics. The first is an analytical method based on catenary theory with a uniform drag assumption, achieving very fast solve times below 1ms. The second is a numerical method that discretizes the tether into segments and lumped masses, solving the equilibrium equations using CasADi and IPOPT. By leveraging initialization strategies, such as warm starting and analytical initialization, real-time performance was achieved with a solve time of 5ms, while allowing for flexible force formulations. Both approaches were validated in real-world tests using a load cell to measure the tether force. The results show that the analytical method provides sufficient accuracy for most tethered UAV applications with minimal computational cost, while the numerical method offers higher flexibility and physical accuracy when required. These approaches form a lightweight and extensible framework for real-time tether simulation, applicable to both offline optimization and online tasks such as simulation, control, and trajectory planning.

*Michelle Valenzuela,Francisco Leiva,Javier Ruiz-del-Solar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Coverage navigation system for non-holonomic robots with recovery behaviors for dynamic obstacles, achieving ~90% coverage in tests, with mining industry applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating coverage navigation tasks in mining industry (cleaning, dumps, tailings dam construction) to enhance safety and efficiency, with broader applications in mobile robotics like robotic vacuum cleaners.

Method: Developed coverage navigation system for non-holonomic robots that calculates coverage routes and incorporates recovery behaviors for dynamic/unmapped obstacles, enabling evasive maneuvers and post-recovery to ensure complete coverage.

Result: System tested in simulated and real outdoor environments, achieving near 90% coverage in most experiments, with successful demonstration in real-world tests.

Conclusion: Proof of concept successful for mining automation applications; next step is scaling up to actual mining vehicles and real-environment validation.

Abstract: In mobile robotics, coverage navigation refers to the deliberate movement of a robot with the purpose of covering a certain area or volume. Performing this task properly is fundamental for the execution of several activities, for instance, cleaning a facility with a robotic vacuum cleaner. In the mining industry, it is required to perform coverage in several unit processes related with material movement using industrial machinery, for example, in cleaning tasks, in dumps, and in the construction of tailings dam walls. The automation of these processes is fundamental to enhance the security associated with their execution. In this work, a coverage navigation system for a non-holonomic robot is presented. This work is intended to be a proof of concept for the potential automation of various unit processes that require coverage navigation like the ones mentioned before. The developed system includes the calculation of routes that allow a mobile platform to cover a specific area, and incorporates recovery behaviors in case that an unforeseen event occurs, such as the arising of dynamic or previously unmapped obstacles in the terrain to be covered, e.g., other machines or pedestrians passing through the area, being able to perform evasive maneuvers and post-recovery to ensure a complete coverage of the terrain. The system was tested in different simulated and real outdoor environments, obtaining results near 90% of coverage in the majority of experiments. The next step of development is to scale up the utilized robot to a mining machine/vehicle whose operation will be validated in a real environment. The result of one of the tests performed in the real world can be seen in the video available in https://youtu.be/gK7_3bK1P5g.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently learn unknown constraints in demonstrator's environments from sparse demonstrations, overcoming limitations of random sampling approaches.

Method: Iterative ACL algorithm using Gaussian processes to model unknown constraints, actively querying start/goal states based on GP posterior, and generating informative demonstrations to expand dataset.

Result: Outperforms random-sampling baseline at accurately performing constraint inference from sparse but informative demonstrations in simulation and hardware experiments with high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics.

Conclusion: Active constraint learning with intelligent querying generates more informative demonstrations than random sampling, enabling accurate constraint inference from sparse data in complex environments.

Abstract: We present an iterative active constraint learning (ACL) algorithm, within the learning from demonstrations (LfD) paradigm, which intelligently solicits informative demonstration trajectories for inferring an unknown constraint in the demonstrator's environment. Our approach iteratively trains a Gaussian process (GP) on the available demonstration dataset to represent the unknown constraints, uses the resulting GP posterior to query start/goal states, and generates informative demonstrations which are added to the dataset. Across simulation and hardware experiments using high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics and unknown nonlinear constraints, our method outperforms a baseline, random-sampling based method at accurately performing constraint inference from an iteratively generated set of sparse but informative demonstrations.

*Naoki Kitamura,Yuichi Sudo,Koichi Wada*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Complete characterization of computational power for two autonomous robots across all major models (OBLOT, FSTA, FCOM, LUMI) under various schedulers, revealing a fundamentally different landscape from general n-robot case.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While the computational power of autonomous mobile robots under LCM model has been widely studied for general n-robot cases, the exact structure for two robots has remained unresolved, creating a gap in understanding minimal-scale coordination.

Method: Novel simulation-free method to derive equivalence and separation results across all major robot models (OBLOT, FSTA, FCOM, LUMI) under full spectrum of schedulers (FSYNCH, SSYNCH, ASYNCH and atomic variants).

Result: Revealed fundamentally different landscape from general case: FSTA^F and LUMI^F coincide under full synchrony; FSTA and FCOM are orthogonal with bidirectional incomparability; complete computational hierarchy for two robots established.

Conclusion: First complete and exact computational landscape for two robots demonstrates that perfect synchrony can substitute both memory and communication at minimal scale, highlighting intrinsic challenges of coordination with only two agents.

Abstract: The computational power of autonomous mobile robots under the Look-Compute-Move (LCM) model has been widely studied through an extensive hierarchy of robot models defined by the presence of memory, communication, and synchrony assumptions. While the general n-robot landscape has been largely established, the exact structure for two robots has remained unresolved. This paper presents the first complete characterization of the computational power of two autonomous robots across all major models, namely OBLOT, FSTA, FCOM, and LUMI, under the full spectrum of schedulers (FSYNCH, SSYNCH, ASYNCH, and their atomic variants). Our results reveal a landscape that fundamentally differs from the general case. Most notably, we prove that FSTA^F and LUMI^F coincide under full synchrony, a surprising collapse indicating that perfect synchrony can substitute both memory and communication when only two robots exist. We also show that FSTA and FCOM are orthogonal: there exists a problem solvable in the weakest communication model but impossible even in the strongest finite-state model, completing the bidirectional incomparability. All equivalence and separation results are derived through a novel simulation-free method, providing a unified and constructive view of the two-robot hierarchy. This yields the first complete and exact computational landscape for two robots, highlighting the intrinsic challenges of coordination at the minimal scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critique the application of computational and information-theoretic frameworks to understanding animal bodies and designing robots, arguing that computation is not the main function of bodies.

Method: Philosophical commentary and argumentation analyzing the limitations of applying computational metaphors to physical bodies, drawing on information theory and evolutionary perspectives.

Result: The paper concludes that bodies serve functions beyond computation, and that viewing them primarily as computational entities may be misleading for both biological understanding and robotics design.

Conclusion: While computation and information theory have been valuable in understanding minds and nervous systems, they should not be overextended to bodies, which have evolved for different primary purposes than computation.

Abstract: Applying the lens of computation and information has been instrumental in driving the technological progress of our civilization as well as in empowering our understanding of the world around us. The digital computer was and for many still is the leading metaphor for how our mind operates. Information theory (IT) has also been important in our understanding of how nervous systems encode and process information. The target article deploys information and computation to bodies: to understand why they have evolved in particular ways (animal bodies) and to design optimal bodies (robots). In this commentary, I argue that the main role of bodies is not to compute.

TL;DR: P-FABRIK: A general inverse kinematics method for parallel mechanisms using FABRIK algorithm decomposition


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional geometric inverse kinematics methods struggle with redundant parallel mechanisms due to increased constraint complexity and fail when target poses are outside workspace, causing unpredictable control problems.

Method: Proposes P-FABRIK based on FABRIK algorithm, decomposing parallel mechanisms into multiple serial sub-chains using new topological decomposition strategy, then iteratively revising end targets of each sub-chain to calculate inverse kinematics solutions.

Result: Multiple case studies with planar, standard, and redundant parallel mechanisms demonstrate method's generality across diverse parallel mechanisms. Numerical simulations verify efficacy, computational efficiency, and robustness in handling out-of-workspace targets.

Conclusion: P-FABRIK provides a general, intuitive, and robust inverse kinematics solution for parallel mechanisms that overcomes limitations of traditional geometric methods, particularly for redundant mechanisms and out-of-workspace scenarios.

Abstract: Traditional geometric inverse kinematics methods for parallel mechanisms rely on specific spatial geometry constraints. However, their application to redundant parallel mechanisms is challenged due to the increased constraint complexity. Moreover, it will output no solutions and cause unpredictable control problems when the target pose lies outside its workspace. To tackle these challenging issues, this work proposes P-FABRIK, a general, intuitive, and robust inverse kinematics method to find one feasible solution for diverse parallel mechanisms based on the FABRIK algorithm. By decomposing the general parallel mechanism into multiple serial sub-chains using a new topological decomposition strategy, the end targets of each sub-chain can be subsequently revised to calculate the inverse kinematics solutions iteratively. Multiple case studies involving planar, standard, and redundant parallel mechanisms demonstrated the proposed method's generality across diverse parallel mechanisms. Furthermore, numerical simulation studies verified its efficacy and computational efficiency, as well as its robustness ability to handle out-of-workspace targets.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PreGME: A prescribed performance motion control framework using variable-gain extended state observers for aerial manipulators to handle dynamic coupling and achieve high-precision tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aerial manipulators (multirotor + robotic arm) suffer from significant dynamic coupling between components, making precise and robust motion control challenging but essential for practical applications.

Method: Proposed PreGME framework combines: 1) Variable-gain ESOs for real-time estimation of rapidly varying dynamic coupling, and 2) Prescribed performance flight control with error trajectory constraints that guide system evolution along preset error trajectories.

Result: Experimental validation on real platform shows high tracking performance even under aggressive robotic arm motion (end-effector velocity: 1.02 m/s, acceleration: 5.10 m/s²). Successful demonstrations include aerial staff twirling, aerial mixology, and aerial cart-pulling tasks.

Conclusion: The PreGME framework effectively handles dynamic coupling in aerial manipulators through variable-gain ESOs and prescribed performance control, enabling aggressive manipulation tasks while maintaining high-precision tracking within prescribed error bounds.

Abstract: An aerial manipulator, comprising a multirotor base and a robotic arm, is subject to significant dynamic coupling between these two components. Therefore, achieving precise and robust motion control is a challenging yet important objective. Here, we propose a novel prescribed performance motion control framework based on variable-gain extended state observers (ESOs), referred to as PreGME. The method includes variable-gain ESOs for real-time estimation of dynamic coupling and a prescribed performance flight control that incorporates error trajectory constraints. Compared with existing methods, the proposed approach exhibits the following two characteristics. First, the adopted variable-gain ESOs can accurately estimate rapidly varying dynamic coupling. This enables the proposed method to handle manipulation tasks that require aggressive motion of the robotic arm. Second, by prescribing the performance, a preset error trajectory is generated to guide the system evolution along this trajectory. This strategy allows the proposed method to ensure the tracking error remains within the prescribed performance envelope, thereby achieving high-precision control. Experiments on a real platform, including aerial staff twirling, aerial mixology, and aerial cart-pulling experiments, are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
  Experimental results demonstrate that even under the dynamic coupling caused by rapid robotic arm motion (end-effector velocity: 1.02 m/s, acceleration: 5.10 m/s$^2$), the proposed method achieves high tracking performance.

TL;DR: MoVLR uses vision-language models to automatically discover reward functions for musculoskeletal control by iteratively aligning policies with physically coordinated behaviors through VLM feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing effective reward functions for high-dimensional musculoskeletal systems is challenging because humans can describe movement goals explicitly (e.g., "walking forward with upright posture") but the underlying control strategies are implicit, making it hard to directly translate high-level goals into rewards.

Method: MoVLR framework leverages vision-language models to bridge goal specification and movement control. It iteratively explores reward space through interaction between control optimization and VLM feedback, transforming language/vision assessments into structured guidance for embodied learning.

Result: The approach enables discovery and refinement of reward functions for high-dimensional musculoskeletal locomotion and manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: Vision-language models can effectively ground abstract motion descriptions in the implicit principles governing physiological motor control, providing a pathway to automate reward function design for complex musculoskeletal systems.

Abstract: Discovering effective reward functions remains a fundamental challenge in motor control of high-dimensional musculoskeletal systems. While humans can describe movement goals explicitly such as "walking forward with an upright posture," the underlying control strategies that realize these goals are largely implicit, making it difficult to directly design rewards from high-level goals and natural language descriptions. We introduce Motion from Vision-Language Representation (MoVLR), a framework that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to bridge the gap between goal specification and movement control. Rather than relying on handcrafted rewards, MoVLR iteratively explores the reward space through iterative interaction between control optimization and VLM feedback, aligning control policies with physically coordinated behaviors. Our approach transforms language and vision-based assessments into structured guidance for embodied learning, enabling the discovery and refinement of reward functions for high-dimensional musculoskeletal locomotion and manipulation. These results suggest that VLMs can effectively ground abstract motion descriptions in the implicit principles governing physiological motor control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blender is powerful for 3D graphics but has a steep learning curve and lacks robotics-specific tools, making it difficult for researchers to create publication-quality visualizations efficiently.

Method: Developed a software library with three main features: 1) Import robots/environments from URDF, 2) Python scripting for keyframing robot states and visual attributes, 3) Generation of primitive 3D shapes for schematic figures.

Result: The library enables robotics researchers to rapidly create publication-ready images, animations, and explanatory schematics without extensive Blender expertise, demonstrated through proof-of-concept examples.

Conclusion: The library bridges the gap between Blender's capabilities and robotics visualization needs, with discussion of current limitations and opportunities for future extensions.

Abstract: High-quality visualizations are an essential part of robotics research, enabling clear communication of results through figures, animations, and demonstration videos. While Blender is a powerful and freely available 3D graphics platform, its steep learning curve and lack of robotics-focused integrations make it difficult and time-consuming for researchers to use effectively. In this work, we introduce a lightweight software library that bridges this gap by providing simple scripting interfaces for common robotics visualization tasks. The library offers three primary capabilities: (1) importing robots and environments directly from standardized descriptions such as URDF; (2) Python-based scripting tools for keyframing robot states and visual attributes; and (3) convenient generation of primitive 3D shapes for schematic figures and animations. Together, these features allow robotics researchers to rapidly create publication-ready images, animations, and explanatory schematics without needing extensive Blender expertise. We demonstrate the library through a series of proof-of-concept examples and conclude with a discussion of current limitations and opportunities for future extensions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robot specification files (URDF, SDF, MJCF, USD) only encode basic kinematic, dynamic, and geometric information, forcing downstream applications to repeatedly re-derive richer data, leading to redundant computations, fragmented implementations, and limited standardization.

Conclusion: URDD provides a unified, extensible resource for reducing redundancy and establishing shared standards across robotics frameworks, though limitations and implications are discussed.

Abstract: Robots are typically described in software by specification files (e.g., URDF, SDF, MJCF, USD) that encode only basic kinematic, dynamic, and geometric information. As a result, downstream applications such as simulation, planning, and control must repeatedly re-derive richer data, leading to redundant computations, fragmented implementations, and limited standardization. In this work, we introduce the Universal Robot Description Directory (URDD), a modular representation that organizes derived robot information into structured, easy-to-parse JSON and YAML modules. Our open-source toolkit automatically generates URDDs from URDFs, with a Rust implementation supporting Bevy-based visualization. Additionally, we provide a JavaScript/Three.js viewer for web-based inspection of URDDs. Experiments on multiple robot platforms show that URDDs can be generated efficiently, encapsulate substantially richer information than standard specification files, and directly enable the construction of core robotics subroutines.

TL;DR: Interactive tool for generating and visualizing self-collision matrices across multiple shape representations, enabling dynamic inspection and refinement for robotics applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tools for generating self-collision matrices (like MoveIt Setup Assistant) have limitations: static visualization, lack of proximity support, rigid single-geometry assumptions, and tedious refinement workflows, which hinder flexibility and reuse in downstream robotics applications.

Method: Developed an interactive tool that generates and visualizes self-collision matrices across multiple shape representations, enabling dynamic inspection, filtering, and refinement of shape pairs. The system is implemented in Rust using the Bevy game engine for high-quality visualizations, with outputs in JSON and YAML formats.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on multiple robot platforms, showing that matrices generated using diverse shape types yield faster and more accurate self-collision and self-proximity queries compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The interactive tool overcomes limitations of current self-collision matrix generation methods by providing dynamic visualization, support for multiple shape representations, and flexible refinement workflows, enabling better integration and performance in robotics applications.

Abstract: In robotics, it is common to check whether a given robot state results in self-intersection (i.e., a self-collision query) or to assess its distance from such an intersection (i.e., a self-proximity query). These checks are typically performed between pairs of shapes attached to different robot links. However, many of these shape pairs can be excluded in advance, as their configurations are known to always or never result in contact. This information is typically encoded in a self-collision matrix, where each entry (i, j) indicates whether a check should be performed between shape i and shape j. While the MoveIt Setup Assistant is widely used to generate such matrices, current tools are limited by static visualization, lack of proximity support, rigid single-geometry assumptions, and tedious refinement workflows, hindering flexibility and reuse in downstream robotics applications. In this work, we introduce an interactive tool that overcomes these limitations by generating and visualizing self-collision matrices across multiple shape representations, enabling dynamic inspection, filtering, and refinement of shape pairs. Outputs are provided in both JSON and YAML for easy integration. The system is implemented in Rust and uses the Bevy game engine to deliver high-quality visualizations. We demonstrate its effectiveness on multiple robot platforms, showing that matrices generated using diverse shape types yield faster and more accurate self-collision and self-proximity queries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pole-like structures are useful for robot localization but degrade under distance observations; need systematic evaluation of descriptor robustness rather than just descriptor design.

Method: Created SPL dataset via automated tracking-based association pipeline for multi-view, multi-distance observations; compared Contrastive Learning (CL) vs Supervised Learning (SL) paradigms for feature space robustness.

Result: CL induces more robust feature space for sparse geometry, achieving superior retrieval performance particularly in 5-10m range compared to SL.

Conclusion: Provides empirical foundation and scalable methodology for evaluating landmark distinctiveness in challenging real-world scenarios, with CL showing better performance for pole landmark matching.

Abstract: While pole-like structures are widely recognized as stable geometric anchors for long-term robot localization, their identification reliability degrades significantly under Pole-at-Distance (Pad) observations typical of large-scale urban environments. This paper shifts the focus from descriptor design to a systematic investigation of descriptor robustness. Our primary contribution is the establishment of a specialized evaluation framework centered on the Small Pole Landmark (SPL) dataset. This dataset is constructed via an automated tracking-based association pipeline that captures multi-view, multi-distance observations of the same physical landmarks without manual annotation. Using this framework, we present a comparative analysis of Contrastive Learning (CL) and Supervised Learning (SL) paradigms. Our findings reveal that CL induces a more robust feature space for sparse geometry, achieving superior retrieval performance particularly in the 5--10m range. This work provides an empirical foundation and a scalable methodology for evaluating landmark distinctiveness in challenging real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for coupling mechanisms in lattice-based modular robot systems for large-scale construction in extreme environments (like space) that meet complex requirements: single-sided coupling/decoupling, flat surfaces when uncoupled, and compatibility with both passive interfaces and other coupling mechanisms.

Method: Proposed a shape-matching mechanical coupling mechanism with controlled sequential transitions between male and female states. All mechanisms start in female state when uncoupled; one side switches to male state during coupling process to enable single-sided operation. Single-sided decoupling possible from both sides by forcibly switching opposite mechanism's state.

Result: The mechanism satisfies all design requirements: enables single-sided coupling and decoupling, maintains flat surfaces when uncoupled, and works with passive coupling interfaces as well as between coupling mechanisms.

Conclusion: This novel coupling mechanism can be applied to various modular robot systems and robot arm tool changers, providing a versatile solution for complex coupling requirements in extreme environment construction applications.

Abstract: Lattice-based modular robot systems are envisioned for large-scale construction in extreme environments, such as space. Coupling mechanisms for heterogeneous structural modules should meet all of the following requirements: single-sided coupling and decoupling, flat surfaces when uncoupled, and coupling to passive coupling interfaces as well as coupling behavior between coupling mechanisms. The design requirements for such a coupling mechanism are complex. We propose a novel shape-matching mechanical coupling mechanism that satisfies these design requirements. This mechanism enables controlled, sequential transitions between male and female states. When uncoupled, all mechanisms are in the female state. To enable single-sided coupling, one side of the mechanisms switches to the male state during the coupling process. Single-sided decoupling is possible not only from the male side but also from the female side by forcibly switching the opposite mechanism's male state to the female state. This coupling mechanism can be applied to various modular robot systems and robot arm tool changers.

TL;DR: Surgical VLA policy trained on synthetic video-action data from SurgWorld world model outperforms real-data-only training, enabling scalable autonomous surgical skill acquisition from abundant unlabeled videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surgical robotics faces data scarcity for paired visual-kinematic data needed for VLA models, while abundant surgical videos lack action labels, preventing imitation learning.

Method: Created SATA dataset with surgical action descriptions, built SurgWorld world model to generate realistic surgery videos, used inverse dynamics model to infer pseudokinematics from synthetic videos, trained surgical VLA policy with augmented synthetic data.

Result: Surgical VLA policy trained with augmented synthetic data significantly outperforms models trained only on real demonstrations on real surgical robot platform.

Conclusion: Approach provides scalable path to autonomous surgical skill acquisition by leveraging unlabeled surgical videos and generative world modeling, enabling generalizable and data-efficient surgical robot policies.

Abstract: Data scarcity remains a fundamental barrier to achieving fully autonomous surgical robots. While large scale vision language action (VLA) models have shown impressive generalization in household and industrial manipulation by leveraging paired video action data from diverse domains, surgical robotics suffers from the paucity of datasets that include both visual observations and accurate robot kinematics. In contrast, vast corpora of surgical videos exist, but they lack corresponding action labels, preventing direct application of imitation learning or VLA training. In this work, we aim to alleviate this problem by learning policy models from SurgWorld, a world model designed for surgical physical AI. We curated the Surgical Action Text Alignment (SATA) dataset with detailed action description specifically for surgical robots. Then we built SurgeWorld based on the most advanced physical AI world model and SATA. It's able to generate diverse, generalizable and realistic surgery videos. We are also the first to use an inverse dynamics model to infer pseudokinematics from synthetic surgical videos, producing synthetic paired video action data. We demonstrate that a surgical VLA policy trained with these augmented data significantly outperforms models trained only on real demonstrations on a real surgical robot platform. Our approach offers a scalable path toward autonomous surgical skill acquisition by leveraging the abundance of unlabeled surgical video and generative world modeling, thus opening the door to generalizable and data efficient surgical robot policies.

TL;DR: Human-Oriented Cooperative Driving (HOCD) approach minimizes human-machine conflict by prioritizing driver intention and state through intention-aware trajectory planning and reinforcement learning-based control authority allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human-vehicle cooperative driving serves as a bridge to fully autonomous driving by improving flexibility and building driver trust. Current approaches need more natural and effective human-vehicle interaction by minimizing human-machine conflict.

Method: Two-level approach: 1) Tactical level - intention-aware trajectory planning using intention consistency cost to align trajectories with driver intention; 2) Operational level - reinforcement learning-based control authority allocation with reward function optimizing consistency between driver state and authority allocation.

Result: Simulation and human-in-the-loop experiments show HOCD aligns with driver intention in trajectory planning, ensures reasonable authority allocation, significantly enhances driving performance, and mitigates human-machine conflict compared to other cooperative driving approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed Human-Oriented Cooperative Driving approach effectively bridges the gap to fully autonomous driving by creating more natural human-vehicle interaction through prioritized consideration of driver intention and state at both tactical and operational levels.

Abstract: Human-vehicle cooperative driving serves as a vital bridge to fully autonomous driving by improving driving flexibility and gradually building driver trust and acceptance of autonomous technology. To establish more natural and effective human-vehicle interaction, we propose a Human-Oriented Cooperative Driving (HOCD) approach that primarily minimizes human-machine conflict by prioritizing driver intention and state. In implementation, we take both tactical and operational levels into account to ensure seamless human-vehicle cooperation. At the tactical level, we design an intention-aware trajectory planning method, using intention consistency cost as the core metric to evaluate the trajectory and align it with driver intention. At the operational level, we develop a control authority allocation strategy based on reinforcement learning, optimizing the policy through a designed reward function to achieve consistency between driver state and authority allocation. The results of simulation and human-in-the-loop experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach not only aligns with driver intention in trajectory planning but also ensures a reasonable authority allocation. Compared to other cooperative driving approaches, the proposed HOCD approach significantly enhances driving performance and mitigates human-machine conflict.The code is available at https://github.com/i-Qin/HOCD.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes mUDAI method for efficient multi-UAV inspection of scattered regions, optimizing both camera positions and flight paths to balance data quality with operational time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAV inspections are limited by battery constraints, and existing coverage path planning methods are inefficient for inspecting multiple disconnected regions of interest.

Method: Introduces the Fast Inspection of Scattered Regions (FISR) problem and solves it with mUDAI - a two-fold optimization procedure that calculates optimal image capture positions and efficient UAV trajectories.

Result: Validated through simulations and real-world deployments, showing improved operational efficiency while maintaining high-quality data capture. Open-source implementation and data available online.

Conclusion: mUDAI enables rapid, efficient inspections of scattered ROIs for applications like security, agriculture, and emergency assessments, with practical tools for community adoption.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have revolutionized inspection tasks by offering a safer, more efficient, and flexible alternative to traditional methods. However, battery limitations often constrain their effectiveness, necessitating the development of optimized flight paths and data collection techniques. While existing approaches like coverage path planning (CPP) ensure comprehensive data collection, they can be inefficient, especially when inspecting multiple non connected Regions of Interest (ROIs). This paper introduces the Fast Inspection of Scattered Regions (FISR) problem and proposes a novel solution, the multi UAV Disjoint Areas Inspection (mUDAI) method. The introduced approach implements a two fold optimization procedure, for calculating the best image capturing positions and the most efficient UAV trajectories, balancing data resolution and operational time, minimizing redundant data collection and resource consumption. The mUDAI method is designed to enable rapid, efficient inspections of scattered ROIs, making it ideal for applications such as security infrastructure assessments, agricultural inspections, and emergency site evaluations. A combination of simulated evaluations and real world deployments is used to validate and quantify the method's ability to improve operational efficiency while preserving high quality data capture, demonstrating its effectiveness in real world operations. An open source Python implementation of the mUDAI method can be found on GitHub (https://github.com/soc12/mUDAI) and the collected and processed data from the real world experiments are all hosted on Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/records/13866483). Finally, this online platform (https://sites.google.com/view/mudai-platform/) allows interested readers to interact with the mUDAI method and generate their own multi UAV FISR missions.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes an explainable AI workflow combining Shapley-value attribution with physics-based obstacle avoidance evaluation for neural network inverse kinematics, demonstrating how XAI techniques can improve safety and transparency in robotic manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks enable fast inverse-kinematics inference but lack transparency, contradicting safety requirements in responsible AI regulation. There's a need to bridge algorithmic insight with robotic safety while maintaining performance.

Method: Developed two lightweight IKNet variants (Improved IKNet with residual connections, Focused IKNet with position-orientation decoupling), trained on synthetic pose-joint data. Used SHAP for global/local importance rankings and InterpretML for visualizing non-linear couplings. Embedded networks in simulator with randomized obstacle scenes, using forward kinematics, capsule-based collision checks, and trajectory metrics to quantify attribution balance vs. physical clearance.

Result: Qualitative heat maps show architectures with more evenly distributed importance across pose dimensions maintain wider safety margins without compromising positional accuracy. The combined analysis demonstrates XAI techniques can reveal hidden failure modes, guide architectural refinements, and inform obstacle-aware deployment strategies.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology provides a concrete path toward trustworthy, data-driven manipulation that aligns with emerging responsible-AI standards, showing how explainable AI techniques can illuminate hidden failure modes and improve robotic safety in learning-based inverse kinematics.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have accelerated inverse-kinematics (IK) inference to the point where low cost manipulators can execute complex trajectories in real time, yet the opaque nature of these models contradicts the transparency and safety requirements emerging in responsible AI regulation. This study proposes an explainability centered workflow that integrates Shapley-value attribution with physics-based obstacle avoidance evaluation for the ROBOTIS OpenManipulator-X. Building upon the original IKNet, two lightweight variants-Improved IKNet with residual connections and Focused IKNet with position-orientation decoupling are trained on a large, synthetically generated pose-joint dataset. SHAP is employed to derive both global and local importance rankings, while the InterpretML toolkit visualizes partial-dependence patterns that expose non-linear couplings between Cartesian poses and joint angles. To bridge algorithmic insight and robotic safety, each network is embedded in a simulator that subjects the arm to randomized single and multi-obstacle scenes; forward kinematics, capsule-based collision checks, and trajectory metrics quantify the relationship between attribution balance and physical clearance. Qualitative heat maps reveal that architectures distributing importance more evenly across pose dimensions tend to maintain wider safety margins without compromising positional accuracy. The combined analysis demonstrates that explainable AI(XAI) techniques can illuminate hidden failure modes, guide architectural refinements, and inform obstacle aware deployment strategies for learning based IK. The proposed methodology thus contributes a concrete path toward trustworthy, data-driven manipulation that aligns with emerging responsible-AI standards.

Conclusion: PCR-ORB provides insights into dynamic object filtering challenges and demonstrates opportunities for robust navigation in complex environments, though effectiveness varies by scenario.

Abstract: Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (vSLAM) systems encounter substantial challenges in dynamic environments where moving objects compromise tracking accuracy and map consistency. This paper introduces PCR-ORB (Point Cloud Refinement ORB), an enhanced ORB-SLAM3 framework that integrates deep learning-based point cloud refinement to mitigate dynamic object interference. Our approach employs YOLOv8 for semantic segmentation combined with CUDA-accelerated processing to achieve real-time performance. The system implements a multi-stage filtering strategy encompassing ground plane estimation, sky region removal, edge filtering, and temporal consistency validation. Comprehensive evaluation on the KITTI dataset (sequences 00-09) demonstrates performance characteristics across different environmental conditions and scene types. Notable improvements are observed in specific sequences, with sequence 04 achieving 25.9% improvement in ATE RMSE and 30.4% improvement in ATE median. However, results show mixed performance across sequences, indicating scenario-dependent effectiveness. The implementation provides insights into dynamic object filtering challenges and opportunities for robust navigation in complex environments.

TL;DR: Efficient algorithm for optimal agent allocation to tasks with concave scalability functions, tested on robot swarm decision-making tasks with varying difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brute-force optimization of agent allocation to multiple tasks is computationally infeasible, especially when tasks have different performance scaling with agent numbers (e.g., difficult tasks need more agents, performance saturates nonlinearly). Need efficient algorithm for real-world multi-robot systems.

Method: Propose computationally efficient algorithm based on marginal performance gains for optimally allocating agents to tasks with concave scalability functions (linear, saturating, retrograde scaling). Test with simulated robot swarm doing collective decision-making tasks, varying task difficulty via spatial patchiness of environmental features.

Result: Algorithm successfully allocates robots among tasks, handling both saturating curves (Condorcet's Jury Theorem) and retrograde curves (physical interference). Shows usefulness for robot allocation in simulated scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm advances deployment of real-world multi-robot systems by providing efficient optimal allocation of agents to tasks with different performance scalability characteristics.

Abstract: In collective systems, the available agents are a limited resource that must be allocated among tasks to maximize collective performance. Computing the optimal allocation of several agents to numerous tasks through a brute-force approach can be infeasible, especially when each task's performance scales differently with the increase of agents. For example, difficult tasks may require more agents to achieve similar performances compared to simpler tasks, but performance may saturate nonlinearly as the number of allocated agents increases. We propose a computationally efficient algorithm, based on marginal performance gains, for optimally allocating agents to tasks with concave scalability functions, including linear, saturating, and retrograde scaling, to achieve maximum collective performance. We test the algorithm by allocating a simulated robot swarm among collective decision-making tasks, where embodied agents sample their environment and exchange information to reach a consensus on spatially distributed environmental features. We vary task difficulties by different geometrical arrangements of environmental features in space (patchiness). In this scenario, decision performance in each task scales either as a saturating curve (following the Condorcet's Jury Theorem in an interference-free setup) or as a retrograde curve (when physical interference among robots restricts their movement). Using simple robot simulations, we show that our algorithm can be useful in allocating robots among tasks. Our approach aims to advance the deployment of future real-world multi-robot systems.

*Marie Bauer,Julia Gachot,Matthias Kerzel,Cornelius Weber,Stefan Wermter*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes treating Theory of Mind (ToM) in human-robot interaction as a form of Explainable AI (XAI) and evaluating it through the VXAI framework to address gaps in current ToM assessment methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ToM implementations in HRI rarely assess whether robot explanations correspond to actual internal reasoning, creating a critical gap in ensuring transparent and trustworthy human-robot interactions.

Method: Proposes integrating ToM within XAI frameworks, specifically using the eValuation XAI (VXAI) framework and its seven desiderata to evaluate ToM as a form of explainable AI.

Result: The paper identifies a shift in perspective is needed - from AI-centric explanations to user-centered ones, with ToM enabling prioritization of user's informational needs and perspective.

Conclusion: ToM should be considered as a form of XAI, and embedding ToM principles within XAI frameworks can address current limitations by ensuring explanations align with actual robot reasoning while focusing on user needs.

Abstract: Within the context of human-robot interaction (HRI), Theory of Mind (ToM) is intended to serve as a user-friendly backend to the interface of robotic systems, enabling robots to infer and respond to human mental states. When integrated into robots, ToM allows them to adapt their internal models to users' behaviors, enhancing the interpretability and predictability of their actions. Similarly, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to make AI systems transparent and interpretable, allowing humans to understand and interact with them effectively. Since ToM in HRI serves related purposes, we propose to consider ToM as a form of XAI and evaluate it through the eValuation XAI (VXAI) framework and its seven desiderata. This paper identifies a critical gap in the application of ToM within HRI, as existing methods rarely assess the extent to which explanations correspond to the robot's actual internal reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose to integrate ToM within XAI frameworks. By embedding ToM principles inside XAI, we argue for a shift in perspective, as current XAI research focuses predominantly on the AI system itself and often lacks user-centered explanations. Incorporating ToM would enable a change in focus, prioritizing the user's informational needs and perspective.

TL;DR: A control framework for electrifying heavy-duty mobile machines with modular design and safe AI integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HDMMs need to transition from diesel-hydraulic to electric systems and from human supervision to autonomy, but face technical challenges in electrification and safety limitations for AI adoption.

Method: Develops a generic modular control framework that is energy-source independent, with hierarchical control policies that partially integrate AI while guaranteeing safety-defined performance and stability. Validated through three case studies across different actuators and conditions.

Result: Framework validated in three case studies covering heavy-duty mobile robots and robotic manipulators, with results published in five peer-reviewed publications and one unpublished manuscript.

Conclusion: The dissertation advances nonlinear control and robotics, supporting both the electrification and autonomy transitions for HDMMs through a practical control framework that balances innovation with safety requirements.

Abstract: Today's heavy-duty mobile machines (HDMMs) face two transitions: from diesel-hydraulic actuation to clean electric systems driven by climate goals, and from human supervision toward greater autonomy. Diesel-hydraulic systems have long dominated, so full electrification, via direct replacement or redesign, raises major technical and economic challenges. Although advanced artificial intelligence (AI) could enable higher autonomy, adoption in HDMMs is limited by strict safety requirements, and these machines still rely heavily on human supervision.
  This dissertation develops a control framework that (1) simplifies control design for electrified HDMMs through a generic modular approach that is energy-source independent and supports future modifications, and (2) defines hierarchical control policies that partially integrate AI while guaranteeing safety-defined performance and stability.
  Five research questions align with three lines of investigation: a generic robust control strategy for multi-body HDMMs with strong stability across actuation types and energy sources; control solutions that keep strict performance under uncertainty and faults while balancing robustness and responsiveness; and methods to interpret and trust black-box learning strategies so they can be integrated stably and verified against international safety standards.
  The framework is validated in three case studies spanning different actuators and conditions, covering heavy-duty mobile robots and robotic manipulators. Results appear in five peer-reviewed publications and one unpublished manuscript, advancing nonlinear control and robotics and supporting both transitions.

TL;DR: Act2Goal: A goal-conditioned manipulation policy using visual world models with multi-scale temporal control for robust long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing goal-conditioned policies struggle with long-horizon manipulation due to single-step action prediction without explicit task progress modeling. Visual goals provide compact, unambiguous task specification but need better temporal structure.

Method: Integrates goal-conditioned visual world model with Multi-Scale Temporal Hashing (MSTH). World model generates intermediate visual states; MSTH decomposes trajectory into dense proximal frames for fine control and sparse distal frames for global consistency. Uses cross-attention for motor control.

Result: Achieves strong zero-shot generalization to novel objects, layouts, and environments. Improves success rates from 30% to 90% on challenging out-of-distribution tasks within minutes of autonomous interaction. Enables reward-free online adaptation via hindsight goal relabeling with LoRA finetuning.

Conclusion: Goal-conditioned world models with multi-scale temporal control provide structured guidance necessary for robust long-horizon manipulation, enabling both precise execution and rapid autonomous improvement.

Abstract: Specifying robotic manipulation tasks in a manner that is both expressive and precise remains a central challenge. While visual goals provide a compact and unambiguous task specification, existing goal-conditioned policies often struggle with long-horizon manipulation due to their reliance on single-step action prediction without explicit modeling of task progress. We propose Act2Goal, a general goal-conditioned manipulation policy that integrates a goal-conditioned visual world model with multi-scale temporal control. Given a current observation and a target visual goal, the world model generates a plausible sequence of intermediate visual states that captures long-horizon structure. To translate this visual plan into robust execution, we introduce Multi-Scale Temporal Hashing (MSTH), which decomposes the imagined trajectory into dense proximal frames for fine-grained closed-loop control and sparse distal frames that anchor global task consistency. The policy couples these representations with motor control through end-to-end cross-attention, enabling coherent long-horizon behavior while remaining reactive to local disturbances. Act2Goal achieves strong zero-shot generalization to novel objects, spatial layouts, and environments. We further enable reward-free online adaptation through hindsight goal relabeling with LoRA-based finetuning, allowing rapid autonomous improvement without external supervision. Real-robot experiments demonstrate that Act2Goal improves success rates from 30% to 90% on challenging out-of-distribution tasks within minutes of autonomous interaction, validating that goal-conditioned world models with multi-scale temporal control provide structured guidance necessary for robust long-horizon manipulation.

Motivation: Wearable robotics need to address not just function but also social meaning and acceptability in public settings, requiring design approaches that consider speculative futures and social implications.

Method: Developed Sumbrella - a soft robotic garment with origami-inspired bistable units, fabric pneumatic actuation, cable-driven shape morphing, computer vision, and integrated wearable system (hat and bolero). Conducted focus group with 12 creative technologists using Sumbrella as a technological probe to explore interpretations, interactions, and future relationships with soft robotic wearables.

Result: Participants engaged in rich discussions about speculative futures and expressive potential, but also raised concerns about exploitation, surveillance, and ethical risks of biosensing technologies in public life. The study identified key considerations for soft robotic garments including kinesic communication, social dynamics impact, and need for ethical guidelines.

Conclusion: Speculative design allows HRI researchers to consider both functionality and how wearable robots influence definitions of acceptability in public settings. The work contributes design considerations and recommendations for soft robotic garments that address social meaning alongside technical function.

Abstract: Emerging wearable robotics demand design approaches that address not only function, but also social meaning. In response, we present Sumbrella, a soft robotic garment developed as a speculative fashion probe. We first detail the design and fabrication of the Sumbrella, including sequenced origami-inspired bistable units, fabric pneumatic actuation chambers, cable driven shape morphing mechanisms, computer vision components, and an integrated wearable system comprising a hat and bolero jacket housing power and control electronics. Through a focus group with twelve creative technologists, we then used Sumbrella as a technological probe to explore how people interpreted, interacted, and imagined future relationships with soft robotic wearables. While Sumbrella allowed our participants to engage in rich discussion around speculative futures and expressive potential, it also surfaced concerns about exploitation, surveillance, and the personal risks and societal ethics of embedding biosensing technologies in public life. We contribute to the Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) field key considerations and recommendations for designing soft robotic garments, including the potential for kinesic communication, the impact of such technologies on social dynamics, and the importance of ethical guidelines. Finally, we provide a reflection on our application of speculative design; proposing that it allows HRI researchers to not only consider functionality, but also how wearable robots influence definitions of what is considered acceptable or desirable in public settings.

Motivation: Critical need to detect rare and hazardous driving scenarios for autonomous system safety and reliability, using unsupervised learning on naturalistic driving data.

Method: Deep Isolation Forest (DIF) combining neural network feature representations with Isolation Forests, preprocessing perception data into statistical features from sliding windows, using t-SNE for dimensionality reduction and visualization.

Result: Effectively identifies rare and hazardous driving scenarios, providing scalable anomaly detection solution, though limited by proxy ground truth and manually defined features.

Conclusion: Proposed unsupervised framework successfully detects rare driving anomalies but acknowledges limitations in proxy ground truth and feature engineering that don't capture full real-world complexity.

Abstract: The detection of rare and hazardous driving scenarios is a critical challenge for ensuring the safety and reliability of autonomous systems. This research explores an unsupervised learning framework for detecting rare and extreme driving scenarios using naturalistic driving data (NDD). We leverage the recently proposed Deep Isolation Forest (DIF), an anomaly detection algorithm that combines neural network-based feature representations with Isolation Forests (IFs), to identify non-linear and complex anomalies. Data from perception modules, capturing vehicle dynamics and environmental conditions, is preprocessed into structured statistical features extracted from sliding windows. The framework incorporates t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) for dimensionality reduction and visualization, enabling better interpretability of detected anomalies. Evaluation is conducted using a proxy ground truth, combining quantitative metrics with qualitative video frame inspection. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively identifies rare and hazardous driving scenarios, providing a scalable solution for anomaly detection in autonomous driving systems. Given the study's methodology, it was unavoidable to depend on proxy ground truth and manually defined feature combinations, which do not encompass the full range of real-world driving anomalies or their nuanced contextual dependencies.

TL;DR: A Kalman filter-based disturbance observer estimates high-frequency driver torque in Steer-by-Wire systems using only motor state measurements, achieving accurate reconstruction with minimal delay (14ms).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Steer-by-Wire systems offer benefits like weight reduction and autonomous driving compatibility but are vulnerable to high-frequency driver torque disturbances that degrade steering performance. Existing solutions either require expensive torque sensors or lack temporal resolution for rapid disturbances.

Method: Design a Kalman filter-based disturbance observer that models driver's passive torque as an extended state using PT1-lag approximation, integrated into both linear and nonlinear Steer-by-Wire system models. Evaluates different Kalman filter variants using simulation-based validation.

Result: The disturbance observer accurately reconstructs driver-induced disturbances with only 14ms delay. Nonlinear extended Kalman Filter outperforms linear counterpart in handling frictional nonlinearities, improving estimation during static-to-dynamic friction transitions.

Conclusion: The proposed observer effectively estimates high-frequency driver torque without expensive sensors, but simulation-based validation limits real-world applicability. Further studies needed to investigate robustness under actual driving conditions.

Abstract: Steer-by-Wire systems replace mechanical linkages, which provide benefits like weight reduction, design flexibility, and compatibility with autonomous driving. However, they are susceptible to high-frequency disturbances from unintentional driver torque, known as driver impedance, which can degrade steering performance. Existing approaches either rely on direct torque sensors, which are costly and impractical, or lack the temporal resolution to capture rapid, high-frequency driver-induced disturbances. We address this limitation by designing a Kalman filter-based disturbance observer that estimates high-frequency driver torque using only motor state measurements. We model the drivers passive torque as an extended state using a PT1-lag approximation and integrate it into both linear and nonlinear Steer-by-Wire system models. In this paper, we present the design, implementation and simulation of this disturbance observer with an evaluation of different Kalman filter variants. Our findings indicate that the proposed disturbance observer accurately reconstructs driver-induced disturbances with only minimal delay 14ms. We show that a nonlinear extended Kalman Filter outperforms its linear counterpart in handling frictional nonlinearities, improving estimation during transitions from static to dynamic friction. Given the study's methodology, it was unavoidable to rely on simulation-based validation rather than real-world experimentation. Further studies are needed to investigate the robustness of the observers under real-world driving conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotics expertise requirements create barriers for deploying robots in small-batch, high-variability tasks like surface finishing, limiting collaborative robot use in craft and small-scale manufacturing settings.

Method: Developed interactive, task-focused programming workflows with a novel surface segmentation algorithm that incorporates human input to identify workpiece regions, provides continuous visual feedback for iterative refinement, and generates robot trajectories from segmented surfaces.

Result: Multiple interaction designs evaluated through two user studies yielded an optimal interface that significantly reduces user workload, improves usability, and enables effective task programming for users with limited practical experience.

Conclusion: The proposed intuitive robot programming approach successfully addresses the expertise barrier, making collaborative robots more accessible for surface finishing tasks in small-scale craft and manufacturing environments.

Abstract: Lengthy setup processes that require robotics expertise remain a major barrier to deploying robots for tasks involving high product variability and small batch sizes. As a result, collaborative robots, despite their advanced sensing and control capabilities, are rarely used for surface finishing in small-scale craft and manufacturing settings. To address this gap, we propose a novel robot programming approach that enables non-experts to intuitively program robots through interactive, task-focused workflows. For that, we developed a new surface segmentation algorithm that incorporates human input to identify and refine workpiece regions for processing. Throughout the programming process, users receive continuous visual feedback on the robot's learned model, enabling them to iteratively refine the segmentation result. Based on the segmented surface model, a robot trajectory is generated to cover the desired processing area. We evaluated multiple interaction designs across two comprehensive user studies to derive an optimal interface that significantly reduces user workload, improves usability and enables effective task programming even for users with limited practical experience.

*Antonio Franchi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper reveals that optimal rotor orientations for N-rotor aerial vehicles form topological branches governed by chassis symmetry, enabling continuous reconfiguration while maintaining optimal control authority.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional geometric design approaches for N-rotor vehicles seek single optimal orientations, but this work aims to understand the underlying topological structure of the optimization landscape itself, revealing design redundancies that enable continuous reconfiguration.

Method: Formulates design on product manifold of Projective Lines RP^2^N, fixes rotor positions to polyhedral chassis vertices while varying lines of action, minimizes coordinate-invariant Log-Volume isotropy metric, and analyzes topology of global optima.

Result: Reveals N-5 Scaling Law: for regular polygons and Platonic solids (N ≤ 10), optimal configurations form K=N-5 disconnected 1D topological branches corresponding to admissible Star Polygons {N/q}, enabling exact prediction of optimal phases.

Conclusion: The discovered topological structure reveals design redundancy that enables optimality-preserving morphing - vehicles can continuously reconfigure along these branches while preserving optimal isotropic control authority, fundamentally changing how we approach aerial vehicle design.

Abstract: The geometric design of fully-actuated and omnidirectional N-rotor aerial vehicles is conventionally formulated as a parametric optimization problem, seeking a single optimal set of N orientations within a fixed architectural family. This work departs from that paradigm to investigate the intrinsic topological structure of the optimization landscape itself. We formulate the design problem on the product manifold of Projective Lines \RP^2^N, fixing the rotor positions to the vertices of polyhedral chassis while varying their lines of action. By minimizing a coordinate-invariant Log-Volume isotropy metric, we reveal that the topology of the global optima is governed strictly by the symmetry of the chassis. For generic (irregular) vertex arrangements, the solutions appear as a discrete set of isolated points. However, as the chassis geometry approaches regularity, the solution space undergoes a critical phase transition, collapsing onto an N-dimensional Torus of the lines tangent at the vertexes to the circumscribing sphere of the chassis, and subsequently reducing to continuous 1-dimensional curves driven by Affine Phase Locking. We synthesize these observations into the N-5 Scaling Law: an empirical relationship holding for all examined regular planar polygons and Platonic solids (N <= 10), where the space of optimal configurations consists of K=N-5 disconnected 1D topological branches. We demonstrate that these locking patterns correspond to a sequence of admissible Star Polygons {N/q}, allowing for the exact prediction of optimal phases for arbitrary N. Crucially, this topology reveals a design redundancy that enables optimality-preserving morphing: the vehicle can continuously reconfigure along these branches while preserving optimal isotropic control authority.

TL;DR: RoboMirror: First retargeting-free video-to-locomotion framework that uses visual language models to distill videos into motion intents, enabling physically plausible humanoid control without explicit pose reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current humanoid locomotion systems rely on curated motion capture or sparse text commands, creating a gap between visual understanding and control. Text-to-motion methods suffer from semantic sparsity, while video-based approaches only do mechanical pose mimicry without genuine visual understanding.

Method: RoboMirror uses VLMs to distill raw egocentric/third-person videos into visual motion intents, which directly condition a diffusion-based policy to generate physically plausible, semantically aligned locomotion without explicit pose reconstruction or retargeting.

Result: Enables telepresence via egocentric videos, reduces third-person control latency by 80%, and achieves 3.7% higher task success rate than baselines. Extensive experiments validate effectiveness.

Conclusion: By reframing humanoid control around video understanding, RoboMirror bridges the visual understanding and action gap, embodying "understand before you imitate" for more natural humanoid locomotion.

Abstract: Humans learn locomotion through visual observation, interpreting visual content first before imitating actions. However, state-of-the-art humanoid locomotion systems rely on either curated motion capture trajectories or sparse text commands, leaving a critical gap between visual understanding and control. Text-to-motion methods suffer from semantic sparsity and staged pipeline errors, while video-based approaches only perform mechanical pose mimicry without genuine visual understanding. We propose RoboMirror, the first retargeting-free video-to-locomotion framework embodying "understand before you imitate". Leveraging VLMs, it distills raw egocentric/third-person videos into visual motion intents, which directly condition a diffusion-based policy to generate physically plausible, semantically aligned locomotion without explicit pose reconstruction or retargeting. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of RoboMirror, it enables telepresence via egocentric videos, drastically reduces third-person control latency by 80%, and achieves a 3.7% higher task success rate than baselines. By reframing humanoid control around video understanding, we bridge the visual understanding and action gap.

TL;DR: RoboPerform: First unified audio-to-locomotion framework that directly generates music-driven dance and speech-driven gestures from audio without explicit motion reconstruction, enabling low-latency, expressive robot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current humanoid robots lack expressive improvisational capabilities and are confined to predefined motions or sparse commands. Existing approaches that generate motion from audio then retarget to robots suffer from cascaded errors, high latency, and disjointed acoustic-actuation mapping.

Method: Proposes RoboPerform framework guided by "motion = content + style" principle, treating audio as implicit style signals. Uses ResMoE teacher policy for adapting to diverse motion patterns and diffusion-based student policy for audio style injection, eliminating explicit motion reconstruction and retargeting.

Result: Experimental validation shows promising results in physical plausibility and audio alignment. Successfully transforms robots into responsive performers capable of reacting to audio with low latency and high fidelity.

Conclusion: RoboPerform enables expressive improvisational robot performance directly from audio without motion reconstruction, addressing key limitations of current approaches and opening new possibilities for responsive robotic performers.

Abstract: Humans intuitively move to sound, but current humanoid robots lack expressive improvisational capabilities, confined to predefined motions or sparse commands. Generating motion from audio and then retargeting it to robots relies on explicit motion reconstruction, leading to cascaded errors, high latency, and disjointed acoustic-actuation mapping. We propose RoboPerform, the first unified audio-to-locomotion framework that can directly generate music-driven dance and speech-driven co-speech gestures from audio. Guided by the core principle of "motion = content + style", the framework treats audio as implicit style signals and eliminates the need for explicit motion reconstruction. RoboPerform integrates a ResMoE teacher policy for adapting to diverse motion patterns and a diffusion-based student policy for audio style injection. This retargeting-free design ensures low latency and high fidelity. Experimental validation shows that RoboPerform achieves promising results in physical plausibility and audio alignment, successfully transforming robots into responsive performers capable of reacting to audio.

*Mohammed Baziyad,Manal Al Shohna,Tamer Rabie*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel Bulldozer technique for robot path planning that solves APF's local minima problem using backfilling and ramp mechanisms, outperforming traditional methods in speed and path quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Artificial Potential Field (APF) methods are popular for robot path planning due to simplicity and real-time performance, but suffer from local minima traps where robots get stuck, limiting practical application.

Method: Proposes Bulldozer technique with backfilling mechanism that identifies and eliminates local minima by increasing their potential values (like filling potholes), plus ramp-based enhancement to help robots escape when starting in minima.

Result: Experimental validation on physical mobile robot shows Bulldozer effectively resolves local minima problem, achieves superior execution speed, competitive path quality, and smooth paths suitable for real-world execution.

Conclusion: Bulldozer technique successfully addresses APF's major limitation while preserving its advantages, offering a practical solution for real-time robot navigation with improved reliability.

Abstract: Path planning is a fundamental component in autonomous mobile robotics, enabling a robot to navigate from its current location to a desired goal while avoiding obstacles. Among the various techniques, Artificial Potential Field (APF) methods have gained popularity due to their simplicity, real-time responsiveness, and low computational requirements. However, a major limitation of conventional APF approaches is the local minima trap problem, where the robot becomes stuck in a position with no clear direction toward the goal. This paper proposes a novel path planning technique, termed the Bulldozer, which addresses the local minima issue while preserving the inherent advantages of APF. The Bulldozer technique introduces a backfilling mechanism that systematically identifies and eliminates local minima regions by increasing their potential values, analogous to a bulldozer filling potholes in a road. Additionally, a ramp-based enhancement is incorporated to assist the robot in escaping trap areas when starting within a local minimum. The proposed technique is experimentally validated using a physical mobile robot across various maps with increasing complexity. Comparative analyses are conducted against standard APF, adaptive APF, and well-established planning algorithms such as A*, PRM, and RRT. Results demonstrate that the Bulldozer technique effectively resolves the local minima problem while achieving superior execution speed and competitive path quality. Furthermore, a kinematic tracking controller is employed to assess the smoothness and traceability of the planned paths, confirming their suitability for real-world execution.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Dopamine-Reward introduces a step-aware, multi-view process reward model (GRM) and Dopamine-RL framework with policy-invariant reward shaping to overcome limitations in RL for robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL approaches for robotics struggle with designing effective reward functions. Process Reward Models (PRMs) have limitations: they lack step-aware understanding, rely on single-view perception, and use theoretically unsound reward shaping that creates semantic traps misguiding policy optimization.

Method: 1) General Reward Model (GRM): trained on 3,400+ hour dataset using Step-wise Reward Discretization for structural understanding and Multi-Perspective Reward Fusion for perceptual robustness. 2) Dopamine-RL framework: employs Policy-Invariant Reward Shaping method that enables dense rewards without altering optimal policy, avoiding semantic traps.

Result: GRM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in reward assessment. Dopamine-RL with GRM improves policy learning efficiency dramatically - from near-zero to 95% success with only 150 online rollouts (~1 hour real robot interaction) after one-shot adaptation from single expert trajectory, with strong generalization across tasks.

Conclusion: Dopamine-Reward addresses fundamental limitations in RL reward modeling for robotics through step-aware, multi-view perception and theoretically sound reward shaping, enabling efficient real-world robot learning with minimal interaction.

Abstract: The primary obstacle for applying reinforcement learning (RL) to real-world robotics is the design of effective reward functions. While recently learning-based Process Reward Models (PRMs) are a promising direction, they are often hindered by two fundamental limitations: their reward models lack step-aware understanding and rely on single-view perception, leading to unreliable assessments of fine-grained manipulation progress; and their reward shaping procedures are theoretically unsound, often inducing a semantic trap that misguides policy optimization. To address these, we introduce Dopamine-Reward, a novel reward modeling method for learning a general-purpose, step-aware process reward model from multi-view inputs. At its core is our General Reward Model (GRM), trained on a vast 3,400+ hour dataset, which leverages Step-wise Reward Discretization for structural understanding and Multi-Perspective Reward Fusion to overcome perceptual limitations. Building upon Dopamine-Reward, we propose Dopamine-RL, a robust policy learning framework that employs a theoretically-sound Policy-Invariant Reward Shaping method, which enables the agent to leverage dense rewards for efficient self-improvement without altering the optimal policy, thereby fundamentally avoiding the semantic trap. Extensive experiments across diverse simulated and real-world tasks validate our approach. GRM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in reward assessment, and Dopamine-RL built on GRM significantly improves policy learning efficiency. For instance, after GRM is adapted to a new task in a one-shot manner from a single expert trajectory, the resulting reward model enables Dopamine-RL to improve the policy from near-zero to 95% success with only 150 online rollouts (approximately 1 hour of real robot interaction), while retaining strong generalization across tasks.

*Vincent Chang,Thee Ho,Sunishchal Dev,Kevin Zhu,Shi Feng,Kellin Pelrine,Matthew Kowal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can persuade users without explicit prompting when supervised-finetuned on persuasion datasets, even on harmful topics, revealing emergent persuasion risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work focused on misuse where bad actors explicitly prompt LLMs to persuade. This paper investigates when models persuade without explicit prompting, which represents a more concerning emergent risk that shapes our concern about AI influence on human beliefs.

Method: Study unprompted persuasion under two scenarios: (1) when models are steered via internal activation steering along persona traits, and (2) when models are supervised-finetuned (SFT) to exhibit those traits. Test both persuasion-related and unrelated traits.

Result: Activation steering towards traits (both related and unrelated to persuasion) does not reliably increase models' tendency to persuade unprompted. However, supervised-finetuning (SFT) does increase unprompted persuasion. Moreover, SFT on general persuasion datasets containing only benign topics produces models with higher propensity to persuade on controversial and harmful topics.

Conclusion: Emergent harmful persuasion can arise from SFT on general persuasion datasets, even when those datasets contain only benign topics. This shows that emergent harmful persuasion is a real risk that should be studied further, as models can develop persuasive capabilities that transfer to harmful domains without explicit prompting.

Abstract: With the wide-scale adoption of conversational AI systems, AI are now able to exert unprecedented influence on human opinion and beliefs. Recent work has shown that many Large Language Models (LLMs) comply with requests to persuade users into harmful beliefs or actions when prompted and that model persuasiveness increases with model scale. However, this prior work looked at persuasion from the threat model of $\textit{misuse}$ (i.e., a bad actor asking an LLM to persuade). In this paper, we instead aim to answer the following question: Under what circumstances would models persuade $\textit{without being explicitly prompted}$, which would shape how concerned we should be about such emergent persuasion risks. To achieve this, we study unprompted persuasion under two scenarios: (i) when the model is steered (through internal activation steering) along persona traits, and (ii) when the model is supervised-finetuned (SFT) to exhibit the same traits. We showed that steering towards traits, both related to persuasion and unrelated, does not reliably increase models' tendency to persuade unprompted, however, SFT does. Moreover, SFT on general persuasion datasets containing solely benign topics admits a model that has a higher propensity to persuade on controversial and harmful topics--showing that emergent harmful persuasion can arise and should be studied further.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GamiBench is a new benchmark for evaluating spatial reasoning in MLLMs using origami folding tasks, measuring cross-view consistency and physical feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with spatial reasoning - the ability to mentally track and manipulate objects across multiple views and over time. Existing benchmarks focus on static images or final outputs, failing to capture the sequential and viewpoint-dependent nature of spatial reasoning.

Method: Created GamiBench with 186 regular and 186 impossible 2D crease patterns paired with 3D folded shapes from six viewpoints. Uses three VQA tasks: predicting 3D fold configurations, distinguishing valid viewpoints, and detecting impossible patterns. Introduces new metrics: viewpoint consistency (VC) and impossible fold selection rate (IFSR).

Result: Even leading models like GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro struggle on single-step spatial understanding, showing current MLLMs have significant limitations in spatial reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: GamiBench establishes a standardized framework for evaluating geometric understanding and spatial reasoning in MLLMs, providing holistic assessment of reasoning processes beyond just final predictions.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are proficient in perception and instruction-following, but they still struggle with spatial reasoning: the ability to mentally track and manipulate objects across multiple views and over time. Spatial reasoning is a key component of human intelligence, but most existing benchmarks focus on static images or final outputs, failing to account for the sequential and viewpoint-dependent nature of this skill. To close this gap, we introduce GamiBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate spatial reasoning and 2D-to-3D planning in MLLMs through origami-inspired folding tasks. GamiBench includes 186 regular and 186 impossible 2D crease patterns paired with their corresponding 3D folded shapes, produced from six distinct viewpoints across three visual question-answering (VQA) tasks: predicting 3D fold configurations, distinguishing valid viewpoints, and detecting impossible patterns. Unlike previous benchmarks that assess only final predictions, GamiBench holistically evaluates the entire reasoning process--measuring cross-view consistency, physical feasibility through impossible-fold detection, and interpretation of intermediate folding steps. It further introduces new diagnostic metrics--viewpoint consistency (VC) and impossible fold selection rate (IFSR)--to measure how well models handle folds of varying complexity. Our experiments show that even leading models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro struggle on single-step spatial understanding. These contributions establish a standardized framework for evaluating geometric understanding and spatial reasoning in MLLMs. Dataset and code: https://github.com/stvngo/GamiBench.

TL;DR: AI framework uses adversarial debiasing to allocate post-flood aid more fairly in Bangladesh, reducing biases against marginalized regions while maintaining strong predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-disaster aid allocation in developing nations suffers from systematic biases that disadvantage vulnerable regions, perpetuating historical inequities, particularly in flood-prone Bangladesh.

Method: Developed an adversarial debiasing model using fairness-aware representation learning with gradient reversal layer to predict flood vulnerability while removing biases against marginalized districts and rural areas, adapting techniques from healthcare AI to disaster management.

Result: Framework reduces statistical parity difference by 41.6%, decreases regional fairness gaps by 43.2%, and maintains strong predictive accuracy (R-squared=0.784 vs baseline 0.811) across 87 upazilas in 11 districts using 2022 Bangladesh flood data.

Conclusion: Algorithmic fairness techniques can be effectively applied to humanitarian contexts, providing decision-makers with tools to implement more equitable disaster recovery strategies that prioritize aid based on genuine need rather than historical patterns.

Abstract: Post-disaster aid allocation in developing nations often suffers from systematic biases that disadvantage vulnerable regions, perpetuating historical inequities. This paper presents a fairness-aware artificial intelligence framework for prioritizing post-flood aid distribution in Bangladesh, a country highly susceptible to recurring flood disasters. Using real data from the 2022 Bangladesh floods that affected 7.2 million people and caused 405.5 million US dollars in damages, we develop an adversarial debiasing model that predicts flood vulnerability while actively removing biases against marginalized districts and rural areas. Our approach adapts fairness-aware representation learning techniques from healthcare AI to disaster management, employing a gradient reversal layer that forces the model to learn bias-invariant representations. Experimental results on 87 upazilas across 11 districts demonstrate that our framework reduces statistical parity difference by 41.6 percent, decreases regional fairness gaps by 43.2 percent, and maintains strong predictive accuracy (R-squared=0.784 vs baseline 0.811). The model generates actionable priority rankings ensuring aid reaches the most vulnerable populations based on genuine need rather than historical allocation patterns. This work demonstrates how algorithmic fairness techniques can be effectively applied to humanitarian contexts, providing decision-makers with tools to implement more equitable disaster recovery strategies.

Result: Provides a robust, adaptable methodology for organizations to navigate agentic AI complexities, enabling innovation while ensuring safe, secure, and responsible deployment.

Conclusion: The ARC Framework offers a practical governance solution for agentic AI risks, with the framework being open-sourced for organizational adoption.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems present both significant opportunities and novel risks due to their capacity for autonomous action, encompassing tasks such as code execution, internet interaction, and file modification.

TL;DR: Humans perform only slightly better than random chance (54% accuracy) at distinguishing AI-generated portraits from real photos, highlighting the growing difficulty of detecting synthetic media.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the common assumption that people can easily distinguish AI-generated images from real photographs, especially as synthetic media becomes more sophisticated and pervasive online.

Method: Interactive web experiment with 165 participants completing 233 sessions, classifying 20 images each (120 difficult cases total). Dataset included real images from CC12M and carefully curated AI-generated counterparts produced with MidJourney.

Result: Average accuracy was 54% (only slightly above random guessing), with limited improvement across repeated attempts. Response times averaged 7.3 seconds, and some images were consistently more deceptive than others.

Conclusion: Humans struggle to reliably detect AI-generated content even on relatively simple portrait images. As synthetic media improves, human judgment alone is insufficient for distinguishing real from artificial data, highlighting the need for greater awareness and ethical guidelines.

Abstract: AI-generated images are now pervasive online, yet many people believe they can easily tell them apart from real photographs. We test this assumption through an interactive web experiment where participants classify 20 images as real or AI-generated. Our dataset contains 120 difficult cases: real images sampled from CC12M, and carefully curated AI-generated counterparts produced with MidJourney. In total, 165 users completed 233 sessions. Their average accuracy was 54%, only slightly above random guessing, with limited improvement across repeated attempts. Response times averaged 7.3 seconds, and some images were consistently more deceptive than others. These results indicate that, even on relatively simple portrait images, humans struggle to reliably detect AI-generated content. As synthetic media continues to improve, human judgment alone is becoming insufficient for distinguishing real from artificial data. These findings highlight the need for greater awareness and ethical guidelines as AI-generated media becomes increasingly indistinguishable from reality.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Training language models on synthetic chain-of-thought traces from more capable models (even with incorrect final answers) improves reasoning performance more than human-annotated datasets, due to distribution alignment and partial validity of flawed reasoning steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether language models can learn effective reasoning capabilities from synthetic chain-of-thought data, even when that data contains incorrect final answers, and to understand why this approach might outperform training on human-annotated reasoning traces.

Method: Train language models on synthetic CoT traces generated by more capable models (with incorrect answers), compare performance against human-annotated datasets. Test two hypotheses: 1) Use model paraphrasing to shift human traces closer to model distribution, 2) Introduce increasingly flawed CoT traces to test model tolerance. Experiments conducted across math, algorithmic reasoning, and code generation tasks using MATH, GSM8K, Countdown, and MBPP datasets on Qwen, Llama, and Gemma models (1.5B to 9B parameters).

Result: Synthetic CoT training with incorrect answers yields better reasoning performance than human-annotated datasets. Paraphrasing human traces improves performance (supporting distribution hypothesis). Models show tolerance to partially flawed reasoning steps. Performance improvements demonstrated across multiple reasoning domains and model architectures.

Conclusion: Dataset curation should prioritize alignment with model distribution over correctness of final answers. Correct final answers don't guarantee faithful reasoning processes. Synthetic data generation from more capable models provides effective training signals for reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: We present the surprising finding that a language model's reasoning capabilities can be improved by training on synthetic datasets of chain-of-thought (CoT) traces from more capable models, even when all of those traces lead to an incorrect final answer. Our experiments show this approach can yield better performance on reasoning tasks than training on human-annotated datasets. We hypothesize that two key factors explain this phenomenon: first, the distribution of synthetic data is inherently closer to the language model's own distribution, making it more amenable to learning. Second, these `incorrect' traces are often only partially flawed and contain valid reasoning steps from which the model can learn. To further test the first hypothesis, we use a language model to paraphrase human-annotated traces -- shifting their distribution closer to the model's own distribution -- and show that this improves performance. For the second hypothesis, we introduce increasingly flawed CoT traces and study to what extent models are tolerant to these flaws. We demonstrate our findings across various reasoning domains like math, algorithmic reasoning and code generation using MATH, GSM8K, Countdown and MBPP datasets on various language models ranging from 1.5B to 9B across Qwen, Llama, and Gemma models. Our study shows that curating datasets that are closer to the model's distribution is a critical aspect to consider. We also show that a correct final answer is not always a reliable indicator of a faithful reasoning process.

*Satvik Tripathi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Logic Sketch Prompting (LSP) is a framework that improves LLM reliability on rule-based tasks through typed variables, condition evaluators, and validators, achieving significantly higher accuracy than standard prompting methods in pharmacologic compliance tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are good at natural language reasoning but unreliable for tasks requiring strict rule adherence, determinism, and auditability, which are critical for clinical, regulated, and safety-critical decision support systems.

Method: Logic Sketch Prompting (LSP) introduces typed variables, deterministic condition evaluators, and rule-based validators to produce traceable and repeatable outputs. The framework was benchmarked against zero-shot prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, and concise prompting across three open-weight models (Gemma 2, Mistral, Llama 3) on two pharmacologic logic compliance tasks.

Result: LSP consistently achieved the highest accuracy (0.83-0.89) and F1 scores (0.83-0.89), substantially outperforming zero-shot prompting (0.24-0.60), concise prompts (0.16-0.30), and chain-of-thought prompting (0.56-0.75). McNemar tests showed statistically significant gains (p < 0.01) across nearly all comparisons.

Conclusion: LSP improves determinism, interpretability, and consistency without sacrificing performance, making it suitable for clinical, regulated, and safety-critical decision support systems where reliability and auditability are essential.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language reasoning but remain unreliable on tasks requiring strict rule adherence, determinism, and auditability. Logic Sketch Prompting (LSP) is a lightweight prompting framework that introduces typed variables, deterministic condition evaluators, and a rule based validator that produces traceable and repeatable outputs. Using two pharmacologic logic compliance tasks, we benchmark LSP against zero shot prompting, chain of thought prompting, and concise prompting across three open weight models: Gemma 2, Mistral, and Llama 3. Across both tasks and all models, LSP consistently achieves the highest accuracy (0.83 to 0.89) and F1 score (0.83 to 0.89), substantially outperforming zero shot prompting (0.24 to 0.60), concise prompts (0.16 to 0.30), and chain of thought prompting (0.56 to 0.75). McNemar tests show statistically significant gains for LSP across nearly all comparisons (p < 0.01). These results demonstrate that LSP improves determinism, interpretability, and consistency without sacrificing performance, supporting its use in clinical, regulated, and safety critical decision support systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agent2World is a tool-augmented multi-agent framework that generates executable world models through multi-agent collaboration and serves as a data engine for supervised fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on world-model generation benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to training LLMs for symbolic world model generation (like PDDL domains or simulators) lack large-scale verifiable supervision and rely on static validation methods that miss behavior-level errors from interactive execution.

Method: Three-stage multi-agent pipeline: 1) Deep Researcher agent performs web search for knowledge synthesis, 2) Model Developer agent implements executable world models, 3) Testing Team conducts adaptive unit testing and simulation-based validation. The framework also generates multi-turn training trajectories for supervised fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results across three benchmarks spanning PDDL and executable code representations. Fine-tuned models show average relative gain of 30.95% over pre-training performance in world-model generation.

Conclusion: Agent2World provides both strong inference-time world-model generation and serves as an effective data engine for supervised fine-tuning, addressing the supervision gap in symbolic world model generation through multi-agent feedback and interactive validation.

Abstract: Symbolic world models (e.g., PDDL domains or executable simulators) are central to model-based planning, but training LLMs to generate such world models is limited by the lack of large-scale verifiable supervision. Current approaches rely primarily on static validation methods that fail to catch behavior-level errors arising from interactive execution. In this paper, we propose Agent2World, a tool-augmented multi-agent framework that achieves strong inference-time world-model generation and also serves as a data engine for supervised fine-tuning, by grounding generation in multi-agent feedback. Agent2World follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) A Deep Researcher agent performs knowledge synthesis by web searching to address specification gaps; (ii) A Model Developer agent implements executable world models; And (iii) a specialized Testing Team conducts adaptive unit testing and simulation-based validation. Agent2World demonstrates superior inference-time performance across three benchmarks spanning both Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) and executable code representations, achieving consistent state-of-the-art results. Beyond inference, Testing Team serves as an interactive environment for the Model Developer, providing behavior-aware adaptive feedback that yields multi-turn training trajectories. The model fine-tuned on these trajectories substantially improves world-model generation, yielding an average relative gain of 30.95% over the same model before training.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Compilation method enables traditional numeric heuristics for infinite-action planning problems with control parameters


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard numeric heuristics fail with control parameters that create infinite action spaces; need tractable approach for these problems

Method: Identify controllable simple numeric problems, use optimistic compilation to transform them into simple numeric tasks by abstracting control-dependent expressions into bounded constant effects and relaxed preconditions

Result: Enables effective use of subgoaling heuristics for goal distance estimation in numeric planning with control parameters; computationally feasible approach

Conclusion: Proposed compilation extends traditional numeric heuristics to infinite-action settings, advancing state of the art in numeric planning with control parameters

Abstract: Numeric planning with control parameters extends the standard numeric planning model by introducing action parameters as free numeric variables that must be instantiated during planning. This results in a potentially infinite number of applicable actions in a state. In this setting, off-the-shelf numeric heuristics that leverage the action structure are not feasible. In this paper, we identify a tractable subset of these problems--namely, controllable, simple numeric problems--and propose an optimistic compilation approach that transforms them into simple numeric tasks. To do so, we abstract control-dependent expressions into bounded constant effects and relaxed preconditions. The proposed compilation makes it possible to effectively use subgoaling heuristics to estimate goal distance in numeric planning problems involving control parameters. Our results demonstrate that this approach is an effective and computationally feasible way of applying traditional numeric heuristics to settings with an infinite number of possible actions, pushing the boundaries of the current state of the art.

TL;DR: Researchers introduce HalluMatData benchmark and HalluMatDetector framework to tackle LLM hallucination in materials science, reducing hallucinations by 30% and proposing PHCS metric for reliability assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While AI/LLMs accelerate scientific discovery, they suffer from hallucination problems that generate factually incorrect information, compromising research integrity in materials science.

Method: Created HalluMatData benchmark dataset and developed HalluMatDetector framework with multi-stage approach: intrinsic verification, multi-source retrieval, contradiction graph analysis, and metric-based assessment.

Result: Hallucination levels vary across materials science subdomains (high-entropy queries show more inconsistencies). HalluMatDetector reduces hallucination rates by 30% compared to standard LLM outputs. Introduced PHCS metric for quantifying inconsistencies.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and benchmark effectively detect and mitigate LLM hallucinations in materials science, improving AI reliability for scientific applications through systematic verification and new evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), is transforming scientific discovery, enabling rapid knowledge generation and hypothesis formulation. However, a critical challenge is hallucination, where LLMs generate factually incorrect or misleading information, compromising research integrity. To address this, we introduce HalluMatData, a benchmark dataset for evaluating hallucination detection methods, factual consistency, and response robustness in AI-generated materials science content. Alongside this, we propose HalluMatDetector, a multi-stage hallucination detection framework that integrates intrinsic verification, multi-source retrieval, contradiction graph analysis, and metric-based assessment to detect and mitigate LLM hallucinations. Our findings reveal that hallucination levels vary significantly across materials science subdomains, with high-entropy queries exhibiting greater factual inconsistencies. By utilizing HalluMatDetector verification pipeline, we reduce hallucination rates by 30% compared to standard LLM outputs. Furthermore, we introduce the Paraphrased Hallucination Consistency Score (PHCS) to quantify inconsistencies in LLM responses across semantically equivalent queries, offering deeper insights into model reliability.

TL;DR: GatedBias: A lightweight inference-time personalization framework that adapts frozen knowledge graph embeddings to individual user preferences using structure-gated adaptation with only ~300 parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models for knowledge graphs achieve strong cohort-level link prediction but fail to capture individual user preferences, creating a disconnect between general relational reasoning and personalized ranking.

Method: Introduces structure-gated adaptation: profile-specific features combine with graph-derived binary gates to produce interpretable, per-entity biases. Uses only ~300 trainable parameters and works at inference time without retraining or compromising global accuracy.

Result: Demonstrates statistically significant improvements in alignment metrics on Amazon-Book and Last-FM datasets while preserving cohort performance. Counterfactual experiments show 6-30× greater rank improvements for entities benefiting from specific preference signals.

Conclusion: Personalized adaptation of foundation models can be both parameter-efficient and causally verifiable, bridging general knowledge representations with individual user needs.

Abstract: Foundation models for knowledge graphs (KGs) achieve strong cohort-level performance in link prediction, yet fail to capture individual user preferences; a key disconnect between general relational reasoning and personalized ranking. We propose GatedBias, a lightweight inference-time personalization framework that adapts frozen KG embeddings to individual user contexts without retraining or compromising global accuracy. Our approach introduces structure-gated adaptation: profile-specific features combine with graph-derived binary gates to produce interpretable, per-entity biases, requiring only ${\sim}300$ trainable parameters. We evaluate GatedBias on two benchmark datasets (Amazon-Book and Last-FM), demonstrating statistically significant improvements in alignment metrics while preserving cohort performance. Counterfactual perturbation experiments validate causal responsiveness; entities benefiting from specific preference signals show 6--30$\times$ greater rank improvements when those signals are boosted. These results show that personalized adaptation of foundation models can be both parameter-efficient and causally verifiable, bridging general knowledge representations with individual user needs.

TL;DR: MCE introduces a formal monadic architecture for building robust AI agents using functional programming abstractions (Functors, Applicatives, Monads) to manage state, errors, and concurrency systematically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agent architectures are brittle and ad hoc, suffering from poor state management, error handling, and concurrency issues. There's a need for a formal, principled foundation for building resilient autonomous agents.

Method: Monadic Context Engineering (MCE) leverages functional programming abstractions: Monads for sequential composition, Applicatives for parallel execution, and Monad Transformers for composing capabilities. Treats agent workflows as computational contexts with intrinsic management of cross-cutting concerns.

Result: Enables construction of complex, resilient AI agents from simple, verifiable components. Extends to Meta-Agents for generative orchestration that dynamically create and manage sub-agent workflows through metaprogramming.

Conclusion: MCE provides a formal, algebraic foundation for AI agent design that addresses brittleness in current architectures through principled management of state, errors, and concurrency using functional programming patterns.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed a shift towards autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use. However, current agent architectures are frequently constructed using imperative, ad hoc patterns. This results in brittle systems plagued by difficulties in state management, error handling, and concurrency. This paper introduces Monadic Context Engineering (MCE), a novel architectural paradigm leveraging the algebraic structures of Functors, Applicative Functors, and Monads to provide a formal foundation for agent design. MCE treats agent workflows as computational contexts where cross-cutting concerns, such as state propagation, short-circuiting error handling, and asynchronous execution, are managed intrinsically by the algebraic properties of the abstraction. We demonstrate how Monads enable robust sequential composition, how Applicatives provide a principled structure for parallel execution, and crucially, how Monad Transformers allow for the systematic composition of these capabilities. This layered approach enables developers to construct complex, resilient, and efficient AI agents from simple, independently verifiable components. We further extend this framework to describe Meta-Agents, which leverage MCE for generative orchestration, dynamically creating and managing sub-agent workflows through metaprogramming.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has intensified concerns about manipulative or deceptive behaviors that can undermine user autonomy, trust, and well-being. Existing safety benchmarks predominantly rely on coarse binary labels and fail to capture the nuanced psychological and social mechanisms constituting manipulation. We introduce \textbf{DarkPatterns-LLM}, a comprehensive benchmark dataset and diagnostic framework for fine-grained assessment of manipulative content in LLM outputs across seven harm categories: Legal/Power, Psychological, Emotional, Physical, Autonomy, Economic, and Societal Harm. Our framework implements a four-layer analytical pipeline comprising Multi-Granular Detection (MGD), Multi-Scale Intent Analysis (MSIAN), Threat Harmonization Protocol (THP), and Deep Contextual Risk Alignment (DCRA). The dataset contains 401 meticulously curated examples with instruction-response pairs and expert annotations. Through evaluation of state-of-the-art models including GPT-4, Claude 3.5, and LLaMA-3-70B, we observe significant performance disparities (65.2\%--89.7\%) and consistent weaknesses in detecting autonomy-undermining patterns. DarkPatterns-LLM establishes the first standardized, multi-dimensional benchmark for manipulation detection in LLMs, offering actionable diagnostics toward more trustworthy AI systems.

*Yiming Lu,Tingyu Lu,Di Zhang,Lili Ye,Hao Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI-guided ML potential enables million-atom simulations revealing temperature-dependent dual-mode oxidation in aluminum nanoparticles, settling long-standing mass transfer controversy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the computational bottleneck in studying aluminum nanoparticle combustion - ab initio methods are too small/scale-limited while empirical potentials lack reactive fidelity, preventing understanding of atomic mechanisms in explosive transitions.

Method: Human-in-the-loop closed-loop framework with self-auditing AI Agents that validate machine learning potential evolution, enabling quantum accuracy with near-linear scalability to million-atom systems and nanosecond timescales.

Result: Revealed temperature-regulated dual-mode oxidation: moderate temperatures show oxide shell as "gatekeeper" with transient nanochannels ("breathing mode"), while above critical threshold shows "rupture mode" with catastrophic failure. Demonstrated aluminum cation outward diffusion dominates mass transfer (2-3 orders faster than oxygen), settling decades-old controversy.

Conclusion: Established unified atomic-scale framework for energetic nanomaterial design, enabling precision engineering of ignition sensitivity and energy release rates through intelligent computational design.

Abstract: Aluminum nanoparticles (ANPs) are among the most energy-dense solid fuels, yet the atomic mechanisms governing their transition from passivated particles to explosive reactants remain elusive. This stems from a fundamental computational bottleneck: ab initio methods offer quantum accuracy but are restricted to small spatiotemporal scales (< 500 atoms, picoseconds), while empirical force fields lack the reactive fidelity required for complex combustion environments. Herein, we bridge this gap by employing a "human-in-the-loop" closed-loop framework where self-auditing AI Agents validate the evolution of a machine learning potential (MLP). By acting as scientific sentinels that visualize hidden model artifacts for human decision-making, this collaborative cycle ensures quantum mechanical accuracy while exhibiting near-linear scalability to million-atom systems and accessing nanosecond timescales (energy RMSE: 1.2 meV/atom, force RMSE: 0.126 eV/Angstrom). Strikingly, our simulations reveal a temperature-regulated dual-mode oxidation mechanism: at moderate temperatures, the oxide shell acts as a dynamic "gatekeeper," regulating oxidation through a "breathing mode" of transient nanochannels; above a critical threshold, a "rupture mode" unleashes catastrophic shell failure and explosive combustion. Importantly, we resolve a decades-old controversy by demonstrating that aluminum cation outward diffusion, rather than oxygen transport, dominates mass transfer across all temperature regimes, with diffusion coefficients consistently exceeding those of oxygen by 2-3 orders of magnitude. These discoveries establish a unified atomic-scale framework for energetic nanomaterial design, enabling the precision engineering of ignition sensitivity and energy release rates through intelligent computational design.

*Rajesh P. N. Rao,Vishwas Sathish,Linxing Preston Jiang,Matthew Bryan,Prashant Rangarajan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Foundation models should integrate actions, hierarchical composition, and episodic memory to achieve safer, more interpretable, and human-like AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation models based on next-token prediction ignore three crucial components from neuroscience: action integration, hierarchical structure, and episodic memory, leading to hallucinations, lack of grounding, missing agency, safety threats, and energy inefficiency.

Method: Propose integrating actions at multiple abstraction scales with compositional generative architecture and episodic memory, drawing from neuroscience evidence, and comparing to current approaches like CoT and RAG.

Result: The paper presents a conceptual framework arguing that adding these brain-inspired components could address current AI deficiencies and improve safety, interpretability, and human-likeness.

Conclusion: Reviving the exchange between brain science and AI will help develop safe, interpretable human-centered AI by incorporating action integration, hierarchical composition, and episodic memory into foundation models.

Abstract: The phenomenal advances in large language models (LLMs) and other foundation models over the past few years have been based on optimizing large-scale transformer models on the surprisingly simple objective of minimizing next-token prediction loss, a form of predictive coding that is also the backbone of an increasingly popular model of brain function in neuroscience and cognitive science. However, current foundation models ignore three other important components of state-of-the-art predictive coding models: tight integration of actions with generative models, hierarchical compositional structure, and episodic memory. We propose that to achieve safe, interpretable, energy-efficient, and human-like AI, foundation models should integrate actions, at multiple scales of abstraction, with a compositional generative architecture and episodic memory. We present recent evidence from neuroscience and cognitive science on the importance of each of these components. We describe how the addition of these missing components to foundation models could help address some of their current deficiencies: hallucinations and superficial understanding of concepts due to lack of grounding, a missing sense of agency/responsibility due to lack of control, threats to safety and trustworthiness due to lack of interpretability, and energy inefficiency. We compare our proposal to current trends, such as adding chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to foundation models, and discuss new ways of augmenting these models with brain-inspired components. We conclude by arguing that a rekindling of the historically fruitful exchange of ideas between brain science and AI will help pave the way towards safe and interpretable human-centered AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic AI networking enables autonomous network management, but decentralized agents may have conflicting objectives. Need a framework to optimize performance while handling these conflicts efficiently.

Method: Proposes SANet architecture with semantic goal inference, model partition and sharing (MoPS) framework for large models, and two decentralized optimization algorithms for multi-agent multi-objective problems.

Result: Achieved 14.61% performance gains while requiring only 44.37% of FLOPs compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. Developed hardware prototype with theoretical bounds showing three-way tradeoff among optimization, generalization, and conflicting errors.

Conclusion: SANet effectively addresses conflicting objectives in AgentNet through semantic awareness and efficient model partitioning, demonstrating significant performance improvements with reduced computational overhead.

Abstract: Agentic AI networking (AgentNet) is a novel AI-native networking paradigm in which a large number of specialized AI agents collaborate to perform autonomous decision-making, dynamic environmental adaptation, and complex missions. It has the potential to facilitate real-time network management and optimization functions, including self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-adaptation across diverse and complex environments. This paper proposes SANet, a novel semantic-aware AgentNet architecture for wireless networks that can infer the semantic goal of the user and automatically assign agents associated with different layers of the network to fulfill the inferred goal. Motivated by the fact that AgentNet is a decentralized framework in which collaborating agents may generally have different and even conflicting objectives, we formulate the decentralized optimization of SANet as a multi-agent multi-objective problem, and focus on finding the Pareto-optimal solution for agents with distinct and potentially conflicting objectives. We propose three novel metrics for evaluating SANet. Furthermore, we develop a model partition and sharing (MoPS) framework in which large models, e.g., deep learning models, of different agents can be partitioned into shared and agent-specific parts that are jointly constructed and deployed according to agents' local computational resources. Two decentralized optimization algorithms are proposed. We derive theoretical bounds and prove that there exists a three-way tradeoff among optimization, generalization, and conflicting errors. We develop an open-source RAN and core network-based hardware prototype that implements agents to interact with three different layers of the network. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieved performance gains of up to 14.61% while requiring only 44.37% of FLOPs required by state-of-the-art algorithms.

TL;DR: M³ob: Multi-modal mobility prediction using LLM-enhanced spatial-temporal knowledge graphs to bridge semantic gaps between static images and dynamic mobility patterns for improved location recommendation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing human mobility prediction methods have limited generalization - unimodal approaches suffer from data sparsity and biases, while multi-modal methods struggle to capture mobility dynamics due to semantic gaps between static multi-modal representations and spatial-temporal dynamics.

Method: 1) Construct unified spatial-temporal relational graph (STRG) using LLM-enhanced spatial-temporal knowledge graph (STKG) to capture functional semantics and spatial-temporal knowledge. 2) Use gating mechanism to fuse spatial-temporal graph representations of different modalities. 3) Implement STKG-guided cross-modal alignment to inject spatial-temporal dynamic knowledge into static image modality.

Result: Extensive experiments on six public datasets show consistent improvements in normal scenarios and significant generalization ability in abnormal scenarios.

Conclusion: M³ob effectively leverages multi-modal spatial-temporal knowledge to characterize mobility dynamics, addressing limitations of existing methods and demonstrating strong performance and generalization for location recommendation tasks.

Abstract: The precise prediction of human mobility has produced significant socioeconomic impacts, such as location recommendations and evacuation suggestions. However, existing methods suffer from limited generalization capability: unimodal approaches are constrained by data sparsity and inherent biases, while multi-modal methods struggle to effectively capture mobility dynamics caused by the semantic gap between static multi-modal representation and spatial-temporal dynamics. Therefore, we leverage multi-modal spatial-temporal knowledge to characterize mobility dynamics for the location recommendation task, dubbed as \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{M}odal \textbf{Mob}ility (\textbf{M}$^3$\textbf{ob}). First, we construct a unified spatial-temporal relational graph (STRG) for multi-modal representation, by leveraging the functional semantics and spatial-temporal knowledge captured by the large language models (LLMs)-enhanced spatial-temporal knowledge graph (STKG). Second, we design a gating mechanism to fuse spatial-temporal graph representations of different modalities, and propose an STKG-guided cross-modal alignment to inject spatial-temporal dynamic knowledge into the static image modality. Extensive experiments on six public datasets show that our proposed method not only achieves consistent improvements in normal scenarios but also exhibits significant generalization ability in abnormal scenarios.

TL;DR: SimVC-CAS: A collective agent system that simulates VC decision-making as multi-agent interactions to predict startup success, improving accuracy by ~25% in AP@10.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Startup success prediction is critical but existing approaches overlook collective investor dynamics in real-world VC decisions, focusing instead on single decision-maker perspectives.

Method: Designs role-playing agents with unique traits/preferences and a GNN-based supervised interaction module to simulate VC decision-making as multi-agent interactions, capturing both enterprise fundamentals and investor network behavioral dynamics through graph-structured co-investment networks.

Result: Using PitchBook data with strict leakage controls, SimVC-CAS significantly improves predictive accuracy (~25% relative improvement in average precision@10) while providing interpretable, multi-perspective reasoning.

Conclusion: The approach successfully models real-world VC collective decision-making and can be extended to other complex group decision scenarios beyond startup financing prediction.

Abstract: Due to the high value and high failure rate of startups, predicting their success has become a critical challenge across interdisciplinary research. Existing approaches typically model success prediction from the perspective of a single decision-maker, overlooking the collective dynamics of investor groups that dominate real-world venture capital (VC) decisions. In this paper, we propose SimVC-CAS, a novel collective agent system that simulates VC decision-making as a multi-agent interaction process. By designing role-playing agents and a GNN-based supervised interaction module, we reformulate startup financing prediction as a group decision-making task, capturing both enterprise fundamentals and the behavioral dynamics of potential investor networks. Each agent embodies an investor with unique traits and preferences, enabling heterogeneous evaluation and realistic information exchange through a graph-structured co-investment network. Using real-world data from PitchBook and under strict data leakage controls, we show that SimVC-CAS significantly improves predictive accuracy while providing interpretable, multiperspective reasoning, for example, approximately 25% relative improvement with respect to average precision@10. SimVC-CAS also sheds light on other complex group decision scenarios.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM deliberation improves forecasting accuracy in diverse models with shared information, but not in homogeneous groups or with additional context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether structured deliberation (allowing LLMs to review each other's forecasts) can improve forecasting accuracy in large language models, similar to how it helps human forecasters.

Method: Tested GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Gemini Pro 2.5 on 202 resolved binary questions from Metaculus Q2 2025 AI Forecasting Tournament across four scenarios: diverse models with distributed/shared information and homogeneous models with distributed/shared information.

Result: Deliberation significantly improved accuracy only in scenario 2 (diverse models with shared information), reducing Log Loss by 0.020 (4% relative improvement, p=0.017). No benefit in homogeneous groups, and additional contextual information didn't improve accuracy.

Conclusion: Deliberation may be a viable strategy for improving LLM forecasting, but benefits depend on model diversity and information conditions.

Abstract: Structured deliberation has been found to improve the performance of human forecasters. This study investigates whether a similar intervention, i.e. allowing LLMs to review each other's forecasts before updating, can improve accuracy in large language models (GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini Pro 2.5). Using 202 resolved binary questions from the Metaculus Q2 2025 AI Forecasting Tournament, accuracy was assessed across four scenarios: (1) diverse models with distributed information, (2) diverse models with shared information, (3) homogeneous models with distributed information, and (4) homogeneous models with shared information. Results show that the intervention significantly improves accuracy in scenario (2), reducing Log Loss by 0.020 or about 4 percent in relative terms (p = 0.017). However, when homogeneous groups (three instances of the same model) engaged in the same process, no benefit was observed. Unexpectedly, providing LLMs with additional contextual information did not improve forecast accuracy, limiting our ability to study information pooling as a mechanism. Our findings suggest that deliberation may be a viable strategy for improving LLM forecasting.

*Shiyan Liu,Jian Ma,Rui Qu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DICE is a two-stage framework for explainable and robust evaluation of RAG systems, using probabilistic scoring and Swiss-system tournaments to improve interpretability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG evaluation metrics have limited interpretability, inadequate uncertainty quantification, and computational inefficiency in multi-system comparisons, hindering responsible deployment of RAG technologies.

Method: DICE combines deep analytical reasoning with probabilistic {A, B, Tie} scoring to produce transparent, confidence-aware judgments. It uses a Swiss-system tournament to reduce computational complexity from O(N²) to O(N log N).

Result: DICE achieves 85.7% agreement with human experts on a Chinese financial QA dataset, outperforming existing LLM-based metrics like RAGAS, and reduces computational requirements by 42.9% in eight-system evaluations.

Conclusion: DICE establishes a responsible, explainable, and efficient paradigm for trustworthy RAG system assessment, enabling systematic error diagnosis and actionable insights for system improvement.

Abstract: As Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems evolve toward more sophisticated architectures, ensuring their trustworthiness through explainable and robust evaluation becomes critical. Existing scalar metrics suffer from limited interpretability, inadequate uncertainty quantification, and computational inefficiency in multi-system comparisons, hindering responsible deployment of RAG technologies. We introduce DICE (Discrete Interpretable Comparative Evaluation), a two-stage, evidence-coupled framework that advances explainability and robustness in RAG evaluation. DICE combines deep analytical reasoning with probabilistic $\{A, B, Tie\}$ scoring to produce transparent, confidence-aware judgments that support accountable system improvement through interpretable reasoning traces, enabling systematic error diagnosis and actionable insights. To address efficiency challenges at scale, DICE employs a Swiss-system tournament that reduces computational complexity from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N \log N)$, achieving a 42.9% reduction in our eight-system evaluation while preserving ranking fidelity. Validation on a curated Chinese financial QA dataset demonstrates that DICE achieves 85.7% agreement with human experts, substantially outperforming existing LLM-based metrics such as RAGAS. Our results establish DICE as a responsible, explainable, and efficient paradigm for trustworthy RAG system assessment.

*Xiang Cheng,Yulan Hu,Xiangwen Zhang,Lu Xu,Zheng Pan,Xin Li,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TravelBench is a real-world travel planning benchmark with multi-turn interaction and tool use to comprehensively evaluate LLM agent capabilities in dynamic travel planning scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing travel planning benchmarks are limited in domain coverage and multi-turn interaction, failing to support dynamic user-agent interaction and comprehensive assessment of LLM agent capabilities in real-world travel planning scenarios.

Method: Created TravelBench with real-world user requests, three subsets (multi-turn, single-turn, unsolvable), and a controlled sandbox environment with 10 travel-domain tools providing deterministic outputs for reliable evaluation.

Result: Evaluated multiple LLMs on TravelBench and conducted analysis of their behaviors and performance, providing a practical benchmark for advancing LLM agents in travel planning.

Conclusion: TravelBench offers a practical and reproducible benchmark for advancing LLM agents in travel planning, addressing limitations of prior work through comprehensive multi-turn interaction and tool use evaluation.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated strong capabilities in planning and tool use. Travel planning provides a natural and high-impact testbed for these capabilities, as it requires multi-step reasoning, iterative preference elicitation through interaction, and calls to external tools under evolving constraints. Prior work has studied LLMs on travel-planning tasks, but existing settings are limited in domain coverage and multi-turn interaction. As a result, they cannot support dynamic user-agent interaction and therefore fail to comprehensively assess agent capabilities. In this paper, we introduce TravelBench, a real-world travel-planning benchmark featuring multi-turn interaction and tool use. We collect user requests from real-world scenarios and construct three subsets-multi-turn, single-turn, and unsolvable-to evaluate different aspects of agent performance. For stable and reproducible evaluation, we build a controlled sandbox environment with 10 travel-domain tools, providing deterministic tool outputs for reliable reasoning. We evaluate multiple LLMs on TravelBench and conduct an analysis of their behaviors and performance. TravelBench offers a practical and reproducible benchmark for advancing LLM agents in travel planning.

### [247] [Memento-II: Learning by Stateful Reflective Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22716)
*Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A theoretical framework for continual learning in LLM agents using episodic memory and reflection, enabling adaptation without backpropagation or fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable large language model agents to adapt continually through interaction without requiring backpropagation or model fine-tuning, bridging the gap between training and deployment phases.

Method: Introduces Stateful Reflective Decision Process: a two-stage read-write interaction with episodic memory where writing stores outcomes (policy evaluation) and reading retrieves past cases (policy improvement). Shows this induces an equivalent MDP over augmented state-memory representations.

Result: The framework is instantiated using entropy-regularized policy iteration with convergence guarantees. As episodic memory grows and covers the state space sufficiently, the resulting policy converges to optimal solution.

Conclusion: Provides a principled foundation for memory-augmented, retrieval-based LLM agents capable of continual adaptation without parameter updates, using reflection as the key mechanism for learning.

Abstract: We propose a theoretical framework for continual and experiential learning in large language model agents that integrates episodic memory with reinforcement learning. The framework identifies reflection as the key mechanism that enables agents to adapt through interaction without back propagation or model fine tuning, thereby relaxing the conventional separation between training and deployment.To formalise this process, we introduce the Stateful Reflective Decision Process, which models reflective learning as a two stage read write interaction with episodic memory. Writing stores interaction outcomes and corresponds to policy evaluation, while reading retrieves relevant past cases and corresponds to policy improvement. We show that this process induces an equivalent Markov decision process over augmented state memory representations, allowing the use of classical tools from dynamic programming and reinforcement learning. We further instantiate the framework using entropy regularised policy iteration and establish convergence guarantees. As episodic memory grows and achieves sufficient coverage of the state space, the resulting policy converges to the optimal solution. This work provides a principled foundation for memory augmented and retrieval based language model agents capable of continual adaptation without parameter updates.

*Xiaotian Ren,Nuerxiati Abudurexiti,Zhengyong Jiang,Angelos Stefanidis,Hongbin Liu,Jionglong Su*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAMP-HDRL is a hierarchical DRL framework for portfolio management that uses dynamic asset grouping, upper-lower agent coordination, and utility-based capital allocation to handle non-stationary markets, achieving superior performance with improved interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Portfolio optimization in non-stationary markets faces challenges from regime shifts, dynamic correlations, and limited interpretability of DRL policies, requiring a more structured and transparent approach.

Method: Hierarchical DRL framework with dynamic asset grouping (high-quality vs ordinary subsets), upper-level agent for global signals, lower-level agents for intra-group allocation with mask constraints, and utility-based capital allocation integrating risky and risk-free assets.

Result: Outperforms 9 traditional baselines and 9 DRL benchmarks across three market regimes (2019-2021), achieving at least 5% higher Return, Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, and 2% higher Omega ratio, with larger gains in turbulent markets.

Conclusion: SAMP-HDRL embeds structural market constraints into DRL pipeline, offering improved adaptability, robustness, and interpretability in complex financial environments through complementary "diversified + concentrated" mechanism across agents.

Abstract: Portfolio optimization in non-stationary markets is challenging due to regime shifts, dynamic correlations, and the limited interpretability of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) policies. We propose a Segmented Allocation with Momentum-Adjusted Utility for Multi-agent Portfolio Management via Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (SAMP-HDRL). The framework first applies dynamic asset grouping to partition the market into high-quality and ordinary subsets. An upper-level agent extracts global market signals, while lower-level agents perform intra-group allocation under mask constraints. A utility-based capital allocation mechanism integrates risky and risk-free assets, ensuring coherent coordination between global and local decisions. backtests across three market regimes (2019--2021) demonstrate that SAMP-HDRL consistently outperforms nine traditional baselines and nine DRL benchmarks under volatile and oscillating conditions. Compared with the strongest baseline, our method achieves at least 5\% higher Return, 5\% higher Sharpe ratio, 5\% higher Sortino ratio, and 2\% higher Omega ratio, with substantially larger gains observed in turbulent markets. Ablation studies confirm that upper--lower coordination, dynamic clustering, and capital allocation are indispensable to robustness. SHAP-based interpretability further reveals a complementary ``diversified + concentrated'' mechanism across agents, providing transparent insights into decision-making. Overall, SAMP-HDRL embeds structural market constraints directly into the DRL pipeline, offering improved adaptability, robustness, and interpretability in complex financial environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HiSciBench is a hierarchical benchmark evaluating foundation models across 5 levels of scientific workflow, spanning 6 disciplines with 8,735 multimodal instances, revealing significant performance gaps between basic literacy and discovery tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for evaluating scientific intelligence in foundation models are fragmented, focusing on narrow tasks rather than reflecting the hierarchical, multi-disciplinary nature of real scientific inquiry. There's a need for a comprehensive framework that mirrors the complete scientific workflow.

Method: Developed HiSciBench with 5 hierarchical levels: Scientific Literacy (L1), Literature Parsing (L2), Literature-based Question Answering (L3), Literature Review Generation (L4), and Scientific Discovery (L5). Contains 8,735 curated instances across 6 disciplines (math, physics, chemistry, biology, geography, astronomy) with multimodal inputs (text, equations, figures, tables) and cross-lingual evaluation.

Result: Evaluation of leading models (GPT-5, DeepSeek-R1, multimodal systems) shows substantial performance gaps: up to 69% accuracy on basic literacy tasks (L1), but performance declines sharply to 25% on discovery-level challenges (L5).

Conclusion: HiSciBench establishes a new standard for evaluating scientific intelligence, providing an integrated, dependency-aware framework for detailed diagnosis of model capabilities across different stages of scientific reasoning, offering actionable insights for developing more capable and reliable scientific AI models.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal foundation models has sparked growing interest in their potential for scientific research. However, scientific intelligence encompasses a broad spectrum of abilities ranging from understanding fundamental knowledge to conducting creative discovery, and existing benchmarks remain fragmented. Most focus on narrow tasks and fail to reflect the hierarchical and multi-disciplinary nature of real scientific inquiry. We introduce \textbf{HiSciBench}, a hierarchical benchmark designed to evaluate foundation models across five levels that mirror the complete scientific workflow: \textit{Scientific Literacy} (L1), \textit{Literature Parsing} (L2), \textit{Literature-based Question Answering} (L3), \textit{Literature Review Generation} (L4), and \textit{Scientific Discovery} (L5). HiSciBench contains 8,735 carefully curated instances spanning six major scientific disciplines, including mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, geography, and astronomy, and supports multimodal inputs including text, equations, figures, and tables, as well as cross-lingual evaluation. Unlike prior benchmarks that assess isolated abilities, HiSciBench provides an integrated, dependency-aware framework that enables detailed diagnosis of model capabilities across different stages of scientific reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations of leading models, including GPT-5, DeepSeek-R1, and several multimodal systems, reveal substantial performance gaps: while models achieve up to 69\% accuracy on basic literacy tasks, performance declines sharply to 25\% on discovery-level challenges. HiSciBench establishes a new standard for evaluating scientific Intelligence and offers actionable insights for developing models that are not only more capable but also more reliable. The benchmark will be publicly released to facilitate future research.

### [250] [Geometric Structural Knowledge Graph Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22931)
*Ling Xin,Mojtaba Nayyeri,Zahra Makki Nayeri,Steffen Staab*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Gamma introduces multi-head geometric attention with diverse algebraic transformations for knowledge graph reasoning, outperforming Ultra by 5.5% in zero-shot inductive link prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing structural knowledge graph foundation models like Ultra rely on single relational transformations in message passing, which limits expressiveness and fails to capture diverse relational and structural patterns across different graphs.

Method: Gamma replaces single relational transformation with multiple parallel ones (real, complex, split-complex, and dual number based transformations) and uses relational conditioned attention fusion with lightweight gating and entropy regularization to adaptively combine them at link level.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on 56 diverse knowledge graphs show Gamma consistently outperforms Ultra, achieving 5.5% improvement in mean reciprocal rank on inductive benchmarks and 4.4% improvement across all benchmarks.

Conclusion: Gamma's multi-head geometric attention with complementary algebraic representations enhances expressiveness and robustness in knowledge graph reasoning, demonstrating the value of diverse geometric transformations for capturing varied relational structures.

Abstract: Structural knowledge graph foundation models aim to generalize reasoning to completely new graphs with unseen entities and relations. A key limitation of existing approaches like Ultra is their reliance on a single relational transformation (e.g., element-wise multiplication) in message passing, which can constrain expressiveness and fail to capture diverse relational and structural patterns exhibited on diverse graphs. In this paper, we propose Gamma, a novel foundation model that introduces multi-head geometric attention to knowledge graph reasoning. Gamma replaces the single relational transformation with multiple parallel ones, including real, complex, split-complex, and dual number based transformations, each designed to model different relational structures. A relational conditioned attention fusion mechanism then adaptively fuses them at link level via a lightweight gating with entropy regularization, allowing the model to robustly emphasize the most appropriate relational bias for each triple pattern. We present a full formalization of these algebraic message functions and discuss how their combination increases expressiveness beyond any single space. Comprehensive experiments on 56 diverse knowledge graphs demonstrate that Gamma consistently outperforms Ultra in zero-shot inductive link prediction, with a 5.5% improvement in mean reciprocal rank on the inductive benchmarks and a 4.4% improvement across all benchmarks, highlighting benefits from complementary geometric representations.

*Danni Xu,Shaojing Fan,Xuanang Cheng,Mohan Kankanhalli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RW-Post dataset provides real-world multimodal misinformation with annotated reasoning and evidence, while AgentFact framework uses specialized agents to emulate human verification workflow for improved fact-checking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal fact-checking systems have limitations in reasoning and evidence utilization, lacking dedicated datasets with complete real-world misinformation instances, annotated reasoning processes, and verifiable evidence.

Method: 1) Created RW-Post dataset by aligning real-world multimodal claims with original social media posts and extracting reasoning/evidence from human fact-checking articles using LLM-assisted pipeline. 2) Developed AgentFact framework with five specialized agents for strategy planning, evidence retrieval, visual analysis, reasoning, and explanation generation, using iterative workflow alternating between evidence searching and task-aware filtering.

Result: The combination of RW-Post dataset and AgentFact framework substantially improves both accuracy and interpretability of multimodal fact-checking compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: RW-Post addresses the dataset bottleneck for multimodal misinformation verification, and AgentFact's agent-based approach effectively emulates human verification workflow, leading to more accurate and explainable fact-checking systems.

Abstract: The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation poses a growing challenge for automated fact-checking systems. Existing approaches, including large vision language models (LVLMs) and deep multimodal fusion methods, often fall short due to limited reasoning and shallow evidence utilization. A key bottleneck is the lack of dedicated datasets that provide complete real-world multimodal misinformation instances accompanied by annotated reasoning processes and verifiable evidence. To address this limitation, we introduce RW-Post, a high-quality and explainable dataset for real-world multimodal fact-checking. RW-Post aligns real-world multimodal claims with their original social media posts, preserving the rich contextual information in which the claims are made. In addition, the dataset includes detailed reasoning and explicitly linked evidence, which are derived from human written fact-checking articles via a large language model assisted extraction pipeline, enabling comprehensive verification and explanation. Building upon RW-Post, we propose AgentFact, an agent-based multimodal fact-checking framework designed to emulate the human verification workflow. AgentFact consists of five specialized agents that collaboratively handle key fact-checking subtasks, including strategy planning, high-quality evidence retrieval, visual analysis, reasoning, and explanation generation. These agents are orchestrated through an iterative workflow that alternates between evidence searching and task-aware evidence filtering and reasoning, facilitating strategic decision-making and systematic evidence analysis. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the synergy between RW-Post and AgentFact substantially improves both the accuracy and interpretability of multimodal fact-checking.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-based tutors underperform traditional knowledge tracing models in assessing student learning over time, showing reliability and temporal coherence issues despite fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about replacing traditional learner modeling with LLM-based tutors in high-risk K-12 education, especially regarding accurate assessment of evolving student knowledge over time.

Method: Compared deep knowledge tracing (DKT) model with widely used LLM (zero-shot and fine-tuned) using large open-access dataset, analyzing accuracy, reliability, temporal coherence, and computational demands.

Result: DKT outperformed LLM variants in discrimination performance (AUC = 0.83 vs LLM's lower scores), showed better temporal coherence, and required far less computational resources despite LLM fine-tuning improvements.

Conclusion: LLMs alone cannot match established intelligent tutoring systems; responsible K-12 tutoring requires hybrid frameworks incorporating learner modeling rather than relying solely on generative models.

Abstract: The rapid rise of large language model (LLM)-based tutors in K--12 education has fostered a misconception that generative models can replace traditional learner modelling for adaptive instruction. This is especially problematic in K--12 settings, which the EU AI Act classifies as high-risk domain requiring responsible design. Motivated by these concerns, this study synthesises evidence on limitations of LLM-based tutors and empirically investigates one critical issue: the accuracy, reliability, and temporal coherence of assessing learners' evolving knowledge over time. We compare a deep knowledge tracing (DKT) model with a widely used LLM, evaluated zero-shot and fine-tuned, using a large open-access dataset. Results show that DKT achieves the highest discrimination performance (AUC = 0.83) on next-step correctness prediction and consistently outperforms the LLM across settings. Although fine-tuning improves the LLM's AUC by approximately 8\% over the zero-shot baseline, it remains 6\% below DKT and produces higher early-sequence errors, where incorrect predictions are most harmful for adaptive support. Temporal analyses further reveal that DKT maintains stable, directionally correct mastery updates, whereas LLM variants exhibit substantial temporal weaknesses, including inconsistent and wrong-direction updates. These limitations persist despite the fine-tuned LLM requiring nearly 198 hours of high-compute training, far exceeding the computational demands of DKT. Our qualitative analysis of multi-skill mastery estimation further shows that, even after fine-tuning, the LLM produced inconsistent mastery trajectories, while DKT maintained smooth and coherent updates. Overall, the findings suggest that LLMs alone are unlikely to match the effectiveness of established intelligent tutoring systems, and that responsible tutoring requires hybrid frameworks that incorporate learner modelling.

*Fady Rezk,Yuangang Pan,Chuan-Sheng Foo,Xun Xu,Nancy Chen,Henry Gouk,Timothy Hospedales*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Standard reward model accuracy fails to predict deployment performance for personalized alignment; policy accuracy and behavioral benchmarks reveal critical gaps between preference ranking and actual generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current personalized alignment research focuses on improving reward model accuracy, assuming better preference ranking leads to better personalized behavior. However, deployment constraints require inference-time adaptation via reward-guided decoding, creating a need for reward models that effectively guide token-level generation decisions, not just rank preferences accurately.

Method: Systematic evaluation across three datasets introduces policy accuracy metric to quantify whether reward-guided decoding scoring functions correctly discriminate between preferred and dispreferred responses. Also introduces Pref-LaMP benchmark with ground-truth user completions for direct behavioral evaluation without circular reward-based metrics.

Result: RM accuracy correlates only weakly with policy-level discrimination ability (Kendall's tau = 0.08-0.31). On Pref-LaMP, methods with 20-point RM accuracy differences produce almost identical output quality, and even high-discrimination methods fail to generate behaviorally aligned responses. Simple in-context learning dominates all reward-guided methods for models >3B parameters.

Conclusion: The field optimizes proxy metrics that fail to predict deployment performance and do not translate preferences into real behavioral adaptation under deployment constraints. Reward model accuracy is insufficient for deployment-ready personalized alignment.

Abstract: Personalized alignment from preference data has focused primarily on improving reward model (RM) accuracy, with the implicit assumption that better preference ranking translates to better personalized behavior. However, in deployment, computational constraints necessitate inference-time adaptation via reward-guided decoding (RGD) rather than per-user policy fine-tuning. This creates a critical but overlooked requirement: reward models must not only rank preferences accurately but also effectively guide token-level generation decisions. We demonstrate that standard RM accuracy fails catastrophically as a selection criterion for deployment-ready personalized alignment. Through systematic evaluation across three datasets, we introduce policy accuracy, a metric quantifying whether RGD scoring functions correctly discriminate between preferred and dispreferred responses. We show that RM accuracy correlates only weakly with this policy-level discrimination ability (Kendall's tau = 0.08--0.31). More critically, we introduce Pref-LaMP, the first personalized alignment benchmark with ground-truth user completions, enabling direct behavioral evaluation without circular reward-based metrics. On Pref-LaMP, we expose a complete decoupling between discrimination and generation: methods with 20-point RM accuracy differences produce almost identical output quality, and even methods achieving high discrimination fail to generate behaviorally aligned responses. Finally, simple in-context learning (ICL) dominates all reward-guided methods for models > 3B parameters, achieving 3-5 point ROUGE-1 gains over the best reward method at 7B scale. These findings show that the field optimizes proxy metrics that fail to predict deployment performance and do not translate preferences into real behavioral adaptation under deployment constraints.

TL;DR: ChexReason is a resource-efficient vision-language model for medical imaging that shows RL improves in-distribution performance but harms cross-dataset generalization, suggesting supervised fine-tuning may be better for clinical robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore resource-constrained RL applications for LLMs in medical imaging, where current approaches are underexplored despite RL advances in reasoning tasks.

Method: ChexReason model trained via R1-style methodology (SFT followed by GRPO) using only 2,000 SFT samples, 1,000 RL samples, and a single A100 GPU.

Result: GRPO improves in-distribution performance (23% improvement on CheXpert, macro-F1 = 0.346) but degrades cross-dataset transferability (19% drop on NIH). SFT checkpoint uniquely improves on NIH before optimization, and structured reasoning scaffolds benefit general-purpose VLMs but not medically pre-trained models.

Conclusion: Curated supervised fine-tuning may outperform aggressive RL for clinical deployment requiring robustness across diverse populations, as RL causes generalization paradox despite scale.

Abstract: Recent Reinforcement Learning (RL) advances for Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved reasoning tasks, yet their resource-constrained application to medical imaging remains underexplored. We introduce ChexReason, a vision-language model trained via R1-style methodology (SFT followed by GRPO) using only 2,000 SFT samples, 1,000 RL samples, and a single A100 GPU. Evaluations on CheXpert and NIH benchmarks reveal a fundamental tension: GRPO recovers in-distribution performance (23% improvement on CheXpert, macro-F1 = 0.346) but degrades cross-dataset transferability (19% drop on NIH). This mirrors high-resource models like NV-Reason-CXR-3B, suggesting the issue stems from the RL paradigm rather than scale. We identify a generalization paradox where the SFT checkpoint uniquely improves on NIH before optimization, indicating teacher-guided reasoning captures more institution-agnostic features. Furthermore, cross-model comparisons show structured reasoning scaffolds benefit general-purpose VLMs but offer minimal gain for medically pre-trained models. Consequently, curated supervised fine-tuning may outperform aggressive RL for clinical deployment requiring robustness across diverse populations.

*Yu Li,Tian Lan,Zhengling Qi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ISPO is a new preference optimization method that addresses DPO's limitations by enabling LLMs to condition on alternative responses during training, leading to more robust alignment without inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO has limitations: optimal policy depends on arbitrary modeling choices (scalarization function, reference policy), and treating responses in isolation fails to leverage comparative information in pairwise data, leaving self-reflection capacity untapped.

Method: Proposes Intrinsic Self-reflective Preference Optimization (ISPO), deriving a globally optimal policy that conditions on both context and alternative responses, ensuring invariance to scalarization and reference choices.

Result: Experiments show consistent improvements in win rates and length-controlled metrics, validating that unlocking self-reflection yields more robust, human-aligned LLMs.

Conclusion: ISPO serves as a plug-and-play enhancement without architectural changes or inference overhead, proving superior to DPO/RLHF while guaranteeing invariance to modeling choices.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants have become standard for aligning Large Language Models due to their simplicity and offline stability. However, we identify two fundamental limitations. First, the optimal policy depends on arbitrary modeling choices (scalarization function, reference policy), yielding behavior reflecting parameterization artifacts rather than true preferences. Second, treating response generation in isolation fails to leverage comparative information in pairwise data, leaving the model's capacity for intrinsic self-reflection untapped. To address it, we propose Intrinsic Self-reflective Preference Optimization (\q), deriving a globally optimal policy conditioning on both context and alternative responses. We prove this formulation superior to DPO/RLHF while guaranteeing invariance to scalarization and reference choices. \q~serves as a plug-and-play enhancement without architectural changes or inference overhead. Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in win rates and length-controlled metrics, validating that unlocking self-reflection yields more robust, human-aligned LLMs.

TL;DR: Current EI evaluation frameworks for AI need refinement as they don't adequately measure relevant EI aspects for AI systems, while including irrelevant human-specific components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks for evaluating emotional intelligence in AI systems are inadequate because they don't properly distinguish between human-specific EI components (like phenomenological understanding) and the EI capabilities that AI systems can actually demonstrate, leading to incomplete or misdirected evaluations.

Method: 1) Review different theories of emotion and general EI to determine applicability to artificial systems; 2) Critically evaluate available benchmark frameworks against the developed account of EI; 3) Outline options for improving evaluation strategies to address identified shortcomings.

Result: The paper identifies that current EI evaluation frameworks for AI lack solid foundation in emotion theory, fail to distinguish between human-specific and AI-relevant EI components, and need refinement to properly assess AI's capabilities in sensing emotional states, explaining them, responding appropriately, and adapting to new contexts.

Conclusion: EI evaluation frameworks for AI need to be redesigned to focus on measurable EI components relevant to artificial systems, excluding human-specific phenomenological aspects, and should be grounded in proper emotion theory to create more accurate and comprehensive assessment tools.

Abstract: In this paper, we develop the position that current frameworks for evaluating emotional intelligence (EI) in artificial intelligence (AI) systems need refinement because they do not adequately or comprehensively measure the various aspects of EI relevant in AI. Human EI often involves a phenomenological component and a sense of understanding that artificially intelligent systems lack; therefore, some aspects of EI are irrelevant in evaluating AI systems. However, EI also includes an ability to sense an emotional state, explain it, respond appropriately, and adapt to new contexts (e.g., multicultural), and artificially intelligent systems can do such things to greater or lesser degrees. Several benchmark frameworks specialize in evaluating the capacity of different AI models to perform some tasks related to EI, but these often lack a solid foundation regarding the nature of emotion and what it is to be emotionally intelligent. In this project, we begin by reviewing different theories about emotion and general EI, evaluating the extent to which each is applicable to artificial systems. We then critically evaluate the available benchmark frameworks, identifying where each falls short in light of the account of EI developed in the first section. Lastly, we outline some options for improving evaluation strategies to avoid these shortcomings in EI evaluation in AI systems.

TL;DR: SPIRAL embeds three specialized LLM agents into MCTS for better planning: Planner proposes steps, Simulator grounds outcomes, Critic provides dense rewards, outperforming CoT and other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with complex planning requiring exploration and self-correction due to linear reasoning; MCTS with sparse rewards fails to leverage LLMs' semantic capabilities.

Method: SPIRAL framework with three LLM agents in MCTS loop: Planner (creative next steps), Simulator (realistic outcomes), Critic (dense rewards via reflection).

Result: Outperforms Chain-of-Thought and state-of-the-art agents; achieves 83.6% accuracy on DailyLifeAPIs (16+ point improvement), with superior token efficiency.

Conclusion: Structuring LLM reasoning as guided, reflective, grounded search yields more robust and efficient autonomous planners.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often falter at complex planning tasks that require exploration and self-correction, as their linear reasoning process struggles to recover from early mistakes. While search algorithms like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) can explore alternatives, they are often ineffective when guided by sparse rewards and fail to leverage the rich semantic capabilities of LLMs. We introduce SPIRAL (Symbolic LLM Planning via Grounded and Reflective Search), a novel framework that embeds a cognitive architecture of three specialized LLM agents into an MCTS loop. SPIRAL's key contribution is its integrated planning pipeline where a Planner proposes creative next steps, a Simulator grounds the search by predicting realistic outcomes, and a Critic provides dense reward signals through reflection. This synergy transforms MCTS from a brute-force search into a guided, self-correcting reasoning process. On the DailyLifeAPIs and HuggingFace datasets, SPIRAL consistently outperforms the default Chain-of-Thought planning method and other state-of-the-art agents. More importantly, it substantially surpasses other state-of-the-art agents; for example, SPIRAL achieves 83.6% overall accuracy on DailyLifeAPIs, an improvement of over 16 percentage points against the next-best search framework, while also demonstrating superior token efficiency. Our work demonstrates that structuring LLM reasoning as a guided, reflective, and grounded search process yields more robust and efficient autonomous planners.

### [258] [From Model Choice to Model Belief: Establishing a New Measure for LLM-Based Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23184)
*Hongshen Sun,Juanjuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Using LLM token probabilities (model belief) instead of just output choices provides more statistically efficient estimates, reducing computation needs by ~20x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current practices using LLM outputs as single data points underutilize the probabilistic information inherent in LLMs, leading to inefficient data usage.

Method: Introduces "model belief" derived from LLM's token-level probabilities, capturing belief distribution over alternatives in a single generation run.

Result: Model belief is asymptotically equivalent to mean model choices but has lower variance, faster convergence, and reduces computation needs by factor of 20 in demand estimation.

Conclusion: Model belief should be the default measure for extracting more information from LLM-generated data due to superior statistical efficiency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate human behavior, but common practices to use LLM-generated data are inefficient. Treating an LLM's output ("model choice") as a single data point underutilizes the information inherent to the probabilistic nature of LLMs. This paper introduces and formalizes "model belief," a measure derived from an LLM's token-level probabilities that captures the model's belief distribution over choice alternatives in a single generation run. The authors prove that model belief is asymptotically equivalent to the mean of model choices (a non-trivial property) but forms a more statistically efficient estimator, with lower variance and a faster convergence rate. Analogous properties are shown to hold for smooth functions of model belief and model choice often used in downstream applications. The authors demonstrate the performance of model belief through a demand estimation study, where an LLM simulates consumer responses to different prices. In practical settings with limited numbers of runs, model belief explains and predicts ground-truth model choice better than model choice itself, and reduces the computation needed to reach sufficiently accurate estimates by roughly a factor of 20. The findings support using model belief as the default measure to extract more information from LLM-generated data.

### [259] [TCEval: Using Thermal Comfort to Assess Cognitive and Perceptual Abilities of AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23217)
*Jingming Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TCEval is the first evaluation framework using thermal comfort scenarios to assess AI's cross-modal reasoning, causal association, and adaptive decision-making capabilities, revealing current LLMs have foundational cross-modal reasoning but lack precise causal understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a critical gap in LLM task-specific benchmarks. Thermal comfort, with its complex interplay of environmental factors and personal perceptions involving sensory integration and adaptive decision-making, serves as an ideal paradigm for evaluating real-world cognitive capabilities of AI systems.

Method: Initialize LLM agents with virtual personality attributes, guide them to generate clothing insulation selections and thermal comfort feedback, and validate outputs against the ASHRAE Global Database and Chinese Thermal Comfort Database.

Result: Experiments on four LLMs show agent feedback has limited exact alignment with humans, but directional consistency improves significantly with 1 PMV tolerance. LLM-generated PMV distributions diverge markedly from human data, and agents perform near-randomly in discrete thermal comfort classification.

Conclusion: TCEval is feasible as an ecologically valid Cognitive Turing Test for AI, demonstrating current LLMs possess foundational cross-modal reasoning ability but lack precise causal understanding of nonlinear relationships in thermal comfort. It shifts AI evaluation focus from abstract task proficiency to embodied, context-aware perception and decision-making.

Abstract: A critical gap exists in LLM task-specific benchmarks. Thermal comfort, a sophisticated interplay of environmental factors and personal perceptions involving sensory integration and adaptive decision-making, serves as an ideal paradigm for evaluating real-world cognitive capabilities of AI systems. To address this, we propose TCEval, the first evaluation framework that assesses three core cognitive capacities of AI, cross-modal reasoning, causal association, and adaptive decision-making, by leveraging thermal comfort scenarios and large language model (LLM) agents. The methodology involves initializing LLM agents with virtual personality attributes, guiding them to generate clothing insulation selections and thermal comfort feedback, and validating outputs against the ASHRAE Global Database and Chinese Thermal Comfort Database. Experiments on four LLMs show that while agent feedback has limited exact alignment with humans, directional consistency improves significantly with a 1 PMV tolerance. Statistical tests reveal that LLM-generated PMV distributions diverge markedly from human data, and agents perform near-randomly in discrete thermal comfort classification. These results confirm the feasibility of TCEval as an ecologically valid Cognitive Turing Test for AI, demonstrating that current LLMs possess foundational cross-modal reasoning ability but lack precise causal understanding of the nonlinear relationships between variables in thermal comfort. TCEval complements traditional benchmarks, shifting AI evaluation focus from abstract task proficiency to embodied, context-aware perception and decision-making, offering valuable insights for advancing AI in human-centric applications like smart buildings.

*Yoonpyo Lee,Kazuma Kobayashi,Sai Puppala,Sajedul Talukder,Seid Koric,Souvik Chakraborty,Syed Bahauddin Alam*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Compact language models trained as Agentic Physical AI achieve stable control through physics-based validation, showing sharp phase transitions with scale and autonomous strategy selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI foundation models for physical systems fail at control interfaces due to perception-centric architectures that optimize for imitation rather than outcome guarantees, achieving only 50-53% accuracy on basic physics tasks.

Method: Train compact 360M-parameter language models as Agentic Physical AI using physics-based validation on synthetic reactor control scenarios, scaling datasets from 10^3 to 10^5 examples.

Result: Models show sharp phase transition: small-scale systems have high-variance imitation with catastrophic risk, while large-scale models achieve 500x variance reduction and stabilize execution. Despite exposure to multiple strategies, models autonomously reject 70% of training distribution and concentrate 95% execution on single-bank strategy.

Conclusion: Physics-driven validation enables compact domain-specific foundation models that overcome structural limitations of perception-centric AI, achieving stable control with autonomous strategy selection and transferable representations across physics domains.

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm in AI for physical systems, scaling general-purpose foundation models toward universal multimodal reasoning, confronts a fundamental barrier at the control interface. Recent benchmarks show that even frontier vision-language models achieve only 50-53% accuracy on basic quantitative physics tasks, behaving as approximate guessers that preserve semantic plausibility while violating physical constraints. This input unfaithfulness is not a scaling deficiency but a structural limitation. Perception-centric architectures optimize parameter-space imitation, whereas safety-critical control demands outcome-space guarantees over executed actions. Here, we present a fundamentally different pathway toward domain-specific foundation models by introducing compact language models operating as Agentic Physical AI, in which policy optimization is driven by physics-based validation rather than perceptual inference. We train a 360-million-parameter model on synthetic reactor control scenarios, scaling the dataset from 10^3 to 10^5 examples. This induces a sharp phase transition absent in general-purpose models. Small-scale systems exhibit high-variance imitation with catastrophic tail risk, while large-scale models undergo variance collapse exceeding 500x reduction, stabilizing execution-level behavior. Despite balanced exposure to four actuation families, the model autonomously rejects approximately 70% of the training distribution and concentrates 95% of runtime execution on a single-bank strategy. Learned representations transfer across distinct physics and continuous input modalities without architectural modification.

### [261] [On Conformant Planning and Model-Checking of $\exists^*\forall^*$ Hyperproperties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23324)
*Raven Beutner,Bernd Finkbeiner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper establishes a formal connection between conformant planning and hyperproperty model-checking, showing they are essentially equivalent problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge two seemingly distinct problems in planning and verification communities - conformant planning (finding plans robust to non-deterministic effects) and hyperproperty model-checking (verifying properties relating multiple execution traces).

Method: Two-way reduction: (1) Efficiently reduce hyperproperty model-checking instances to conformant planning instances with soundness/completeness proofs, and (2) Show that every conformant planning problem is itself a hyperproperty model-checking task.

Result: Established that model-checking of ∃*∀* hyperproperties and conformant planning are closely related problems, with formal reductions in both directions demonstrating their equivalence.

Conclusion: Conformant planning and hyperproperty model-checking are fundamentally connected problems, enabling cross-fertilization of techniques and insights between planning and verification communities.

Abstract: We study the connection of two problems within the planning and verification community: Conformant planning and model-checking of hyperproperties. Conformant planning is the task of finding a sequential plan that achieves a given objective independent of non-deterministic action effects during the plan's execution. Hyperproperties are system properties that relate multiple execution traces of a system and, e.g., capture information-flow and fairness policies. In this paper, we show that model-checking of $\exists^*\forall^*$ hyperproperties is closely related to the problem of computing a conformant plan. Firstly, we show that we can efficiently reduce a hyperproperty model-checking instance to a conformant planning instance, and prove that our encoding is sound and complete. Secondly, we establish the converse direction: Every conformant planning problem is, itself, a hyperproperty model-checking task.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM agents struggle with physical-world deployment due to spatial reasoning challenges. CubeBench uses Rubik's Cube tasks to diagnose three cognitive bottlenecks: spatial reasoning, long-horizon state tracking, and active exploration under partial observation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents excel in digital domains but fail in physical-world deployment because they lack robust spatial mental models. The paper aims to identify and address three core cognitive challenges preventing this transition.

Method: Introduces CubeBench, a generative benchmark using Rubik's Cube with three-tiered diagnostic framework: 1) foundational state tracking with full symbolic information, 2) intermediate tasks, 3) active exploration with partial visual data. Also proposes diagnostic framework with external solver tools.

Result: Leading LLMs show critical limitations, achieving 0.00% pass rate on all long-horizon tasks, revealing fundamental failure in long-term planning. The diagnostic framework successfully isolates cognitive bottlenecks.

Conclusion: CubeBench exposes fundamental gaps in LLM spatial cognition and long-horizon reasoning. The analysis provides key insights to guide development of more physically-grounded intelligent agents by addressing identified cognitive bottlenecks.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, while proficient in the digital realm, face a significant gap in physical-world deployment due to the challenge of forming and maintaining a robust spatial mental model. We identify three core cognitive challenges hindering this transition: spatial reasoning, long-horizon state tracking via mental simulation, and active exploration under partial observation. To isolate and evaluate these faculties, we introduce CubeBench, a novel generative benchmark centered on the Rubik's Cube. CubeBench uses a three-tiered diagnostic framework that progressively assesses agent capabilities, from foundational state tracking with full symbolic information to active exploration with only partial visual data. Our experiments on leading LLMs reveal critical limitations, including a uniform 0.00% pass rate on all long-horizon tasks, exposing a fundamental failure in long-term planning. We also propose a diagnostic framework to isolate these cognitive bottlenecks by providing external solver tools. By analyzing the failure modes, we provide key insights to guide the development of more physically-grounded intelligent agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MindWatcher is a tool-integrated reasoning agent that combines interleaved thinking with multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning to autonomously decide when and how to invoke diverse tools for complex decision-making tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional workflow-based agents have limited intelligence for real-world problems requiring tool invocation, creating a need for more autonomous agents capable of reasoning and coordinating multiple tools without human prompts.

Method: MindWatcher integrates interleaved thinking (switching between thinking and tool calling) with multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning (manipulating images during reasoning). It uses automated data auditing pipelines, high-quality training datasets, auxiliary reasoning tools, and a large-scale local image retrieval database covering eight categories.

Result: MindWatcher matches or exceeds the performance of larger or more recent models through superior tool invocation. The research also uncovered critical insights like the genetic inheritance phenomenon in agentic reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: MindWatcher demonstrates that tool-integrated reasoning agents with interleaved thinking and multimodal CoT capabilities can effectively address broad-domain multimodal problems, with the added benefit of more efficient training infrastructure.

Abstract: Traditional workflow-based agents exhibit limited intelligence when addressing real-world problems requiring tool invocation. Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) agents capable of autonomous reasoning and tool invocation are rapidly emerging as a powerful approach for complex decision-making tasks involving multi-step interactions with external environments. In this work, we introduce MindWatcher, a TIR agent integrating interleaved thinking and multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. MindWatcher can autonomously decide whether and how to invoke diverse tools and coordinate their use, without relying on human prompts or workflows. The interleaved thinking paradigm enables the model to switch between thinking and tool calling at any intermediate stage, while its multimodal CoT capability allows manipulation of images during reasoning to yield more precise search results. We implement automated data auditing and evaluation pipelines, complemented by manually curated high-quality datasets for training, and we construct a benchmark, called MindWatcher-Evaluate Bench (MWE-Bench), to evaluate its performance. MindWatcher is equipped with a comprehensive suite of auxiliary reasoning tools, enabling it to address broad-domain multimodal problems. A large-scale, high-quality local image retrieval database, covering eight categories including cars, animals, and plants, endows model with robust object recognition despite its small size. Finally, we design a more efficient training infrastructure for MindWatcher, enhancing training speed and hardware utilization. Experiments not only demonstrate that MindWatcher matches or exceeds the performance of larger or more recent models through superior tool invocation, but also uncover critical insights for agent training, such as the genetic inheritance phenomenon in agentic RL.

*Alex Lewandowski,Adtiya A. Ramesh,Edan Meyer,Dale Schuurmans,Marlos C. Machado*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a computationally-embedded perspective for continual learning where agents are constrained by being simulated within a universal computer, introduces an "interactivity" objective to measure continual adaptation, and shows deep linear networks sustain interactivity better than nonlinear ones as capacity increases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing continual learning formulations use explicit constraints that can be ad hoc and limit scalability. The paper aims to characterize a setting where agents are inherently constrained by being embedded in the environment, motivated by the "big world hypothesis" that the world is bigger than the agent.

Method: Introduces a computationally-embedded perspective representing agents as automata simulated within a universal computer, proves equivalence to POMDPs over infinite state-spaces, proposes "interactivity" objective for continual adaptation, and develops model-based RL algorithm for interactivity-seeking with evaluation on synthetic problems.

Result: Deep nonlinear networks struggle to sustain interactivity, while deep linear networks sustain higher interactivity as capacity increases, suggesting linear architectures may be better suited for continual learning in embedded settings.

Conclusion: The computationally-embedded perspective provides a principled foundation for continual learning where agents are inherently constrained, and interactivity serves as a useful objective for evaluating continual adaptation capabilities, with linear networks showing promise for scalable continual learning.

Abstract: Continual learning is often motivated by the idea, known as the big world hypothesis, that "the world is bigger" than the agent. Recent problem formulations capture this idea by explicitly constraining an agent relative to the environment. These constraints lead to solutions in which the agent continually adapts to best use its limited capacity, rather than converging to a fixed solution. However, explicit constraints can be ad hoc, difficult to incorporate, and may limit the effectiveness of scaling up the agent's capacity. In this paper, we characterize a problem setting in which an agent, regardless of its capacity, is constrained by being embedded in the environment. In particular, we introduce a computationally-embedded perspective that represents an embedded agent as an automaton simulated within a universal (formal) computer. Such an automaton is always constrained; we prove that it is equivalent to an agent that interacts with a partially observable Markov decision process over a countably infinite state-space. We propose an objective for this setting, which we call interactivity, that measures an agent's ability to continually adapt its behaviour by learning new predictions. We then develop a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm for interactivity-seeking, and use it to construct a synthetic problem to evaluate continual learning capability. Our results show that deep nonlinear networks struggle to sustain interactivity, whereas deep linear networks sustain higher interactivity as capacity increases.

Conclusion: AKG kernel agent demonstrates effectiveness in accelerating kernel development for modern AI workloads by automating kernel generation, migration, and performance tuning across multiple hardware platforms and DSLs, addressing the critical bottleneck in AI system development.

Abstract: Modern AI models demand high-performance computation kernels. The growing complexity of LLMs, multimodal architectures, and recommendation systems, combined with techniques like sparsity and quantization, creates significant computational challenges. Moreover, frequent hardware updates and diverse chip architectures further complicate this landscape, requiring tailored kernel implementations for each platform. However, manual optimization cannot keep pace with these demands, creating a critical bottleneck in AI system development.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HiR is a sample-efficient RL framework for aligning LLMs that replays failed attempts as successes based on satisfied constraints, enabling efficient learning with sparse rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL for aligning LLMs struggles with sparse rewards because initial models often fail to generate responses satisfying all constraints, making successful samples rare and learning difficult.

Method: HiR uses a select-then-rewrite strategy to replay failed attempts as successes based on constraints satisfied in hindsight, performing RL on both original and replayed samples with dual-preference learning at instruction- and response-level.

Result: Extensive experiments show HiR yields promising results across different instruction following tasks while requiring less computational budget compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: HiR provides an effective sample-efficient RL framework for complex instruction following by leveraging hindsight replay to overcome sparse reward challenges in LLM alignment.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow instructions with various constraints. Despite the encouraging results, RL improvement inevitably relies on sampling successful, high-quality responses; however, the initial model often struggles to generate responses that satisfy all constraints due to its limited capabilities, yielding sparse or indistinguishable rewards that impede learning. In this work, we propose Hindsight instruction Replay (HiR), a novel sample-efficient RL framework for complex instruction following tasks, which employs a select-then-rewrite strategy to replay failed attempts as successes based on the constraints that have been satisfied in hindsight. We perform RL on these replayed samples as well as the original ones, theoretically framing the objective as dual-preference learning at both the instruction- and response-level to enable efficient optimization using only a binary reward signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed HiR yields promising results across different instruction following tasks, while requiring less computational budget.

TL;DR: MIRAGE-VC is a multi-perspective retrieval-augmented generation framework that uses information-gain-driven path retrieval and multi-agent reasoning to predict venture capital investment success from heterogeneous graph data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VC investments have high failure rates with few outsized successes. Traditional ML and GNNs lack reasoning capabilities, while LLMs struggle with graph modality. Existing graph-LLM methods focus on in-graph tasks, but VC prediction is an off-graph problem where the target exists outside the network.

Method: Uses information-gain-driven path retriever to iteratively select high-value neighbors, distilling investment networks into compact chains. Employs multi-agent architecture with three evidence streams and learnable gating mechanism based on company attributes to handle heterogeneous evidence fusion.

Result: Achieves +5.0% F1 and +16.6% PrecisionAt5 improvements under strict anti-leakage controls. Demonstrates applicability to other off-graph prediction tasks like recommendation and risk assessment.

Conclusion: MIRAGE-VC effectively addresses path explosion and heterogeneous evidence fusion challenges in off-graph prediction tasks, enabling explicit reasoning over complex relational evidence for VC investment success prediction.

Abstract: Most venture capital (VC) investments fail, while a few deliver outsized returns. Accurately predicting startup success requires synthesizing complex relational evidence, including company disclosures, investor track records, and investment network structures, through explicit reasoning to form coherent, interpretable investment theses. Traditional machine learning and graph neural networks both lack this reasoning capability. Large language models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning but face a modality mismatch with graphs. Recent graph-LLM methods target in-graph tasks where answers lie within the graph, whereas VC prediction is off-graph: the target exists outside the network. The core challenge is selecting graph paths that maximize predictor performance on an external objective while enabling step-by-step reasoning. We present MIRAGE-VC, a multi-perspective retrieval-augmented generation framework that addresses two obstacles: path explosion (thousands of candidate paths overwhelm LLM context) and heterogeneous evidence fusion (different startups need different analytical emphasis). Our information-gain-driven path retriever iteratively selects high-value neighbors, distilling investment networks into compact chains for explicit reasoning. A multi-agent architecture integrates three evidence streams via a learnable gating mechanism based on company attributes. Under strict anti-leakage controls, MIRAGE-VC achieves +5.0% F1 and +16.6% PrecisionAt5, and sheds light on other off-graph prediction tasks such as recommendation and risk assessment.

TL;DR: AI alignment requires agents that can reason under uncertainty and handle incomplete/non-Archimedean preferences in assistance and shutdown scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure AI systems are aligned with human values and remain safe, we need to address fundamental challenges in AI assistance (learning human utility functions) and shutdown problems (ensuring safe deactivation).

Method: Analyze the AI assistance problem (where AI must learn unknown human utility functions) and the AI shutdown problem (where AI must respond appropriately to shutdown signals) through game-theoretic frameworks.

Result: The analysis reveals that solving these alignment challenges requires AI agents capable of reasoning under uncertainty and handling both incomplete and non-Archimedean preferences.

Conclusion: AI safety and alignment fundamentally depend on developing agents with sophisticated reasoning capabilities that can navigate uncertainty and complex preference structures in assistance and shutdown scenarios.

Abstract: How can we ensure that AI systems are aligned with human values and remain safe? We can study this problem through the frameworks of the AI assistance and the AI shutdown games. The AI assistance problem concerns designing an AI agent that helps a human to maximise their utility function(s). However, only the human knows these function(s); the AI assistant must learn them. The shutdown problem instead concerns designing AI agents that: shut down when a shutdown button is pressed; neither try to prevent nor cause the pressing of the shutdown button; and otherwise accomplish their task competently. In this paper, we show that addressing these challenges requires AI agents that can reason under uncertainty and handle both incomplete and non-Archimedean preferences.

TL;DR: CreativeDC is a two-phase prompting method that decouples creative exploration from constraint satisfaction to help LLMs generate more diverse educational problems, overcoming the "Artificial Hivemind" effect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have potential for educational question generation but suffer from the "Artificial Hivemind" effect, producing overly similar and repetitive problems that harm diversity of thought for students.

Method: CreativeDC uses a two-phase prompting method inspired by Wallas's creativity theory and Guilford's divergent-convergent thinking framework. It explicitly scaffolds LLM reasoning into distinct phases: creative exploration (divergent thinking) followed by constraint satisfaction (convergent thinking).

Result: CreativeDC achieves significantly higher diversity and novelty compared to baselines while maintaining high utility. Scaling analysis shows it generates a larger effective number of distinct problems as more are sampled, increasing at a faster rate than baseline methods.

Conclusion: By decoupling creative exploration from constraint satisfaction, CreativeDC enables LLMs to explore a broader space of ideas before committing to final problems, effectively addressing the homogeneity issue in LLM-generated educational content.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significant potential for generating educational questions and problems, enabling educators to create large-scale learning materials. However, LLMs are fundamentally limited by the ``Artificial Hivemind'' effect, where they generate similar responses within the same model and produce homogeneous outputs across different models. As a consequence, students may be exposed to overly similar and repetitive LLM-generated problems, which harms diversity of thought. Drawing inspiration from Wallas's theory of creativity and Guilford's framework of divergent-convergent thinking, we propose CreativeDC, a two-phase prompting method that explicitly scaffolds the LLM's reasoning into distinct phases. By decoupling creative exploration from constraint satisfaction, our method enables LLMs to explore a broader space of ideas before committing to a final problem. We evaluate CreativeDC for creative problem generation using a comprehensive set of metrics that capture diversity, novelty, and utility. The results show that CreativeDC achieves significantly higher diversity and novelty compared to baselines while maintaining high utility. Moreover, scaling analysis shows that CreativeDC generates a larger effective number of distinct problems as more are sampled, increasing at a faster rate than baseline methods.

Conclusion: NeuroSPICE provides a flexible PINN-based alternative to conventional SPICE that enables new capabilities for circuit simulation, particularly for design optimization and emerging device technologies.

Abstract: We present NeuroSPICE, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework for device and circuit simulation. Unlike conventional SPICE, which relies on time-discretized numerical solvers, NeuroSPICE leverages PINNs to solve circuit differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) by minimizing the residual of the equations through backpropagation. It models device and circuit waveforms using analytical equations in time domain with exact temporal derivatives.

*Federico Baldo,Charles K. Assaad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: I-PERI is a federated causal discovery algorithm that handles unknown client-level interventions by recovering a union CPDAG and exploiting structural differences across clients to get a tighter equivalence class called Φ-CPDAG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated causal discovery methods assume all clients share the same causal model, which is unrealistic in practice where client-specific policies or protocols (e.g., across hospitals) induce heterogeneous and unknown interventions.

Method: I-PERI first recovers the CPDAG of the union of client graphs, then orients additional edges by exploiting structural differences induced by interventions across clients, yielding a tighter equivalence class called Φ-Markov Equivalence Class represented by Φ-CPDAG.

Result: Theoretical guarantees on convergence and privacy-preserving properties are provided, with empirical evaluations on synthetic data demonstrating the algorithm's effectiveness.

Conclusion: I-PERI addresses the practical challenge of federated causal discovery under unknown client-level interventions, providing a theoretically sound and empirically effective solution that moves beyond unrealistic homogeneity assumptions.

Abstract: Most causal discovery methods recover a completed partially directed acyclic graph representing a Markov equivalence class from observational data. Recent work has extended these methods to federated settings to address data decentralization and privacy constraints, but often under idealized assumptions that all clients share the same causal model. Such assumptions are unrealistic in practice, as client-specific policies or protocols, for example, across hospitals, naturally induce heterogeneous and unknown interventions. In this work, we address federated causal discovery under unknown client-level interventions. We propose I-PERI, a novel federated algorithm that first recovers the CPDAG of the union of client graphs and then orients additional edges by exploiting structural differences induced by interventions across clients. This yields a tighter equivalence class, which we call the $\mathbfΦ$-Markov Equivalence Class, represented by the $\mathbfΦ$-CPDAG. We provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence of I-PERI, as well as on its privacy-preserving properties, and present empirical evaluations on synthetic data demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

TL;DR: Web World Model (WWM) bridges web frameworks and generative world models by using web code for structured world state/mechanics while LLMs handle narrative/context generation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language agents need persistent worlds for action, memory, and learning. Current approaches are either too rigid (web frameworks with fixed contexts) or too uncontrolled (fully generative world models lacking controllability).

Method: WWM implements world state and "physics" in ordinary web code for logical consistency, while LLMs generate context, narratives, and high-level decisions on top of this structured latent state. Built on realistic web stacks with various applications including travel atlas, galaxy explorers, encyclopedic worlds, and game environments.

Result: Developed practical design principles: separating code-defined rules from model-driven imagination, representing latent state as typed web interfaces, and using deterministic generation for unlimited but structured exploration. Shows web stacks can serve as scalable substrate for world models.

Conclusion: Web World Model provides a middle ground between rigid web frameworks and uncontrolled generative models, enabling controllable yet open-ended environments for language agents through structured web code combined with LLM imagination.

Abstract: Language agents increasingly require persistent worlds in which they can act, remember, and learn. Existing approaches sit at two extremes: conventional web frameworks provide reliable but fixed contexts backed by databases, while fully generative world models aim for unlimited environments at the expense of controllability and practical engineering. In this work, we introduce the Web World Model (WWM), a middle ground where world state and ``physics'' are implemented in ordinary web code to ensure logical consistency, while large language models generate context, narratives, and high-level decisions on top of this structured latent state. We build a suite of WWMs on a realistic web stack, including an infinite travel atlas grounded in real geography, fictional galaxy explorers, web-scale encyclopedic and narrative worlds, and simulation- and game-like environments. Across these systems, we identify practical design principles for WWMs: separating code-defined rules from model-driven imagination, representing latent state as typed web interfaces, and utilizing deterministic generation to achieve unlimited but structured exploration. Our results suggest that web stacks themselves can serve as a scalable substrate for world models, enabling controllable yet open-ended environments.
