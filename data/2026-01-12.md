### [1] [Bi-Orthogonal Factor Decomposition for Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05328)
*Fenil R. Doshi,Thomas Fel,Talia Konkle,George Alvarez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BFD framework decomposes attention into position/content factors, revealing vision transformers primarily use content interactions, with specialized heads and DINOv2 showing enhanced holistic shape processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of principled understanding of what information attention mechanisms exchange between tokens in Vision Transformers - attention maps show where weight concentrates but not whether queries/keys trade position, content, or both.

Method: Bi-orthogonal Factor Decomposition (BFD): two-stage analytical framework: 1) ANOVA-based decomposition disentangles token activations into orthogonal positional and content factors; 2) SVD of query-key interaction matrix QK^T exposes bi-orthogonal modes revealing how factors mediate communication.

Result: Three key findings: 1) Attention operates primarily through content (content-content interactions dominate, followed by content-position coupling); 2) Attention mechanisms exhibit specialization (heads differentiate into content-content, content-position, position-position operators); 3) DINOv2's superior holistic shape processing emerges from intermediate layers preserving positional structure while enriching semantic content.

Conclusion: BFD exposes how tokens interact through attention and which informational factors (positional or semantic) mediate their communication, providing practical insights into vision transformer mechanisms and revealing DINOv2's enhanced capabilities.

Abstract: Self-attention is the central computational primitive of Vision Transformers, yet we lack a principled understanding of what information attention mechanisms exchange between tokens. Attention maps describe where weight mass concentrates; they do not reveal whether queries and keys trade position, content, or both. We introduce Bi-orthogonal Factor Decomposition (BFD), a two-stage analytical framework: first, an ANOVA-based decomposition statistically disentangles token activations into orthogonal positional and content factors; second, SVD of the query-key interaction matrix QK^T exposes bi-orthogonal modes that reveal how these factors mediate communication. After validating proper isolation of position and content, we apply BFD to state-of-the-art vision models and uncover three phenomena.(i) Attention operates primarily through content. Content-content interactions dominate attention energy, followed by content-position coupling. DINOv2 allocates more energy to content-position than supervised models and distributes computation across a richer mode spectrum. (ii) Attention mechanisms exhibit specialization: heads differentiate into content-content, content-position, and position-position operators, while singular modes within heads show analogous specialization. (iii) DINOv2's superior holistic shape processing emerges from intermediate layers that simultaneously preserve positional structure while contextually enriching semantic content.
  Overall, BFD exposes how tokens interact through attention and which informational factors - positional or semantic - mediate their communication, yielding practical insights into vision transformer mechanisms.

### [2] [Coding the Visual World: From Image to Simulation Using Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05344)
*Sagi Eppel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs can generate code to simulate complex systems from images but struggle with fine details, showing high-level understanding with limited low-level perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether Vision Language Models can understand and simulate the systems depicted in images by generating executable code that recreates them, testing their capacity for constructing mental models of visual systems.

Method: Im2Sim methodology: VLMs analyze natural images of real-world systems, describe the system, write generative code to simulate it, execute the code to produce synthetic images, and compare against originals across various domains (physical systems, vegetation, cities, materials, geology).

Result: Leading VLMs (GPT, Gemini) demonstrate capacity to understand and model complex, multi-component systems across multiple abstraction layers and diverse domains, but exhibit limited ability to replicate fine details and low-level pattern arrangements.

Conclusion: VLMs show an interesting asymmetry: they combine high-level, deep visual understanding of images with limited perception of fine details, revealing both strengths and limitations in their ability to construct mental models of visual systems.

Abstract: The ability to construct mental models of the world is a central aspect of understanding. Similarly, visual understanding can be viewed as the ability to construct a representative model of the system depicted in an image. This work explores the capacity of Vision Language Models (VLMs) to recognize and simulate the systems and mechanisms depicted in images using the Im2Sim methodology. The VLM is given a natural image of a real-world system (e.g., cities, clouds, vegetation) and is tasked with describing the system and writing code that simulates and generates it. This generative code is then executed to produce a synthetic image, which is compared against the original. This approach is tested on various complex emergent systems, ranging from physical systems (waves, lights, clouds) to vegetation, cities, materials, and geological formations. Through analysis of the models and images generated by the VLMs, we examine their understanding of the systems in images. The results show that leading VLMs (GPT, Gemini) demonstrate the capacity to understand and model complex, multi-component systems across multiple layers of abstraction and a wide range of domains. At the same time, the VLMs exhibit limited ability to replicate fine details and low-level arrangements of patterns in the image. These findings reveal an interesting asymmetry: VLMs combine high-level, deep visual understanding of images with limited perception of fine details.

### [4] [MOSAIC-GS: Monocular Scene Reconstruction via Advanced Initialization for Complex Dynamic Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05368)
*Svitlana Morkva,Maximum Wilder-Smith,Michael Oechsle,Alessio Tonioni,Marco Hutter,Vaishakh Patil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOSAIC-GS is an efficient explicit method for reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular videos using Gaussian Splatting, leveraging multiple geometric cues and separating static/dynamic components for fast training and real-time rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular dynamic scene reconstruction is ill-posed due to lack of multiview constraints, making accurate geometry recovery and temporal coherence challenging. Existing methods struggle with motion inference from visual appearance alone in monocular settings.

Method: Uses multiple geometric cues (depth, optical flow, dynamic object segmentation, point tracking) with rigidity-based motion constraints to estimate preliminary 3D dynamics. Decomposes scene into static/dynamic components, with dynamic Gaussians using time-dependent Poly-Fourier curves for efficient motion encoding.

Result: Achieves substantially faster optimization and rendering compared to existing methods while maintaining reconstruction quality on par with state-of-the-art approaches across standard monocular dynamic scene benchmarks.

Conclusion: MOSAIC-GS provides a computationally efficient, explicit approach for high-fidelity dynamic scene reconstruction from monocular videos by leveraging geometric cues and efficient motion representation, enabling fast training and real-time rendering.

Abstract: We present MOSAIC-GS, a novel, fully explicit, and computationally efficient approach for high-fidelity dynamic scene reconstruction from monocular videos using Gaussian Splatting. Monocular reconstruction is inherently ill-posed due to the lack of sufficient multiview constraints, making accurate recovery of object geometry and temporal coherence particularly challenging. To address this, we leverage multiple geometric cues, such as depth, optical flow, dynamic object segmentation, and point tracking. Combined with rigidity-based motion constraints, these cues allow us to estimate preliminary 3D scene dynamics during an initialization stage. Recovering scene dynamics prior to the photometric optimization reduces reliance on motion inference from visual appearance alone, which is often ambiguous in monocular settings. To enable compact representations, fast training, and real-time rendering while supporting non-rigid deformations, the scene is decomposed into static and dynamic components. Each Gaussian in the dynamic part of the scene is assigned a trajectory represented as time-dependent Poly-Fourier curve for parameter-efficient motion encoding. We demonstrate that MOSAIC-GS achieves substantially faster optimization and rendering compared to existing methods, while maintaining reconstruction quality on par with state-of-the-art approaches across standard monocular dynamic scene benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ensemble methods combining deep learning and radiomics outperform individual approaches for breast cancer detection in mammograms, achieving AUC of 0.87.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early breast cancer diagnosis is critical for survival improvement, and while radiomics and deep learning show promise, there's a need to assess their combined potential for enhanced detection accuracy.

Method: Used two independent datasets (RSNA 2023 with 11,913 patients and Mexican TecSalud with 19,400 patients). Trained ConvNeXtV1-small DL model on RSNA and validated on TecSalud, developed radiomics models on TecSalud with leave-one-year-out validation, and created ensemble methods by consistently combining and calibrating predictions.

Result: Ensemble approach achieved highest AUC of 0.87, outperforming ConvNeXtV1-small (0.83) and radiomics alone (0.80), demonstrating superior diagnostic performance.

Conclusion: Ensemble methods that combine deep learning and radiomics predictions significantly enhance breast cancer diagnosis from mammograms, providing improved detection accuracy over individual approaches.

Abstract: Early diagnosis of breast cancer is crucial for improving survival rates. Radiomics and deep learning (DL) have shown significant potential in assisting radiologists with early cancer detection. This paper aims to critically assess the performance of radiomics, DL, and ensemble techniques in detecting cancer from screening mammograms. Two independent datasets were used: the RSNA 2023 Breast Cancer Detection Challenge (11,913 patients) and a Mexican cohort from the TecSalud dataset (19,400 patients). The ConvNeXtV1-small DL model was trained on the RSNA dataset and validated on the TecSalud dataset, while radiomics models were developed using the TecSalud dataset and validated with a leave-one-year-out approach. The ensemble method consistently combined and calibrated predictions using the same methodology. Results showed that the ensemble approach achieved the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.87, compared to 0.83 for ConvNeXtV1-small and 0.80 for radiomics. In conclusion, ensemble methods combining DL and radiomics predictions significantly enhance breast cancer diagnosis from mammograms.

### [6] [EdgeLDR: Quaternion Low-Displacement Rank Neural Networks for Edge-Efficient Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05379)
*Vladimir Frants,Sos Agaian,Karen Panetta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EdgeLDR combines quaternion neural networks with block-circulant structure for efficient edge deployment, using FFT-based computation to achieve significant compression with competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying deep neural networks on edge devices is limited by memory traffic and compute cost. Quaternion networks improve parameter efficiency but retain dense weights, while structured matrices enable fast computation but are usually applied in real domain only.

Method: Introduces EdgeLDR framework for quaternion block-circulant linear and convolutional layers that combines quaternion channel mixing with block-circulant parameter structure, enabling FFT-based evaluation through complex adjoint representation.

Result: FFT evaluation yields large empirical speedups over naive implementation, keeps latency stable as block size increases, and enables larger compression factors. EdgeLDR layers integrated into CNN/Transformer backbones show significant compression with competitive accuracy on RGB and hyperspectral image classification tasks.

Conclusion: EdgeLDR provides a practical framework for efficient edge deployment by combining quaternion channel mixing with block-circulant structure, achieving significant compression while maintaining competitive accuracy through FFT-based computation.

Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks on edge devices is often limited by the memory traffic and compute cost of dense linear operators. While quaternion neural networks improve parameter efficiency by coupling multiple channels through Hamilton products, they typically retain unstructured dense weights; conversely, structured matrices enable fast computation but are usually applied in the real domain. This paper introduces EdgeLDR, a practical framework for quaternion block-circulant linear and convolutional layers that combines quaternion channel mixing with block-circulant parameter structure and enables FFT-based evaluation through the complex adjoint representation. We present reference implementations of EdgeLDR layers and compare FFT-based computation against a naive spatial-domain realization of quaternion circulant products. FFT evaluation yields large empirical speedups over the naive implementation and keeps latency stable as block size increases, making larger compression factors computationally viable. We further integrate EdgeLDR layers into compact CNN and Transformer backbones and evaluate accuracy-compression trade-offs on 32x32 RGB classification (CIFAR-10/100, SVHN) and hyperspectral image classification (Houston 2013, Pavia University), reporting parameter counts and CPU/GPU latency. The results show that EdgeLDR layers provide significant compression with competitive accuracy.

### [7] [Sketch&Patch++: Efficient Structure-Aware 3D Gaussian Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05394)
*Yuang Shi,Simone Gasparini,Géraldine Morin,Wei Tsang Ooi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes hybrid Gaussian representation with Sketch (high-frequency) and Patch (low-frequency) Gaussians for progressive 3D scene streaming, achieving significant quality improvements at reduced model sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations lack semantic structure for efficient streaming, while artists use layered techniques (sketch then fill). Need structure-aware representation for bandwidth-constrained networks and resource-limited devices.

Method: Hierarchical adaptive categorization framework using multi-criteria density-based clustering and adaptive quality-driven refinement on 3DGS representation, separating Gaussians into Sketch (edges/contours) and Patch (smooth regions) categories.

Result: Achieves up to 1.74 dB PSNR improvement, 6.7% SSIM gain, and 41.4% LPIPS improvement at equivalent model sizes vs uniform pruning. Maintains visual quality with only 0.5% of original model size for indoor scenes.

Conclusion: Structure-aware hybrid Gaussian representation enables efficient storage, adaptive streaming, and high-fidelity rendering across bandwidth-constrained networks and resource-limited devices without external 3D line primitives.

Abstract: We observe that Gaussians exhibit distinct roles and characteristics analogous to traditional artistic techniques -- like how artists first sketch outlines before filling in broader areas with color, some Gaussians capture high-frequency features such as edges and contours, while others represent broader, smoother regions analogous to brush strokes that add volume and depth. Based on this observation, we propose a hybrid representation that categorizes Gaussians into (i) Sketch Gaussians, which represent high-frequency, boundary-defining features, and (ii) Patch Gaussians, which cover low-frequency, smooth regions. This semantic separation naturally enables layered progressive streaming, where the compact Sketch Gaussians establish the structural skeleton before Patch Gaussians incrementally refine volumetric detail.
  In this work, we extend our previous method to arbitrary 3D scenes by proposing a novel hierarchical adaptive categorization framework that operates directly on the 3DGS representation. Our approach employs multi-criteria density-based clustering, combined with adaptive quality-driven refinement. This method eliminates dependency on external 3D line primitives while ensuring optimal parametric encoding effectiveness. Our comprehensive evaluation across diverse scenes, including both man-made and natural environments, demonstrates that our method achieves up to 1.74 dB improvement in PSNR, 6.7% in SSIM, and 41.4% in LPIPS at equivalent model sizes compared to uniform pruning baselines. For indoor scenes, our method can maintain visual quality with only 0.5\% of the original model size. This structure-aware representation enables efficient storage, adaptive streaming, and rendering of high-fidelity 3D content across bandwidth-constrained networks and resource-limited devices.

*Zhaohui Liang,Sivaramakrishnan Rajaraman,Niccolo Marini,Zhiyun Xue,Sameer Antani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fine-tuning BiomedCLIP with multi-task learning improves chest X-ray image-text retrieval performance by incorporating clinical abnormality detection and contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP and BiomedCLIP provide strong cross-modal embeddings but are not optimized for fine-grained medical retrieval tasks like retrieving clinically relevant radiology reports using chest X-ray image queries.

Method: Multi-task learning framework fine-tuning BiomedCLIP with lightweight MLP projector head trained with composite loss: binary cross-entropy for normal/abnormal classification, supervised contrastive loss for intra-class consistency, and CLIP loss for cross-modal alignment.

Result: Fine-tuned model achieves more balanced and clinically meaningful performance across both image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval tasks compared to pretrained BiomedCLIP and general-purpose CLIP. t-SNE visualizations show clearer semantic clustering of normal/abnormal cases.

Conclusion: Domain-adaptive, multi-task learning is valuable for advancing cross-modal retrieval in biomedical applications, enhancing diagnostic sensitivity through improved semantic clustering.

Abstract: CLIP and BiomedCLIP are examples of vision-language foundation models and offer strong cross-modal embeddings; however, they are not optimized for fine-grained medical retrieval tasks, such as retrieving clinically relevant radiology reports using chest X-ray (CXR) image queries. To address this shortcoming, we propose a multi-task learning framework to fine-tune BiomedCLIP and evaluate improvements to CXR image-text retrieval. Using BiomedCLIP as the backbone, we incorporate a lightweight MLP projector head trained with a multi-task composite loss function that includes: (1) a binary cross-entropy loss to distinguish normal from abnormal CXR studies, (2) a supervised contrastive loss to reinforce intra-class consistency, and (3) a CLIP loss to maintain cross-modal alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that the fine-tuned model achieves more balanced and clinically meaningful performance across both image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval tasks compared to the pretrained BiomedCLIP and general-purpose CLIP models. Furthermore, t-SNE visualizations reveal clearer semantic clustering of normal and abnormal cases, demonstrating the model's enhanced diagnostic sensitivity. These findings highlight the value of domain-adaptive, multi-task learning for advancing cross-modal retrieval in biomedical applications.

*Hassaan Farooq,Marvin Brenner,Peter St\ütz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlyPose: lightweight top-down human pose estimation pipeline for aerial UAV imagery that improves detection and pose estimation accuracy while running in real-time (~20ms) on embedded hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAVs operating near humans need accurate perception of human poses from aerial viewpoints, which is challenging due to low resolution, steep angles, occlusion, and real-time requirements.

Method: Multi-dataset training of lightweight top-down human pose estimation pipeline specifically designed for aerial imagery, deployed on Jetson Orin AGX for onboard UAV processing.

Result: Achieved 6.8 mAP improvement in person detection across multiple datasets and 16.3 mAP improvement in 2D pose estimation on UAV-Human dataset, with ~20ms inference latency on embedded hardware.

Conclusion: FlyPose enables real-time, accurate human pose estimation from aerial perspectives, addressing key challenges in UAV applications, with the release of FlyPose-104 dataset for further research.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in close proximity to humans for applications such as parcel delivery, traffic monitoring, disaster response and infrastructure inspections. Ensuring safe and reliable operation in these human-populated environments demands accurate perception of human poses and actions from an aerial viewpoint. This perspective challenges existing methods with low resolution, steep viewing angles and (self-)occlusion, especially if the application demands realtime feasibile models. We train and deploy FlyPose, a lightweight top-down human pose estimation pipeline for aerial imagery. Through multi-dataset training, we achieve an average improvement of 6.8 mAP in person detection across the test-sets of Manipal-UAV, VisDrone, HIT-UAV as well as our custom dataset. For 2D human pose estimation we report an improvement of 16.3 mAP on the challenging UAV-Human dataset. FlyPose runs with an inference latency of ~20 milliseconds including preprocessing on a Jetson Orin AGX Developer Kit and is deployed onboard a quadrotor UAV during flight experiments. We also publish FlyPose-104, a small but challenging aerial human pose estimation dataset, that includes manual annotations from difficult aerial perspectives: https://github.com/farooqhassaan/FlyPose.

### [10] [Thinking with Map: Reinforced Parallel Map-Augmented Agent for Geolocalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05432)
*Yuxiang Ji,Yong Wang,Ziyu Ma,Yiming Hu,Hailang Huang,Xuecai Hu,Guanhua Chen,Liaoni Wu,Xiangxiang Chu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new image geolocalization method that equips models with "Thinking with Map" ability using agent-in-the-map loop, with two-stage optimization (agentic RL + parallel test-time scaling), achieving significant improvements over existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLM approaches for image geolocalization overlook a key human strategy - using maps. While current methods leverage world knowledge and reasoning, they miss the crucial map-based reasoning humans naturally employ for location identification.

Method: Proposes "Thinking with Map" ability formulated as agent-in-the-map loop. Uses two-stage optimization: 1) Agentic reinforcement learning to improve sampling efficiency, and 2) Parallel test-time scaling that explores multiple candidate paths before final prediction. Also introduces MAPBench benchmark with real-world images.

Result: Outperforms existing open- and closed-source models on most metrics. Specifically improves Acc@500m from 8.0% to 22.1% compared to Gemini-3-Pro with Google Search/Map grounded mode, showing substantial performance gains.

Conclusion: The "Thinking with Map" approach with agent-in-the-map loop and two-stage optimization significantly advances image geolocalization by incorporating map-based reasoning, demonstrating the importance of mimicking human map-using strategies for this task.

Abstract: The image geolocalization task aims to predict the location where an image was taken anywhere on Earth using visual clues. Existing large vision-language model (LVLM) approaches leverage world knowledge, chain-of-thought reasoning, and agentic capabilities, but overlook a common strategy used by humans -- using maps. In this work, we first equip the model \textit{Thinking with Map} ability and formulate it as an agent-in-the-map loop. We develop a two-stage optimization scheme for it, including agentic reinforcement learning (RL) followed by parallel test-time scaling (TTS). The RL strengthens the agentic capability of model to improve sampling efficiency, and the parallel TTS enables the model to explore multiple candidate paths before making the final prediction, which is crucial for geolocalization. To evaluate our method on up-to-date and in-the-wild images, we further present MAPBench, a comprehensive geolocalization training and evaluation benchmark composed entirely of real-world images. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing open- and closed-source models on most metrics, specifically improving Acc@500m from 8.0\% to 22.1\% compared to \textit{Gemini-3-Pro} with Google Search/Map grounded mode.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative approaches fail to capture functional complexity of real-world interiors, particularly articulated objects with movable parts essential for robotic manipulation and navigation. There's a need for automatically generating large-scale, interactive, and physically realistic 3D environments for advancing robotic learning and embodied intelligence.

Method: Uses language-guided diffusion framework with LLM module for floor layout generation from natural language prompts, diffusion-based posterior sampling to populate scenes with articulated assets from 3D repositories, and differentiable guidance functions to regulate object quantity, prevent articulation collisions, and maintain walkable space for robotic navigation.

Conclusion: SceneFoundry presents an effective framework for generating apartment-scale 3D worlds with articulated furniture for robotic training, addressing the limitations of existing approaches and enabling scalable embodied AI research through physically usable, interactive environments.

Abstract: The ability to automatically generate large-scale, interactive, and physically realistic 3D environments is crucial for advancing robotic learning and embodied intelligence. However, existing generative approaches often fail to capture the functional complexity of real-world interiors, particularly those containing articulated objects with movable parts essential for manipulation and navigation. This paper presents SceneFoundry, a language-guided diffusion framework that generates apartment-scale 3D worlds with functionally articulated furniture and semantically diverse layouts for robotic training. From natural language prompts, an LLM module controls floor layout generation, while diffusion-based posterior sampling efficiently populates the scene with articulated assets from large-scale 3D repositories. To ensure physical usability, SceneFoundry employs differentiable guidance functions to regulate object quantity, prevent articulation collisions, and maintain sufficient walkable space for robotic navigation.

### [12] [TAPM-Net: Trajectory-Aware Perturbation Modeling for Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05446)
*Hongyang Xie,Hongyang He,Victor Sanchez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAPM-Net uses trajectory-aware Mamba propagation to model spatial diffusion of target-induced feature disturbances for improved infrared small target detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ISTD models lack mechanisms to trace how small targets trigger directional, layer-wise perturbations in feature space, which is essential for distinguishing signals from structured noise in infrared scenes.

Method: Proposes Trajectory-Aware Mamba Propagation Network (TAPM-Net) with two components: Perturbation-guided Path Module (PGM) constructs perturbation energy fields and extracts gradient-following feature trajectories; Trajectory-Aware State Block (TASB) uses Mamba-based state-space to model dynamic propagation along trajectories with velocity-constrained diffusion and semantically aligned feature fusion.

Result: Experiments on NUAA-SIRST and IRSTD-1K datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in infrared small target detection.

Conclusion: TAPM-Net enables anisotropic, context-sensitive state transitions along spatial trajectories while maintaining global coherence at low computational cost, outperforming existing attention-based methods for ISTD.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) remains a long-standing challenge due to weak signal contrast, limited spatial extent, and cluttered backgrounds. Despite performance improvements from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), current models lack a mechanism to trace how small targets trigger directional, layer-wise perturbations in the feature space, which is an essential cue for distinguishing signal from structured noise in infrared scenes. To address this limitation, we propose the Trajectory-Aware Mamba Propagation Network (TAPM-Net), which explicitly models the spatial diffusion behavior of target-induced feature disturbances. TAPM-Net is built upon two novel components: a Perturbation-guided Path Module (PGM) and a Trajectory-Aware State Block (TASB). The PGM constructs perturbation energy fields from multi-level features and extracts gradient-following feature trajectories that reflect the directionality of local responses. The resulting feature trajectories are fed into the TASB, a Mamba-based state-space unit that models dynamic propagation along each trajectory while incorporating velocity-constrained diffusion and semantically aligned feature fusion from word-level and sentence-level embeddings. Unlike existing attention-based methods, TAPM-Net enables anisotropic, context-sensitive state transitions along spatial trajectories while maintaining global coherence at low computational cost. Experiments on NUAA-SIRST and IRSTD-1K demonstrate that TAPM-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance in ISTD.

*Nate Gillman,Yinghua Zhou,Zitian Tang,Evan Luo,Arjan Chakravarthy,Daksh Aggarwal,Michael Freeman,Charles Herrmann,Chen Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Goal Force: A video generation framework that uses force vectors and intermediate dynamics as goal specifications for physics-aware world models, enabling precise planning without external simulators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current world models struggle with goal specification - text is too abstract for physical nuances, while target images are infeasible for dynamic tasks. Need a more intuitive way to specify physical goals that humans naturally understand.

Method: Train video generation model on synthetic causal primitives (elastic collisions, falling dominos) to learn force propagation through time and space. Users define goals via explicit force vectors and intermediate dynamics.

Result: Model shows remarkable zero-shot generalization to complex real-world scenarios (tool manipulation, multi-object causal chains) despite being trained only on simple physics data. Emerges as implicit neural physics simulator.

Conclusion: Grounding video generation in fundamental physical interactions enables precise, physics-aware planning without external engines. Force-based goal specification provides intuitive control over physical dynamics.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have enabled the development of ``world models'' capable of simulating potential futures for robotics and planning. However, specifying precise goals for these models remains a challenge; text instructions are often too abstract to capture physical nuances, while target images are frequently infeasible to specify for dynamic tasks. To address this, we introduce Goal Force, a novel framework that allows users to define goals via explicit force vectors and intermediate dynamics, mirroring how humans conceptualize physical tasks. We train a video generation model on a curated dataset of synthetic causal primitives-such as elastic collisions and falling dominos-teaching it to propagate forces through time and space. Despite being trained on simple physics data, our model exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to complex, real-world scenarios, including tool manipulation and multi-object causal chains. Our results suggest that by grounding video generation in fundamental physical interactions, models can emerge as implicit neural physics simulators, enabling precise, physics-aware planning without reliance on external engines. We release all datasets, code, model weights, and interactive video demos at our project page.

*Tingwei Xie,Jinxin He,Yonghong Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ROAP is a lightweight pipeline that improves Layout Transformers for document understanding by modeling reading order and reducing visual noise, without modifying pre-trained backbones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal Transformers for document understanding have two key limitations: lack of explicit reading order modeling and visual token interference that dilutes textual semantics attention.

Method: ROAP pipeline uses Adaptive-XY-Gap (AXG-Tree) to extract hierarchical reading sequences, integrates them via Reading-Order-Aware Relative Position Bias (RO-RPB), and adds Textual-Token Sub-block Attention Prior (TT-Prior) to suppress visual noise.

Result: Extensive experiments on FUNSD and CORD benchmarks show ROAP consistently improves performance of LayoutLMv3 and GeoLayoutLM backbones.

Conclusion: Explicit reading order modeling and modality interference regulation are critical for robust document understanding, offering a scalable solution for complex layout analysis.

Abstract: The efficacy of Multimodal Transformers in visually-rich document understanding (VrDU) is critically constrained by two inherent limitations: the lack of explicit modeling for logical reading order and the interference of visual tokens that dilutes attention on textual semantics.
  To address these challenges, this paper presents ROAP, a lightweight and architecture-agnostic pipeline designed to optimize attention distributions in Layout Transformers without altering their pre-trained backbones.
  The proposed pipeline first employs an Adaptive-XY-Gap (AXG-Tree) to robustly extract hierarchical reading sequences from complex layouts. These sequences are then integrated into the attention mechanism via a Reading-Order-Aware Relative Position Bias (RO-RPB). Furthermore, a Textual-Token Sub-block Attention Prior (TT-Prior) is introduced to adaptively suppress visual noise and enhance fine-grained text-text interactions.
  Extensive experiments on the FUNSD and CORD benchmarks demonstrate that ROAP consistently improves the performance of representative backbones, including LayoutLMv3 and GeoLayoutLM.
  These findings confirm that explicitly modeling reading logic and regulating modality interference are critical for robust document understanding, offering a scalable solution for complex layout analysis. The implementation code will be released at https://github.com/KevinYuLei/ROAP.

TL;DR: Novel underground imaging system using multi-view capture and deep learning MISR to enhance root visibility for accurate trait quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate imaging of plant roots in subterranean environments is challenging due to occlusion, soil moisture variations, and low contrast, limiting conventional vision-based approaches for studying soil-plant interactions and nutrient uptake.

Method: Proposed underground imaging system captures multiple overlapping views of plant roots and integrates a deep learning-based Multi-Image Super Resolution (MISR) framework that leverages spatial redundancy across views to reconstruct high-resolution images with improved structural fidelity.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art super resolution baselines with 2.3% reduction in BRISQUE (indicating improved image quality) while maintaining same CLIP-IQA score, enabling enhanced phenotypic analysis and accurate estimation of root traits like root hair count and density.

Conclusion: The framework presents a promising direction for robust automatic underground plant root imaging and trait quantification for agricultural and ecological research, facilitating better understanding of root systems.

Abstract: Understanding plant root systems is critical for advancing research in soil-plant interactions, nutrient uptake, and overall plant health. However, accurate imaging of roots in subterranean environments remains a persistent challenge due to adverse conditions such as occlusion, varying soil moisture, and inherently low contrast, which limit the effectiveness of conventional vision-based approaches. In this work, we propose a novel underground imaging system that captures multiple overlapping views of plant roots and integrates a deep learning-based Multi-Image Super Resolution (MISR) framework designed to enhance root visibility and detail. To train and evaluate our approach, we construct a synthetic dataset that simulates realistic underground imaging scenarios, incorporating key environmental factors that affect image quality. Our proposed MISR algorithm leverages spatial redundancy across views to reconstruct high-resolution images with improved structural fidelity and visual clarity. Quantitative evaluations show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art super resolution baselines, achieving a 2.3 percent reduction in BRISQUE, indicating improved image quality with the same CLIP-IQA score, thereby enabling enhanced phenotypic analysis of root systems. This, in turn, facilitates accurate estimation of critical root traits, including root hair count and root hair density. The proposed framework presents a promising direction for robust automatic underground plant root imaging and trait quantification for agricultural and ecological research.

*Trishna Niraula*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hippocampal atrophy is a key feature of Alzheimer's disease progression, showing significant volume loss in AD vs controls, moderate predictive value for MCI-to-AD conversion, and no significant APOE4 genetic effects on cross-sectional volume.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate gray matter loss patterns in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment, particularly in medial temporal structures, and to examine hippocampal atrophy as a biomarker for disease progression and genetic influences.

Method: Used CAT12/SPM12 voxel-based morphometry on baseline T1-weighted MRI scans from 249 ADNI participants (90 controls, 129 MCI, 30 AD). Analyzed gray matter volume with general linear model, diagnostic group as primary predictor, age and total intracranial volume as covariates. Statistical maps thresholded at p<0.001 voxelwise with FWE cluster correction p<0.05.

Result: Significant hippocampal atrophy in AD vs controls (Cohen's d=2.03) and vs MCI (d=1.61). Hippocampal volume showed moderate predictive value for MCI-to-AD conversion (AUC=0.66). APOE4 stratification revealed no significant genetic effects on cross-sectional hippocampal volume.

Conclusion: Medial temporal degeneration is a key feature of AD progression, hippocampal volume has moderate predictive value for disease conversion, and APOE4 status doesn't significantly affect cross-sectional hippocampal volume measurements.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are associated with progressive gray matter loss, particularly in medial temporal structures. In this study, CAT12/SPM12 voxel-based morphometry was applied to baseline T1-weighted MRI scans from 249 ADNI participants (CN = 90, MCI = 129, AD = 30). Gray matter volume was analyzed using a general linear model, with the diagnostic group as primary predictor and age and total intracranial volume as covariates. Statistical maps were thresholded at p < 0.001 (voxelwise) and corrected for multiple comparisons at the cluster level using family-wise error (FWE) correction (p < 0.05). Significant hippocampal atrophy was observed in AD relative to CN and MCI (Cohen's d = 2.03 and 1.61, respectively). Hippocampal volume demonstrated moderate predictive value for conversion from MCI to AD (AUC = 0.66). Stratification by APOE4 status did not reveal significant genetic effects on cross-sectional hippocampal volume. These results support medial temporal degeneration as a key feature of AD progression and provide insights into predictive biomarkers and genetic influences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with long videos due to computational expense of direct encoding and the redundancy/fragmentation of simple video-to-text conversion. Long videos have complex events, diverse scenes, and long-range dependencies that need better handling.

Method: MMViR identifies key turning points to segment videos and constructs a three-level description that couples global narratives with fine-grained visual details. This multi-modal, multi-grained structured representation supports efficient query-based retrieval.

Result: MMViR outperforms prior strongest methods across QA, summarization, and retrieval tasks, achieving 19.67% improvement in hour-long video understanding while reducing processing latency to 45.4% of the original.

Conclusion: MMViR provides an effective structured representation for long video understanding that generalizes well across various scenarios, addressing the computational and content quality challenges of processing lengthy videos.

Abstract: Long videos, ranging from minutes to hours, present significant challenges for current Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) due to their complex events, diverse scenes, and long-range dependencies. Direct encoding of such videos is computationally too expensive, while simple video-to-text conversion often results in redundant or fragmented content. To address these limitations, we introduce MMViR, a novel multi-modal, multi-grained structured representation for long video understanding. MMViR identifies key turning points to segment the video and constructs a three-level description that couples global narratives with fine-grained visual details. This design supports efficient query-based retrieval and generalizes well across various scenarios. Extensive evaluations across three tasks, including QA, summarization, and retrieval, show that MMViR outperforms the prior strongest method, achieving a 19.67% improvement in hour-long video understanding while reducing processing latency to 45.4% of the original.

Motivation: Accurate tumor segmentation and classification in breast ultrasound imaging is challenging due to low contrast, speckle noise, and diverse lesion morphology, requiring improved methods for clinical diagnosis.

Method: Prompt-free, fully supervised adaptation of Segment Anything Model (SAM) vision encoder embeddings, decoded through lightweight convolutional head or UNet-inspired decoder for segmentation, with classification enhanced via mask-guided attention to focus on lesion features.

Result: Achieved Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.887 and accuracy of 92.3% on PRECISE 2025 breast ultrasound dataset, ranking among top entries on the challenge leaderboard.

Conclusion: SAM-based representations coupled with segmentation-guided learning significantly improve both lesion delineation and diagnostic prediction in breast ultrasound imaging.

Abstract: Accurate tumor segmentation and classification in breast ultrasound (BUS) imaging remain challenging due to low contrast, speckle noise, and diverse lesion morphology. This study presents a multi-task deep learning framework that jointly performs lesion segmentation and diagnostic classification using embeddings from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) vision encoder. Unlike prompt-based SAM variants, our approach employs a prompt-free, fully supervised adaptation where high-dimensional SAM features are decoded through either a lightweight convolutional head or a UNet-inspired decoder for pixel-wise segmentation. The classification branch is enhanced via mask-guided attention, allowing the model to focus on lesion-relevant features while suppressing background artifacts. Experiments on the PRECISE 2025 breast ultrasound dataset, split per class into 80 percent training and 20 percent testing, show that the proposed method achieves a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.887 and an accuracy of 92.3 percent, ranking among the top entries on the PRECISE challenge leaderboard. These results demonstrate that SAM-based representations, when coupled with segmentation-guided learning, significantly improve both lesion delineation and diagnostic prediction in breast ultrasound imaging.

TL;DR: HieroSA enables MLLMs to automatically analyze stroke-level structures of logographic characters without handcrafted data, transforming character images into interpretable line-segment representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs and MLLMs fail to capture the structural logic of character strokes in hieroglyphic writing systems, treating them only as tokens or pixel grids. Existing structural analysis methods are script-specific and labor-intensive.

Method: Proposes Hieroglyphic Stroke Analyzer (HieroSA), a generalizable framework that automatically derives stroke-level structures from character bitmaps, transforming them into explicit line-segment representations in normalized coordinate space.

Result: HieroSA effectively captures character-internal structures and semantics without language-specific priors, demonstrating cross-lingual generalization capabilities for both modern logographic and ancient hieroglyphic scripts.

Conclusion: The framework serves as a powerful graphematics analysis tool for deeper understanding of hieroglyphic scripts, offering automated structural analysis that bypasses traditional labor-intensive methods.

Abstract: Hieroglyphs, as logographic writing systems, encode rich semantic and cultural information within their internal structural composition. Yet, current advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) usually remain structurally blind to this information. LLMs process characters as textual tokens, while MLLMs additionally view them as raw pixel grids. Both fall short to model the underlying logic of character strokes. Furthermore, existing structural analysis methods are often script-specific and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose Hieroglyphic Stroke Analyzer (HieroSA), a novel and generalizable framework that enables MLLMs to automatically derive stroke-level structures from character bitmaps without handcrafted data. It transforms modern logographic and ancient hieroglyphs character images into explicit, interpretable line-segment representations in a normalized coordinate space, allowing for cross-lingual generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HieroSA effectively captures character-internal structures and semantics, bypassing the need for language-specific priors. Experimental results highlight the potential of our work as a graphematics analysis tool for a deeper understanding of hieroglyphic scripts. View our code at https://github.com/THUNLP-MT/HieroSA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaussianSwap is a video face swapping framework that creates 3D Gaussian Splatting avatars from target videos while transferring identity from source images, enabling interactive manipulation rather than just pixel-based output.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video face swapping methods produce only pixel-based representations without animation or interactive manipulation capabilities. There's a need to shift from conventional pixel-based video generation to creating high-fidelity avatars with swapped faces that can be controlled and animated.

Method: 1) Preprocess target video to extract FLAME parameters, camera poses, and segmentation masks; 2) Rig 3D Gaussian splats to the FLAME model across frames for dynamic facial control; 3) Use compound identity embedding from three state-of-the-art face recognition models for avatar finetuning; 4) Render face-swapped avatar on background frames.

Result: GaussianSwap achieves superior identity preservation, visual clarity, and temporal consistency compared to conventional methods, while enabling previously unattainable interactive applications.

Conclusion: The framework represents a paradigm shift from pixel-based video generation to creating high-fidelity avatars with swapped faces, offering both improved quality and new interactive capabilities for video face swapping.

Abstract: We introduce GaussianSwap, a novel video face swapping framework that constructs a 3D Gaussian Splatting based face avatar from a target video while transferring identity from a source image to the avatar. Conventional video swapping frameworks are limited to generating facial representations in pixel-based formats. The resulting swapped faces exist merely as a set of unstructured pixels without any capacity for animation or interactive manipulation. Our work introduces a paradigm shift from conventional pixel-based video generation to the creation of high-fidelity avatar with swapped faces. The framework first preprocesses target video to extract FLAME parameters, camera poses and segmentation masks, and then rigs 3D Gaussian splats to the FLAME model across frames, enabling dynamic facial control. To ensure identity preserving, we propose an compound identity embedding constructed from three state-of-the-art face recognition models for avatar finetuning. Finally, we render the face-swapped avatar on the background frames to obtain the face-swapped video. Experimental results demonstrate that GaussianSwap achieves superior identity preservation, visual clarity and temporal consistency, while enabling previously unattainable interactive applications.

Conclusion: The proposed SAS-VPReID framework effectively addresses extreme far-distance VPReID challenges through complementary modules for visual feature extraction, multi-scale temporal modeling, and shape dynamics regularization, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Video-based Person Re-IDentification (VPReID) aims to retrieve the same person from videos captured by non-overlapping cameras. At extreme far distances, VPReID is highly challenging due to severe resolution degradation, drastic viewpoint variation and inevitable appearance noise. To address these issues, we propose a Scale-Adaptive framework with Shape Priors for VPReID, named SAS-VPReID. The framework is built upon three complementary modules. First, we deploy a Memory-Enhanced Visual Backbone (MEVB) to extract discriminative feature representations, which leverages the CLIP vision encoder and multi-proxy memory. Second, we propose a Multi-Granularity Temporal Modeling (MGTM) to construct sequences at multiple temporal granularities and adaptively emphasize motion cues across scales. Third, we incorporate Prior-Regularized Shape Dynamics (PRSD) to capture body structure dynamics. With these modules, our framework can obtain more discriminative feature representations.

TL;DR: DIFF-MF: A difference-driven channel-spatial state space model for multi-modal image fusion that uses feature discrepancy maps to guide fusion, achieving better balance between infrared intensity and visible details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing state space model approaches for multi-modal image fusion tend to either over-prioritize infrared intensity at the cost of visible details, or preserve visible structure while diminishing thermal target salience, creating an imbalance in feature integration.

Method: DIFF-MF leverages feature discrepancy maps between modalities to guide feature extraction, followed by dual fusion processes: channel-exchange module with cross-attention dual state space modeling for adaptive feature reweighting, and spatial-exchange module with cross-modal state space scanning for comprehensive spatial fusion.

Result: Experimental results on driving scenarios and low-altitude UAV datasets demonstrate that DIFF-MF outperforms existing approaches in both visual quality and quantitative evaluation, effectively integrating complementary multi-modal features while maintaining linear computational complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed DIFF-MF model successfully addresses the imbalance problem in multi-modal image fusion by using difference-driven guidance and dual channel-spatial fusion mechanisms, achieving superior performance in integrating complementary information from multiple source images.

Abstract: Multi-modal image fusion aims to integrate complementary information from multiple source images to produce high-quality fused images with enriched content. Although existing approaches based on state space model have achieved satisfied performance with high computational efficiency, they tend to either over-prioritize infrared intensity at the cost of visible details, or conversely, preserve visible structure while diminishing thermal target salience. To overcome these challenges, we propose DIFF-MF, a novel difference-driven channel-spatial state space model for multi-modal image fusion. Our approach leverages feature discrepancy maps between modalities to guide feature extraction, followed by a fusion process across both channel and spatial dimensions. In the channel dimension, a channel-exchange module enhances channel-wise interaction through cross-attention dual state space modeling, enabling adaptive feature reweighting. In the spatial dimension, a spatial-exchange module employs cross-modal state space scanning to achieve comprehensive spatial fusion. By efficiently capturing global dependencies while maintaining linear computational complexity, DIFF-MF effectively integrates complementary multi-modal features. Experimental results on the driving scenarios and low-altitude UAV datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both visual quality and quantitative evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-object generation methods struggle with precise semantic alignment, leading to inconsistent object quantities and attribute aliasing. Current approaches rely on rigid external control signals that limit flexibility and accessibility for users with diverse constraints.

Method: Two key modules: 1) Regional Semantic Anchor (RSA) that anchors phrase units to corresponding image regions for quantity-accurate generation, and 2) Adaptive Multi-modal Guidance (AMG) that parses and integrates multi-source control signals into structured intent for selective fine-grained control.

Result: MoGen significantly outperforms existing methods in generation quality, quantity consistency, and fine-grained control, while demonstrating superior accessibility and control flexibility.

Conclusion: MoGen provides a flexible, user-friendly solution for multi-object image generation that achieves precise semantic alignment without rigid control dependencies, making it adaptable to diverse user needs and resource conditions.

Abstract: Existing multi-object image generation methods face difficulties in achieving precise alignment between localized image generation regions and their corresponding semantics based on language descriptions, frequently resulting in inconsistent object quantities and attribute aliasing. To mitigate this limitation, mainstream approaches typically rely on external control signals to explicitly constrain the spatial layout, local semantic and visual attributes of images. However, this strong dependency makes the input format rigid, rendering it incompatible with the heterogeneous resource conditions of users and diverse constraint requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MoGen, a user-friendly multi-object image generation method. First, we design a Regional Semantic Anchor (RSA) module that precisely anchors phrase units in language descriptions to their corresponding image regions during the generation process, enabling text-to-image generation that follows quantity specifications for multiple objects. Building upon this foundation, we further introduce an Adaptive Multi-modal Guidance (AMG) module, which adaptively parses and integrates various combinations of multi-source control signals to formulate corresponding structured intent. This intent subsequently guides selective constraints on scene layouts and object attributes, achieving dynamic fine-grained control. Experimental results demonstrate that MoGen significantly outperforms existing methods in generation quality, quantity consistency, and fine-grained control, while exhibiting superior accessibility and control flexibility.

TL;DR: VIB-Probe uses Variational Information Bottleneck theory to detect and mitigate hallucinations in Vision-Language Models by analyzing internal attention heads and filtering out semantic noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models suffer from hallucinations where generated text deviates from visual content, and existing detection methods overlook internal mechanisms by relying on output logits or external tools.

Method: Proposes VIB-Probe framework that applies Variational Information Bottleneck theory to extract discriminative patterns from attention heads while filtering semantic noise, and uses gradient analysis to identify causal attention heads for inference-time intervention.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks show VIB-Probe significantly outperforms existing baselines in both hallucination detection and mitigation settings.

Conclusion: VIB-Probe provides an effective framework for understanding and addressing hallucinations in VLMs by leveraging internal attention mechanisms through information bottleneck principles, with code to be made publicly available.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in multimodal tasks, but remain susceptible to hallucinations, where generated text deviates from the underlying visual content. Existing hallucination detection methods primarily rely on output logits or external verification tools, often overlooking their internal mechanisms. In this work, we investigate the outputs of internal attention heads, postulating that specific heads carry the primary signals for truthful generation.However, directly probing these high-dimensional states is challenging due to the entanglement of visual-linguistic syntax and noise. To address this, we propose VIB-Probe, a novel hallucination detection and mitigation framework leveraging the Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) theory. Our method extracts discriminative patterns across layers and heads while filtering out semantic nuisances through the information bottleneck principle. Furthermore, by leveraging the gradients of our VIB probe, we identify attention heads with strong causal influence on hallucinations and introduce an inference-time intervention strategy for hallucination mitigation. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that VIB-Probe significantly outperforms existing baselines in both settings. Our code will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual-language foundation model approaches for universal anomaly detection suffer from complex prompt engineering, elaborate adaptation modules, and challenging training strategies, limiting their flexibility and generality.

Method: Proposes UniADet that completely decouples classification and segmentation tasks, and decouples cross-level features by learning independent weights for different tasks and hierarchical features, eliminating the need for language encoder.

Result: Surpasses state-of-the-art zero-/few-shot methods by large margins and even outperforms full-shot AD methods for the first time on 14 real-world AD benchmarks covering industrial and medical domains, with only 0.002M learnable parameters.

Conclusion: UniADet demonstrates that a simple, decoupled weight learning approach without language encoder is highly effective for universal anomaly detection, offering superior performance with minimal parameters and maximum flexibility.

Abstract: Universal visual anomaly detection (AD) aims to identify anomaly images and segment anomaly regions towards open and dynamic scenarios, following zero- and few-shot paradigms without any dataset-specific fine-tuning. We have witnessed significant progress in widely use of visual-language foundational models in recent approaches. However, current methods often struggle with complex prompt engineering, elaborate adaptation modules, and challenging training strategies, ultimately limiting their flexibility and generality. To address these issues, this paper rethinks the fundamental mechanism behind visual-language models for AD and presents an embarrassingly simple, general, and effective framework for Universal vision Anomaly Detection (UniADet). Specifically, we first find language encoder is used to derive decision weights for anomaly classification and segmentation, and then demonstrate that it is unnecessary for universal AD. Second, we propose an embarrassingly simple method to completely decouple classification and segmentation, and decouple cross-level features, i.e., learning independent weights for different tasks and hierarchical features. UniADet is highly simple (learning only decoupled weights), parameter-efficient (only 0.002M learnable parameters), general (adapting a variety of foundation models), and effective (surpassing state-of-the-art zero-/few-shot by a large margin and even full-shot AD methods for the first time) on 14 real-world AD benchmarks covering both industrial and medical domains. We will make the code and model of UniADet available at https://github.com/gaobb/UniADet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Facial expression recognition is important for human-computer interaction, but labeled data is costly to acquire, making semi-supervised approaches crucial for leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data efficiently.

Method: Combines local attention enhancement and random feature map dropout during feature extraction, plus Dynamic Threshold Adjustment for semi-supervised learning and Selective Negative Learning to utilize low-confidence unlabeled samples through complementary label mining.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on RAF-DB and AffectNet datasets, surpassing fully supervised methods even without using the entire dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed semi-supervised approach with DTA and SNL effectively leverages limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data, proving to be an efficient solution for facial expression recognition with reduced annotation costs.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition is a key task in human-computer interaction and affective computing. However, acquiring a large amount of labeled facial expression data is often costly. Therefore, it is particularly important to design a semi-supervised facial expression recognition algorithm that makes full use of both labeled and unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised facial expression recognition algorithm based on Dynamic Threshold Adjustment (DTA) and Selective Negative Learning (SNL). Initially, we designed strategies for local attention enhancement and random dropout of feature maps during feature extraction, which strengthen the representation of local features while ensuring the model does not overfit to any specific local area. Furthermore, this study introduces a dynamic thresholding method to adapt to the requirements of the semi-supervised learning framework for facial expression recognition tasks, and through a selective negative learning strategy, it fully utilizes unlabeled samples with low confidence by mining useful expression information from complementary labels, achieving impressive results. We have achieved state-of-the-art performance on the RAF-DB and AffectNet datasets. Our method surpasses fully supervised methods even without using the entire dataset, which proves the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pipeline to detect and correct misleading social media news previews (image-headline pairs) that omit crucial context, causing interpretation drift from full articles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social media news previews can be covertly misleading by selectively omitting context, causing readers to form judgments that diverge from the full article. This omission-based misleadingness is harder to detect than explicit misinformation and remains underexplored.

Method: Developed a multi-stage pipeline to disentangle preview-based vs. context-based understanding, constructing the MM-Misleading benchmark. Proposed OMGuard with two components: (1) Interpretation-Aware Fine-Tuning to improve multimodal misleadingness detection, and (2) Rationale-Guided Misleading Content Correction using explicit rationales to guide headline rewriting.

Result: OMGuard lifts an 8B model's detection accuracy to match a 235B LVLM and delivers stronger end-to-end correction. Analysis reveals misleadingness typically stems from local narrative shifts (e.g., missing background) rather than global frame changes, and identifies image-driven scenarios where text-only correction fails.

Conclusion: The work addresses the underexplored problem of omission-based misleadingness in social media previews, providing a benchmark and solution (OMGuard) that significantly improves detection and correction, highlighting the necessity of visual interventions in some cases.

Abstract: Even when factually correct, social-media news previews (image-headline pairs) can induce interpretation drift: by selectively omitting crucial context, they lead readers to form judgments that diverge from what the full article conveys. This covert harm is harder to detect than explicit misinformation yet remains underexplored. To address this gap, we develop a multi-stage pipeline that disentangles and simulates preview-based versus context-based understanding, enabling construction of the MM-Misleading benchmark. Using this benchmark, we systematically evaluate open-source LVLMs and uncover pronounced blind spots to omission-based misleadingness detection. We further propose OMGuard, which integrates (1) Interpretation-Aware Fine-Tuning, which used to improve multimodal misleadingness detection and (2) Rationale-Guided Misleading Content Correction, which uses explicit rationales to guide headline rewriting and reduce misleading impressions. Experiments show that OMGuard lifts an 8B model's detection accuracy to match a 235B LVLM and delivers markedly stronger end-to-end correction. Further analysis reveals that misleadingness typically stems from local narrative shifts (e.g., missing background) rather than global frame changes, and identifies image-driven scenarios where text-only correction fails, highlighting the necessity of visual interventions.

TL;DR: A scalable multi-image editing framework for Unified Multimodal Models that improves visual consistency and disambiguation across multiple input images using learnable latent separators and sinusoidal index encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have limitations in maintaining visual consistency and disambiguating visual cues when referencing details across multiple input images, which hinders effective multi-image editing.

Method: Two key innovations: 1) Learnable latent separators that explicitly differentiate each reference image in latent space for accurate disentangled conditioning. 2) Sinusoidal index encoding that assigns visual tokens from the same image continuous sinusoidal embeddings to provide explicit image identity while allowing generalization to variable input counts.

Result: Experiments show clear improvements in semantic consistency, visual fidelity, and cross-image integration over prior baselines on diverse multi-image editing tasks, validating advantages in consistency and generalization ability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses UMM limitations in multi-image editing by explicitly distinguishing image identities and generalizing to variable input counts, establishing a scalable solution with demonstrated improvements across key metrics.

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) integrate multimodal understanding and generation, yet they are limited to maintaining visual consistency and disambiguating visual cues when referencing details across multiple input images. In this work, we propose a scalable multi-image editing framework for UMMs that explicitly distinguishes image identities and generalizes to variable input counts. Algorithmically, we introduce two innovations: 1) The learnable latent separators explicitly differentiate each reference image in the latent space, enabling accurate and disentangled conditioning. 2) The sinusoidal index encoding assigns visual tokens from the same image a continuous sinusoidal index embedding, which provides explicit image identity while allowing generalization and extrapolation on a variable number of inputs. To facilitate training and evaluation, we establish a high-fidelity benchmark using an inverse dataset construction methodology to guarantee artifact-free, achievable outputs. Experiments show clear improvements in semantic consistency, visual fidelity, and cross-image integration over prior baselines on diverse multi-image editing tasks, validating our advantages on consistency and generalization ability.

Conclusion: Orient Anything V2 significantly broadens the applicability of orientation estimation in diverse downstream tasks through improved handling of rotational symmetries and direct relative rotation estimation.

Abstract: This work presents Orient Anything V2, an enhanced foundation model for unified understanding of object 3D orientation and rotation from single or paired images. Building upon Orient Anything V1, which defines orientation via a single unique front face, V2 extends this capability to handle objects with diverse rotational symmetries and directly estimate relative rotations. These improvements are enabled by four key innovations: 1) Scalable 3D assets synthesized by generative models, ensuring broad category coverage and balanced data distribution; 2) An efficient, model-in-the-loop annotation system that robustly identifies 0 to N valid front faces for each object; 3) A symmetry-aware, periodic distribution fitting objective that captures all plausible front-facing orientations, effectively modeling object rotational symmetry; 4) A multi-frame architecture that directly predicts relative object rotations. Extensive experiments show that Orient Anything V2 achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on orientation estimation, 6DoF pose estimation, and object symmetry recognition across 11 widely used benchmarks. The model demonstrates strong generalization, significantly broadening the applicability of orientation estimation in diverse downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A three-stage domain continual learning framework for AI-generated image detection that adapts to evolving generative models through parameter-efficient fine-tuning, continual learning with data augmentation, and linear interpolation for model commonality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-generated images threaten online information authenticity, but current detection methods struggle to generalize to unseen generative models and can't adapt to rapidly evolving generation techniques, risking real-world ineffectiveness.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) Parameter-efficient fine-tuning for transferable offline detection; 2) Continual learning with data augmentation chain and K-FAC method to prevent catastrophic forgetting; 3) Linear interpolation based on Linear Mode Connectivity to capture commonalities across models.

Result: Offline detectors outperform leading baseline by +5.51% mean average precision; continual learning achieves 92.20% average accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on benchmark of 27 generative models (GANs, deepfakes, diffusion models).

Conclusion: The proposed continual learning framework effectively addresses the adaptability challenge in AI-generated image detection, maintaining high performance as generative models evolve, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: The malicious misuse and widespread dissemination of AI-generated images pose a significant threat to the authenticity of online information. Current detection methods often struggle to generalize to unseen generative models, and the rapid evolution of generative techniques continuously exacerbates this challenge. Without adaptability, detection models risk becoming ineffective in real-world applications. To address this critical issue, we propose a novel three-stage domain continual learning framework designed for continuous adaptation to evolving generative models. In the first stage, we employ a strategic parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach to develop a transferable offline detection model with strong generalization capabilities. Building upon this foundation, the second stage integrates unseen data streams into a continual learning process. To efficiently learn from limited samples of novel generated models and mitigate overfitting, we design a data augmentation chain with progressively increasing complexity. Furthermore, we leverage the Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC) method to approximate the Hessian and alleviate catastrophic forgetting. Finally, the third stage utilizes a linear interpolation strategy based on Linear Mode Connectivity, effectively capturing commonalities across diverse generative models and further enhancing overall performance. We establish a comprehensive benchmark of 27 generative models, including GANs, deepfakes, and diffusion models, chronologically structured up to August 2024 to simulate real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our initial offline detectors surpass the leading baseline by +5.51% in terms of mean average precision. Our continual learning strategy achieves an average accuracy of 92.20%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of balancing model convergence rate and rendering quality in 3D dynamic scene reconstruction, especially for scenes with complex dynamic motions where high-precision modeling is needed.

Method: Proposes GS-DMSR method with two key components: 1) Adaptive gradient focusing mechanism that analyzes dynamic evolution of Gaussian attributes to identify motion state differences and apply differentiated optimization strategies, and 2) Multi-scale manifold enhancement module using collaborative optimization of implicit nonlinear decoder and explicit deformation field for complex deformation scenes.

Result: Achieves up to 96 FPS on synthetic datasets while effectively reducing both storage overhead and training time compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed GS-DMSR method successfully addresses the trade-off between convergence rate and rendering quality in 3D dynamic scene reconstruction, offering improved efficiency for complex dynamic scenes through adaptive optimization strategies and manifold enhancement.

Abstract: In the field of 3D dynamic scene reconstruction, how to balance model convergence rate and rendering quality has long been a critical challenge that urgently needs to be addressed, particularly in high-precision modeling of scenes with complex dynamic motions. To tackle this issue, this study proposes the GS-DMSR method. By quantitatively analyzing the dynamic evolution process of Gaussian attributes, this mechanism achieves adaptive gradient focusing, enabling it to dynamically identify significant differences in the motion states of Gaussian models. It then applies differentiated optimization strategies to Gaussian models with varying degrees of significance, thereby significantly improving the model convergence rate. Additionally, this research integrates a multi-scale manifold enhancement module, which leverages the collaborative optimization of an implicit nonlinear decoder and an explicit deformation field to enhance the modeling efficiency for complex deformation scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that this method achieves a frame rate of up to 96 FPS on synthetic datasets, while effectively reducing both storage overhead and training time.Our code and data are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GS-DMSR-2212.

### [32] [Quantifying and Inducing Shape Bias in CNNs via Max-Pool Dilation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05599)
*Takito Sawada,Akinori Iwata,Masahiro Okuda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a metric to quantify dataset shape-texture balance and a dilation-based method to enhance CNN shape bias without retraining convolutional weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs have inherent texture bias that hurts performance on shape-dominant data like illustrations. Existing shape-biased models lack quantitative metrics to identify which datasets would benefit from such modifications.

Method: 1) Data-driven metric using SSIM between image luminance and L0-smoothed version to quantify shape-texture balance. 2) Efficient adaptation method modifying max-pooling dilation to promote shape bias while keeping convolutional weights frozen.

Result: Approach consistently improves classification accuracy on shape-dominant datasets, especially in low-data regimes where full fine-tuning is impractical. Only requires training the final classification layer.

Conclusion: Provides both a diagnostic metric for dataset shape-texture balance and an efficient adaptation method that enhances CNN performance on shape-dominant data without expensive retraining.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are known to exhibit a strong texture bias, favoring local patterns over global shape information--a tendency inherent to their convolutional architecture. While this bias is beneficial for texture-rich natural images, it often degrades performance on shape-dominant data such as illustrations and sketches. Although prior work has proposed shape-biased models to mitigate this issue, these approaches lack a quantitative metric for identifying which datasets would actually benefit from such modifications. To address this gap, we propose a data-driven metric that quantifies the shape-texture balance of a dataset by computing the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) between each image's luminance channel and its L0-smoothed counterpart. Building on this metric, we further introduce a computationally efficient adaptation method that promotes shape bias by modifying the dilation of max-pooling operations while keeping convolutional weights frozen. Experimental results show that this approach consistently improves classification accuracy on shape-dominant datasets, particularly in low-data regimes where full fine-tuning is impractical, requiring training only the final classification layer.

*Chuhan Wang,Xintong Li,Jennifer Yuntong Zhang,Junda Wu,Chengkai Huang,Lina Yao,Julian McAuley,Jingbo Shang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneAlign improves multimodal reasoning by using scene graphs to create hard negative examples that force models to ground reasoning in visual facts, reducing hallucinations and improving faithfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs struggle with faithful reasoning in complex visual scenes, often hallucinating entities, mis-grounding relations, skipping steps, or over-specifying. Existing preference-based approaches fail because models can exploit language priors to bypass visual grounding.

Method: SceneAlign uses scene graphs as structured visual information to perform controllable structural interventions. It identifies reasoning-critical nodes and perturbs them through four targeted strategies that mimic typical grounding failures, creating hard negative rationales that are linguistically plausible but visually inaccurate. These contrastive pairs are used in Direct Preference Optimization.

Result: Across seven visual reasoning benchmarks, SceneAlign consistently improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: Grounding-aware alignment using structured visual information (scene graphs) is effective for improving multimodal reasoning faithfulness, addressing the core challenge of visual grounding that previous methods failed to solve.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models often struggle with faithful reasoning in complex visual scenes, where intricate entities and relations require precise visual grounding at each step. This reasoning unfaithfulness frequently manifests as hallucinated entities, mis-grounded relations, skipped steps, and over-specified reasoning. Existing preference-based approaches, typically relying on textual perturbations or answer-conditioned rationales, fail to address this challenge as they allow models to exploit language priors to bypass visual grounding. To address this, we propose SceneAlign, a framework that leverages scene graphs as structured visual information to perform controllable structural interventions. By identifying reasoning-critical nodes and perturbing them through four targeted strategies that mimic typical grounding failures, SceneAlign constructs hard negative rationales that remain linguistically plausible but are grounded in inaccurate visual facts. These contrastive pairs are used in Direct Preference Optimization to steer models toward fine-grained, structure-faithful reasoning. Across seven visual reasoning benchmarks, SceneAlign consistently improves answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, highlighting the effectiveness of grounding-aware alignment for multimodal reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RRS-Gait proposes a geometric transformation invariance framework for gait recognition, treating gait variations as combinations of Reflect, Rotate, and Scale transformations to achieve identity invariance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most gait recognition models implicitly learn common traits across different conditions, but few explicitly explore inherent relations between gait conditions. The paper aims to establish connections among different gait conditions by viewing variations as geometric transformations.

Method: Proposes RRS-Gait framework that explores three geometric transformations (Reflect, Rotate, Scale). It adjusts convolution kernels based on specific transformations to achieve approximate feature equivariance, then feeds equivariant-aware features into global pooling for invariance-aware learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on four popular gait datasets (Gait3D, GREW, CCPG, SUSTech1K) show superior performance across various gait conditions.

Conclusion: Gait variations can be effectively modeled as geometric transformations, and achieving geometric invariance through the RRS framework naturally leads to identity invariance, providing a new perspective for gait recognition.

Abstract: The goal of gait recognition is to extract identity-invariant features of an individual under various gait conditions, e.g., cross-view and cross-clothing. Most gait models strive to implicitly learn the common traits across different gait conditions in a data-driven manner to pull different gait conditions closer for recognition. However, relatively few studies have explicitly explored the inherent relations between different gait conditions. For this purpose, we attempt to establish connections among different gait conditions and propose a new perspective to achieve gait recognition: variations in different gait conditions can be approximately viewed as a combination of geometric transformations. In this case, all we need is to determine the types of geometric transformations and achieve geometric invariance, then identity invariance naturally follows. As an initial attempt, we explore three common geometric transformations (i.e., Reflect, Rotate, and Scale) and design a $\mathcal{R}$eflect-$\mathcal{R}$otate-$\mathcal{S}$cale invariance learning framework, named ${\mathcal{RRS}}$-Gait. Specifically, it first flexibly adjusts the convolution kernel based on the specific geometric transformations to achieve approximate feature equivariance. Then these three equivariant-aware features are respectively fed into a global pooling operation for final invariance-aware learning. Extensive experiments on four popular gait datasets (Gait3D, GREW, CCPG, SUSTech1K) show superior performance across various gait conditions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current end-to-end autonomous driving models struggle with rare, long-tail scenarios due to limited data diversity.

Conclusion: LatentVLA successfully addresses key limitations of current VLA models by eliminating linguistic bias through self-supervised learning, achieving both robust performance in rare scenarios and real-time efficiency suitable for practical deployment.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving models trained on largescale datasets perform well in common scenarios but struggle with rare, long-tail situations due to limited scenario diversity. Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage broad knowledge from pre-trained visionlanguage models to address this limitation, yet face critical challenges: (1) numerical imprecision in trajectory prediction due to discrete tokenization, (2) heavy reliance on language annotations that introduce linguistic bias and annotation burden, and (3) computational inefficiency from multi-step chain-of-thought reasoning hinders real-time deployment. We propose LatentVLA, a novel framework that employs self-supervised latent action prediction to train VLA models without language annotations, eliminating linguistic bias while learning rich driving representations from unlabeled trajectory data. Through knowledge distillation, LatentVLA transfers the generalization capabilities of VLA models to efficient vision-based networks, achieving both robust performance and real-time efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning image compression models achieve high quality but are complex, heavyweight, and require substantial resources, making them impractical for hardware-constrained applications.

Method: Uses simplified knowledge distillation to approximate the latent space of original heavyweight models with less data and shorter training, creating lightweight encoders from heavyweight ones.

Result: Lightweight encoders preserve reconstruction quality and statistical fidelity better than training lightweight encoders with original loss, evaluated across two different architectures.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables practical deployment of image compression models in resource-limited environments by reducing encoder complexity while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Deep learning models for image compression often face practical limitations in hardware-constrained applications. Although these models achieve high-quality reconstructions, they are typically complex, heavyweight, and require substantial training data and computational resources. We propose a methodology to partially compress these networks by reducing the size of their encoders. Our approach uses a simplified knowledge distillation strategy to approximate the latent space of the original models with less data and shorter training, yielding lightweight encoders from heavyweight ones. We evaluate the resulting lightweight encoders across two different architectures on the image compression task. Experiments show that our method preserves reconstruction quality and statistical fidelity better than training lightweight encoders with the original loss, making it practical for resource-limited environments.

TL;DR: SGDrive enhances autonomous driving planning by structuring Vision-Language Model representations into a hierarchical scene-agent-goal framework that mimics human driving cognition, achieving state-of-the-art performance on camera-only methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalist Vision-Language Models lack specialized understanding of driving-specific reasoning in 3D space and time, struggling to establish structured spatial-temporal representations needed for safe trajectory planning in complex driving scenarios.

Method: SGDrive structures VLM representation learning around a driving-specific knowledge hierarchy (scene-agent-goal) that mirrors human driving cognition, decomposing driving understanding into environmental perception, agent attention, and goal formulation before action execution.

Result: Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM benchmark show SGDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance among camera-only methods on both PDMS and EPDMS metrics, validating the effectiveness of hierarchical knowledge structuring.

Conclusion: Hierarchical knowledge structuring provides the structured spatial-temporal representation that generalist VLMs lack, enabling effective adaptation of VLMs to autonomous driving by integrating multi-level information into a compact yet comprehensive format for trajectory planning.

Abstract: Recent end-to-end autonomous driving approaches have leveraged Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enhance planning capabilities in complex driving scenarios. However, VLMs are inherently trained as generalist models, lacking specialized understanding of driving-specific reasoning in 3D space and time. When applied to autonomous driving, these models struggle to establish structured spatial-temporal representations that capture geometric relationships, scene context, and motion patterns critical for safe trajectory planning. To address these limitations, we propose SGDrive, a novel framework that explicitly structures the VLM's representation learning around driving-specific knowledge hierarchies. Built upon a pre-trained VLM backbone, SGDrive decomposes driving understanding into a scene-agent-goal hierarchy that mirrors human driving cognition: drivers first perceive the overall environment (scene context), then attend to safety-critical agents and their behaviors, and finally formulate short-term goals before executing actions. This hierarchical decomposition provides the structured spatial-temporal representation that generalist VLMs lack, integrating multi-level information into a compact yet comprehensive format for trajectory planning. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM benchmark demonstrate that SGDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance among camera-only methods on both PDMS and EPDMS, validating the effectiveness of hierarchical knowledge structuring for adapting generalist VLMs to autonomous driving.

TL;DR: SketchVL is a multimodal LLM that uses drawing-based intermediate reasoning and FinePO RL algorithm for fine-grained credit assignment, achieving 7.23% performance gains over base models on chart understanding and other reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chart understanding requires precise visual reasoning that challenges current MLLMs. Existing RL-trained MLLMs suffer from coarse credit assignment at trajectory level, unable to distinguish correct vs incorrect reasoning steps within responses.

Method: SketchVL draws intermediate reasoning steps as markers on images and feeds annotated images back to itself for multi-step reasoning. Uses FinePO RL algorithm with Fine-grained Process Reward Model (FinePRM) to score each drawing action, enabling step-level credit assignment.

Result: Achieves average 7.23% performance gain over base model across chart datasets, natural image datasets, and mathematics. Learns to align step-level behavior with FinePRM, demonstrating improved reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: SketchVL with FinePO provides promising direction for training powerful reasoning models through fine-grained credit assignment and drawing-based intermediate reasoning, addressing limitations of trajectory-level RL in MLLMs.

Abstract: Charts are high-density visual carriers of complex data and medium for information extraction and analysis. Due to the need for precise and complex visual reasoning, automated chart understanding poses a significant challenge to existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Many MLLMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) face the challenge of credit assignment. Their advantage estimation, typically performed at the trajectory level, cannot distinguish between correct and incorrect reasoning steps within a single generated response. To address this limitation, we introduce SketchVL, a novel MLLM that optimized with FinePO, a new RL algorithm designed for fine-grained credit assignment within each trajectory. SketchVL's methodology involves drawing its intermediate reasoning steps as markers on the image and feeding the annotated image back to itself, creating a robust, multi-step reasoning process. During training, the FinePO algorithm leverages a Fine-grained Process Reward Model (FinePRM) to score each drawing action within a trajectory, thereby precisely assigning credit for each step. This mechanism allows FinePO to more strongly reward correct tokens when a trajectory is globally successful, and more heavily penalize incorrect tokens when the trajectory is globally suboptimal, thus achieving fine-grained reinforcement signals. Experiments show that SketchVL learns to align its step-level behavior with the FinePRM, achieving an average performance gain of 7.23\% over its base model across chart datasets, natural image datasets, and mathematics, providing a promising new direction for training powerful reasoning models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GRPO techniques work well for text-to-image and text-to-video generation but fail to provide consistent reward improvements when directly applied to image-to-video (I2V) models.

Method: TAGRPO uses videos generated from identical initial noise as superior guidance, applies novel GRPO loss to intermediate latents for direct alignment with high-reward trajectories, and introduces a memory bank for rollout videos to enhance diversity and reduce computation.

Result: TAGRPO achieves significant improvements over DanceGRPO in I2V generation despite its simplicity.

Conclusion: The proposed TAGRPO framework successfully addresses limitations of existing GRPO methods for I2V models through contrastive learning principles and efficient rollout management.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of integrating Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) into flow matching models, particularly for text-to-image and text-to-video generation. However, we find that directly applying these techniques to image-to-video (I2V) models often fails to yield consistent reward improvements. To address this limitation, we present TAGRPO, a robust post-training framework for I2V models inspired by contrastive learning. Our approach is grounded in the observation that rollout videos generated from identical initial noise provide superior guidance for optimization. Leveraging this insight, we propose a novel GRPO loss applied to intermediate latents, encouraging direct alignment with high-reward trajectories while maximizing distance from low-reward counterparts. Furthermore, we introduce a memory bank for rollout videos to enhance diversity and reduce computational overhead. Despite its simplicity, TAGRPO achieves significant improvements over DanceGRPO in I2V generation.

Motivation: To create a SLAM system that goes beyond basic RGB-D input by incorporating semantic features, enabling both improved tracking/mapping accuracy and new downstream applications like open-set segmentation.

Method: Unifies camera tracking with 3D Gaussian Splatting mapping, integrates dense feature rasterization into novel-view synthesis aligned with visual foundation models, enabling feature-enriched mapping beyond pre-defined class labels.

Result: Achieves real-time tracking with 9% lower pose error and 8% higher mapping accuracy than fixed-set SLAM baselines, provides semantic/language masking comparable to offline 3DGS models with state-of-the-art tracking, depth, and RGB rendering.

Conclusion: FeatureSLAM demonstrates that real-time feature-embedded SLAM not only enables new downstream applications but also improves underlying tracking/mapping performance, offering semantic understanding beyond traditional class-based approaches.

Abstract: We present a real-time tracking SLAM system that unifies efficient camera tracking with photorealistic feature-enriched mapping using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our main contribution is integrating dense feature rasterization into the novel-view synthesis, aligned with a visual foundation model. This yields strong semantics, going beyond basic RGB-D input, aiding both tracking and mapping accuracy. Unlike previous semantic SLAM approaches (which embed pre-defined class labels) FeatureSLAM enables entirely new downstream tasks via free-viewpoint, open-set segmentation. Across standard benchmarks, our method achieves real-time tracking, on par with state-of-the-art systems while improving tracking stability and map fidelity without prohibitive compute. Quantitatively, we obtain 9\% lower pose error and 8\% higher mapping accuracy compared to recent fixed-set SLAM baselines. Our results confirm that real-time feature-embedded SLAM, is not only valuable for enabling new downstream applications. It also improves the performance of the underlying tracking and mapping subsystems, providing semantic and language masking results that are on-par with offline 3DGS models, alongside state-of-the-art tracking, depth and RGB rendering.

Motivation: Current FIQA methods either use only final-layer representations or require multiple forward passes/backpropagation. Need efficient training-free approach that leverages intermediate ViT features.

Method: ViTNT-FIQA measures stability of patch embedding evolution across intermediate ViT blocks by computing Euclidean distances between L2-normalized patch embeddings from consecutive blocks and aggregating into image-level quality scores.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on eight benchmarks (LFW, AgeDB-30, CFP-FP, CALFW, Adience, CPLFW, XQLFW, IJB-C) while maintaining computational efficiency with only single forward pass.

Conclusion: ViTNT-FIQA provides effective training-free FIQA by exploiting patch embedding stability across ViT blocks, offering immediate applicability to any pre-trained ViT-based face recognition model without modifications.

Abstract: Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) is essential for reliable face recognition systems. Current approaches primarily exploit only final-layer representations, while training-free methods require multiple forward passes or backpropagation. We propose ViTNT-FIQA, a training-free approach that measures the stability of patch embedding evolution across intermediate Vision Transformer (ViT) blocks. We demonstrate that high-quality face images exhibit stable feature refinement trajectories across blocks, while degraded images show erratic transformations. Our method computes Euclidean distances between L2-normalized patch embeddings from consecutive transformer blocks and aggregates them into image-level quality scores. We empirically validate this correlation on a quality-labeled synthetic dataset with controlled degradation levels. Unlike existing training-free approaches, ViTNT-FIQA requires only a single forward pass without backpropagation or architectural modifications. Through extensive evaluation on eight benchmarks (LFW, AgeDB-30, CFP-FP, CALFW, Adience, CPLFW, XQLFW, IJB-C), we show that ViTNT-FIQA achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods while maintaining computational efficiency and immediate applicability to any pre-trained ViT-based face recognition model.

*Quanjiang Li,Zhiming Liu,Tianxiang Xu,Tingjin Luo,Chenping Hou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADRL is a multi-view multi-label learning method that handles missing features and incomplete labels through adaptive disentangled representation learning, feature completion, and prototype-based label modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-view multi-label learning suffers from feature absence and incomplete annotations due to data acquisition challenges and expensive supervision costs. Existing methods have limitations in feature recovery, representation disentanglement, and label semantics modeling.

Method: ADRL uses adaptive disentangled representation learning with: 1) robust view completion via feature-level affinity propagation across modalities, 2) stochastic masking for reconstruction, 3) category-level association dissemination for label prototypes, 4) mutual-information-based objective for representation consistency, 5) prototype-specific feature selection with label embeddings, and 6) pseudo-label space exploitation for discriminative view fusion.

Result: Extensive experiments on public datasets and real-world applications demonstrate superior performance of ADRL compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: ADRL effectively addresses the practical challenges of multi-view multi-label learning with missing features and incomplete labels through its comprehensive disentangled representation learning framework.

Abstract: Multi-view multi-label learning frequently suffers from simultaneous feature absence and incomplete annotations, due to challenges in data acquisition and cost-intensive supervision. To tackle the complex yet highly practical problem while overcoming the existing limitations of feature recovery, representation disentanglement, and label semantics modeling, we propose an Adaptive Disentangled Representation Learning method (ADRL). ADRL achieves robust view completion by propagating feature-level affinity across modalities with neighborhood awareness, and reinforces reconstruction effectiveness by leveraging a stochastic masking strategy. Through disseminating category-level association across label distributions, ADRL refines distribution parameters for capturing interdependent label prototypes. Besides, we formulate a mutual-information-based objective to promote consistency among shared representations and suppress information overlap between view-specific representation and other modalities. Theoretically, we derive the tractable bounds to train the dual-channel network. Moreover, ADRL performs prototype-specific feature selection by enabling independent interactions between label embeddings and view representations, accompanied by the generation of pseudo-labels for each category. The structural characteristics of the pseudo-label space are then exploited to guide a discriminative trade-off during view fusion. Finally, extensive experiments on public datasets and real-world applications demonstrate the superior performance of ADRL.

### [44] [Boosting Latent Diffusion Models via Disentangled Representation Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05823)
*John Page,Xuesong Niu,Kai Wu,Kun Gai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Send-VAE improves image generation by optimizing VAEs for semantic disentanglement rather than just high-level semantics, achieving state-of-the-art FID scores on ImageNet 256x256.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches use the same alignment targets for both VAEs and LDMs, overlooking their different representational needs. VAEs should excel in semantic disentanglement for attribute-level information encoding, while LDMs need high-level semantic concepts.

Method: Proposes Semantic disentangled VAE (Send-VAE) that aligns VAE latent space with semantic hierarchy of pre-trained Vision Foundation Models using a non-linear mapper network, bridging attribute-level disentanglement with high-level semantics.

Result: Send-VAE significantly speeds up training and achieves state-of-the-art FID of 1.21 and 1.75 (with/without classifier-free guidance) on ImageNet 256x256. Semantic disentanglement correlates with improved generation performance.

Conclusion: Optimizing VAEs for semantic disentanglement rather than just high-level semantics leads to better image generation performance, demonstrating the importance of tailored representation learning for different components in diffusion models.

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) generate high-quality images by operating in a compressed latent space, typically obtained through image tokenizers such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In pursuit of a generation-friendly VAE, recent studies have explored leveraging Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) as representation alignment targets for VAEs, mirroring the approach commonly adopted for LDMs. Although this yields certain performance gains, using the same alignment target for both VAEs and LDMs overlooks their fundamentally different representational requirements. We advocate that while LDMs benefit from latents retaining high-level semantic concepts, VAEs should excel in semantic disentanglement, enabling encoding of attribute-level information in a structured way. To address this, we propose the Semantic disentangled VAE (Send-VAE), explicitly optimized for disentangled representation learning through aligning its latent space with the semantic hierarchy of pre-trained VFMs. Our approach employs a non-linear mapper network to transform VAE latents, aligning them with VFMs to bridge the gap between attribute-level disentanglement and high-level semantics, facilitating effective guidance for VAE learning. We evaluate semantic disentanglement via linear probing on attribute prediction tasks, showing strong correlation with improved generation performance. Finally, using Send-VAE, we train flow-based transformers SiTs; experiments show Send-VAE significantly speeds up training and achieves a state-of-the-art FID of 1.21 and 1.75 with and without classifier-free guidance on ImageNet 256x256.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoSurDepth is a self-supervised surround-view depth estimation framework that leverages geometry consistency as the primary cue, using foundation models as pseudo geometry priors and introducing novel view synthesis with adaptive joint motion learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior surround-view depth estimation approaches focus mainly on photometric constraints, but few explicitly exploit the rich geometric structure inherent in both monocular and surround-view settings. The authors aim to leverage geometry consistency as the primary cue for more robust depth estimation.

Method: 1) Uses foundation models as pseudo geometry priors to guide surface normal consistency in 3D space and regularize object/texture-consistent depth in 2D. 2) Introduces novel view synthesis pipeline with 2D-3D lifting via dense depth reconstruction through spatial warping. 3) Proposes adaptive joint motion learning strategy to emphasize informative spatial geometry cues for improved motion reasoning.

Result: Extensive experiments on DDAD and nuScenes datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of the geometry-focused approach for surround-view depth estimation.

Conclusion: The framework highlights the importance of exploiting geometry coherence and consistency for robust self-supervised multi-view depth estimation, providing a competitive alternative to laser-based sensors for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Accurate surround-view depth estimation provides a competitive alternative to laser-based sensors and is essential for 3D scene understanding in autonomous driving. While prior studies have proposed various approaches that primarily focus on enforcing cross-view constraints at the photometric level, few explicitly exploit the rich geometric structure inherent in both monocular and surround-view setting. In this work, we propose GeoSurDepth, a framework that leverages geometry consistency as the primary cue for surround-view depth estimation. Concretely, we utilize foundation models as a pseudo geometry prior and feature representation enhancement tool to guide the network to maintain surface normal consistency in spatial 3D space and regularize object- and texture-consistent depth estimation in 2D. In addition, we introduce a novel view synthesis pipeline where 2D-3D lifting is achieved with dense depth reconstructed via spatial warping, encouraging additional photometric supervision across temporal, spatial, and spatial-temporal contexts, and compensating for the limitations of single-view image reconstruction. Finally, a newly-proposed adaptive joint motion learning strategy enables the network to adaptively emphasize informative spatial geometry cues for improved motion reasoning. Extensive experiments on DDAD and nuScenes demonstrate that GeoSurDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. Our framework highlights the importance of exploiting geometry coherence and consistency for robust self-supervised multi-view depth estimation.

*Yinghan Xu,John Dingliana*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework decomposes arbitrarily posed humans into animatable multi-layered 3D avatars (body + garments) using 2D Gaussians for geometry/rendering and diffusion inpainting for occluded regions, achieving state-of-the-art quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-layer methods lock clothing to specific identities, while prior multi-layer approaches struggle with occluded regions, limiting realistic virtual try-on and high-fidelity 3D human asset creation.

Method: Encodes each layer as 2D Gaussians for accurate geometry and photorealistic rendering, uses pretrained 2D diffusion model with score-distillation sampling (SDS) to inpaint hidden regions, and employs three-stage training: coarse canonical garment reconstruction, then multi-layer training for body and garment details.

Result: Achieves better rendering quality and layer decomposition/recomposition than previous state-of-the-art on 4D-Dress and Thuman2.0 datasets, enabling realistic virtual try-on under novel viewpoints and poses.

Conclusion: The approach advances practical creation of high-fidelity 3D human assets for immersive applications by overcoming limitations of both single-layer and prior multi-layer reconstruction methods.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for decomposing arbitrarily posed humans into animatable multi-layered 3D human avatars, separating the body and garments. Conventional single-layer reconstruction methods lock clothing to one identity, while prior multi-layer approaches struggle with occluded regions. We overcome both limitations by encoding each layer as a set of 2D Gaussians for accurate geometry and photorealistic rendering, and inpainting hidden regions with a pretrained 2D diffusion model via score-distillation sampling (SDS). Our three-stage training strategy first reconstructs the coarse canonical garment via single-layer reconstruction, followed by multi-layer training to jointly recover the inner-layer body and outer-layer garment details. Experiments on two 3D human benchmark datasets (4D-Dress, Thuman2.0) show that our approach achieves better rendering quality and layer decomposition and recomposition than the previous state-of-the-art, enabling realistic virtual try-on under novel viewpoints and poses, and advancing practical creation of high-fidelity 3D human assets for immersive applications.

Abstract: Background: Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive cancers, with poor survival rates. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is a key diagnostic modality, but its effectiveness is constrained by operator subjectivity. This study evaluates a Vision Transformer-based deep learning segmentation model for pancreatic tumors. Methods: A segmentation model using the USFM framework with a Vision Transformer backbone was trained and validated with 17,367 EUS images (from two public datasets) in 5-fold cross-validation. The model was tested on an independent dataset of 350 EUS images from another public dataset, manually segmented by radiologists. Preprocessing included grayscale conversion, cropping, and resizing to 512x512 pixels. Metrics included Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), intersection over union (IoU), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Results: In 5-fold cross-validation, the model achieved a mean DSC of 0.651 +/- 0.738, IoU of 0.579 +/- 0.658, sensitivity of 69.8%, specificity of 98.8%, and accuracy of 97.5%. For the external validation set, the model achieved a DSC of 0.657 (95% CI: 0.634-0.769), IoU of 0.614 (95% CI: 0.590-0.689), sensitivity of 71.8%, and specificity of 97.7%. Results were consistent, but 9.7% of cases exhibited erroneous multiple predictions. Conclusions: The Vision Transformer-based model demonstrated strong performance for pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS images. However, dataset heterogeneity and limited external validation highlight the need for further refinement, standardization, and prospective studies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoAR is the first large-scale visual autoregressive framework for video generation that combines multi-scale next-frame prediction with autoregressive modeling, achieving state-of-the-art results while being 10x faster than diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: VideoAR narrows the performance gap between autoregressive and diffusion paradigms, offering a scalable, efficient, and temporally consistent foundation for future video generation research.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have been dominated by diffusion and flow-matching models, which produce high-quality results but remain computationally intensive and difficult to scale. In this work, we introduce VideoAR, the first large-scale Visual Autoregressive (VAR) framework for video generation that combines multi-scale next-frame prediction with autoregressive modeling. VideoAR disentangles spatial and temporal dependencies by integrating intra-frame VAR modeling with causal next-frame prediction, supported by a 3D multi-scale tokenizer that efficiently encodes spatio-temporal dynamics. To improve long-term consistency, we propose Multi-scale Temporal RoPE, Cross-Frame Error Correction, and Random Frame Mask, which collectively mitigate error propagation and stabilize temporal coherence. Our multi-stage pretraining pipeline progressively aligns spatial and temporal learning across increasing resolutions and durations. Empirically, VideoAR achieves new state-of-the-art results among autoregressive models, improving FVD on UCF-101 from 99.5 to 88.6 while reducing inference steps by over 10x, and reaching a VBench score of 81.74-competitive with diffusion-based models an order of magnitude larger. These results demonstrate that VideoAR narrows the performance gap between autoregressive and diffusion paradigms, offering a scalable, efficient, and temporally consistent foundation for future video generation research.

*Kaiwen Huang,Yizhe Zhang,Yi Zhou,Tianyang Xu,Tao Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BCSI framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation uses semantic-spatial perturbation, channel-selective routing, and bidirectional interaction to improve performance with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semi-supervised methods (mean teacher, dual-stream consistency) suffer from error accumulation, model complexity, and lack of interaction between labeled/unlabeled data streams.

Method: 1) Semantic-Spatial Perturbation (SSP) with strong augmentations and pseudo-label consistency; 2) Channel-selective Router (CR) for noise-reduced feature exchange; 3) Bidirectional Channel-wise Interaction (BCI) for semantic enhancement.

Result: Outperforms existing semi-supervised approaches on multiple benchmarking 3D medical datasets.

Conclusion: The BCSI framework effectively addresses limitations of current methods by enabling selective, bidirectional interaction between labeled and unlabeled data with improved robustness.

Abstract: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation is an effective method for addressing scenarios with limited labeled data. Existing methods mainly rely on frameworks such as mean teacher and dual-stream consistency learning. These approaches often face issues like error accumulation and model structural complexity, while also neglecting the interaction between labeled and unlabeled data streams. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Bidirectional Channel-selective Semantic Interaction~(BCSI) framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. First, we propose a Semantic-Spatial Perturbation~(SSP) mechanism, which disturbs the data using two strong augmentation operations and leverages unsupervised learning with pseudo-labels from weak augmentations. Additionally, we employ consistency on the predictions from the two strong augmentations to further improve model stability and robustness. Second, to reduce noise during the interaction between labeled and unlabeled data, we propose a Channel-selective Router~(CR) component, which dynamically selects the most relevant channels for information exchange. This mechanism ensures that only highly relevant features are activated, minimizing unnecessary interference. Finally, the Bidirectional Channel-wise Interaction~(BCI) strategy is employed to supplement additional semantic information and enhance the representation of important channels. Experimental results on multiple benchmarking 3D medical datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing semi-supervised approaches.

TL;DR: Phase4DFD is a deepfake detection framework that explicitly models phase information in frequency domain representations using learnable attention mechanisms, outperforming state-of-the-art methods while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing deepfake detection methods focus on spatial domain or frequency magnitude representations, implicitly under-exploring phase information which contains crucial manipulation artifacts that are difficult to detect in spatial analysis alone.

Method: Proposes Phase4DFD framework that augments RGB input with FFT magnitude and LBP representations, and introduces an input-level phase-aware attention module that uses phase discontinuities to guide the model toward frequency patterns most indicative of manipulation before backbone feature extraction.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAKE and DFFD datasets demonstrate that Phase4DFD outperforms state-of-the-art spatial and frequency-based detectors while maintaining low computational overhead.

Conclusion: Explicit phase modeling provides complementary and non-redundant information beyond magnitude-only frequency representations, making phase-aware attention crucial for effective deepfake detection in frequency domain.

Abstract: Recent deepfake detection methods have increasingly explored frequency domain representations to reveal manipulation artifacts that are difficult to detect in the spatial domain. However, most existing approaches rely primarily on spectral magnitude, implicitly under exploring the role of phase information. In this work, we propose Phase4DFD, a phase aware frequency domain deepfake detection framework that explicitly models phase magnitude interactions via a learnable attention mechanism. Our approach augments standard RGB input with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) magnitude and local binary pattern (LBP) representations to expose subtle synthesis artifacts that remain indistinguishable under spatial analysis alone. Crucially, we introduce an input level phase aware attention module that uses phase discontinuities commonly introduced by synthetic generation to guide the model toward frequency patterns that are most indicative of manipulation before backbone feature extraction. The attended multi domain representation is processed by an efficient BNext M backbone, with optional channel spatial attention applied for semantic feature refinement. Extensive experiments on the CIFAKE and DFFD datasets demonstrate that our proposed model Phase4DFD outperforms state of the art spatial and frequency-based detectors while maintaining low computational overhead. Comprehensive ablation studies further confirm that explicit phase modeling provides complementary and non-redundant information beyond magnitude-only frequency representations.

TL;DR: A vision transformer method using parallel local and global processing with relay tokens to segment ultra-high-resolution images without losing detail or context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for ultra-high-resolution image segmentation either use sliding windows (losing global context) or downsampling (losing fine detail), creating a need for a solution that preserves both local details and global awareness.

Method: Process images in parallel at local scale (high resolution, small crops) and global scale (low resolution, large crops), then aggregate and propagate features between branches using a small set of learnable relay tokens that plug into standard transformer backbones like ViT and Swin.

Result: Achieves consistent gains on three ultra-high-resolution segmentation benchmarks (Archaeoscape, URUR, Gleason) and Cityscapes, with up to 15% relative mIoU improvement, while adding fewer than 2% parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed relay token method effectively enables multi-scale reasoning in vision transformers, simultaneously preserving local details and global context for superior ultra-high-resolution image segmentation.

Abstract: Current approaches for segmenting ultra high resolution images either slide a window, thereby discarding global context, or downsample and lose fine detail. We propose a simple yet effective method that brings explicit multi scale reasoning to vision transformers, simultaneously preserving local details and global awareness. Concretely, we process each image in parallel at a local scale (high resolution, small crops) and a global scale (low resolution, large crops), and aggregate and propagate features between the two branches with a small set of learnable relay tokens.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Context Embedding Injection (CEI), a training-free method that reduces hallucinations in large vision-language models by using the last input token's hidden state as a grounding signal during decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations (responses inconsistent with visual input) remain a critical limitation of LVLMs in open-ended tasks like image captioning and visual reasoning, requiring effective mitigation strategies.

Method: The authors first analyze layer-wise generation dynamics using Logit Lens, discovering a "commitment-depth gap" where truthful tokens accumulate probability earlier than hallucinatory ones. Based on this, they propose Context Embedding Injection (CEI), which injects the hidden state of the last input token (context embedding) as a grounding signal throughout decoding to maintain visual fidelity.

Result: CEI outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across three LVLMs on CHAIR, AMBER, and MMHal-Bench benchmarks (with max token length of 512), with its dynamic variant achieving the lowest overall hallucination rates.

Conclusion: The work advances hallucination mitigation in LVLMs by combining novel mechanistic insights about generation dynamics with a scalable, training-free intervention that effectively reduces hallucinations while maintaining visual fidelity.

Abstract: Hallucinations, generating responses inconsistent with the visual input, remain a critical limitation of large vision-language models (LVLMs), especially in open-ended tasks such as image captioning and visual reasoning. In this work, we probe the layer-wise generation dynamics that drive hallucinations and propose a training-free mitigation strategy. Employing the Logit Lens, we examine how LVLMs construct next-token distributions across decoder layers, uncovering a pronounced commitment-depth gap: truthful tokens accumulate probability mass on their final candidates earlier than hallucinatory ones. Drawing on this discovery, we introduce Context Embedding Injection (CEI), a lightweight method that harnesses the hidden state of the last input token-the context embedding-as a grounding signal to maintain visual fidelity throughout decoding and curb hallucinations. Evaluated on the CHAIR, AMBER, and MMHal-Bench benchmarks (with a maximum token length of 512), CEI outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across three LVLMs, with its dynamic variant yielding the lowest overall hallucination rates. By integrating novel mechanistic insights with a scalable intervention, this work advances the mitigation of hallucinations in LVLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaveRNet: A wavelet-guided frequency learning framework for robust multi-source domain-generalized retinal vessel segmentation that addresses domain shift from illumination/contrast variations while preserving fine vessel structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shift from non-uniform illumination and varying contrast degrades retinal vessel segmentation performance. Existing SAM-based methods overlook frequency-domain information and lose fine vessel details through direct upsampling, limiting generalization across domains.

Method: Three key components: 1) Spectral-guided Domain Modulator (SDM) using wavelet decomposition with learnable domain tokens to separate illumination-robust low-frequency structures from high-frequency boundaries; 2) Frequency-Adaptive Domain Fusion (FADF) for test-time domain selection via wavelet-based frequency similarity; 3) Hierarchical Mask-Prompt Refiner (HMPR) for coarse-to-fine refinement with long-range dependency modeling.

Result: Extensive experiments under Leave-One-Domain-Out protocol on four public retinal datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art generalization performance for domain-generalized retinal vessel segmentation.

Conclusion: WaveRNet effectively addresses domain shift challenges in retinal vessel segmentation by leveraging wavelet-based frequency learning, enabling robust generalization across diverse illumination and contrast conditions while preserving fine vessel structures.

Abstract: Domain-generalized retinal vessel segmentation is critical for automated ophthalmic diagnosis, yet faces significant challenges from domain shift induced by non-uniform illumination and varying contrast, compounded by the difficulty of preserving fine vessel structures. While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibits remarkable zero-shot capabilities, existing SAM-based methods rely on simple adapter fine-tuning while overlooking frequency-domain information that encodes domain-invariant features, resulting in degraded generalization under illumination and contrast variations. Furthermore, SAM's direct upsampling inevitably loses fine vessel details. To address these limitations, we propose WaveRNet, a wavelet-guided frequency learning framework for robust multi-source domain-generalized retinal vessel segmentation. Specifically, we devise a Spectral-guided Domain Modulator (SDM) that integrates wavelet decomposition with learnable domain tokens, enabling the separation of illumination-robust low-frequency structures from high-frequency vessel boundaries while facilitating domain-specific feature generation. Furthermore, we introduce a Frequency-Adaptive Domain Fusion (FADF) module that performs intelligent test-time domain selection through wavelet-based frequency similarity and soft-weighted fusion. Finally, we present a Hierarchical Mask-Prompt Refiner (HMPR) that overcomes SAM's upsampling limitation through coarse-to-fine refinement with long-range dependency modeling. Extensive experiments under the Leave-One-Domain-Out protocol on four public retinal datasets demonstrate that WaveRNet achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deformable multi-contrast image registration is challenging due to complex intensity relationships across different imaging contrasts. Conventional methods are slow, while learning-based approaches lack generalizability to unseen contrasts.

Method: Proposes AC-CAR with random convolution-based contrast augmentation, adaptive conditional feature modulator (ACFM) for contrast-invariant feature learning, and variance network for uncertainty estimation.

Result: Outperforms baseline methods in registration accuracy and shows superior generalization to unseen imaging contrasts.

Conclusion: AC-CAR enables fast, accurate, and generalizable multi-contrast image registration with uncertainty estimation, addressing limitations of both conventional and existing learning-based methods.

Abstract: Deformable multi-contrast image registration is a challenging yet crucial task due to the complex, non-linear intensity relationships across different imaging contrasts. Conventional registration methods typically rely on iterative optimization of the deformation field, which is time-consuming. Although recent learning-based approaches enable fast and accurate registration during inference, their generalizability remains limited to the specific contrasts observed during training. In this work, we propose an adaptive conditional contrast-agnostic deformable image registration framework (AC-CAR) based on a random convolution-based contrast augmentation scheme. AC-CAR can generalize to arbitrary imaging contrasts without observing them during training. To encourage contrast-invariant feature learning, we propose an adaptive conditional feature modulator (ACFM) that adaptively modulates the features and the contrast-invariant latent regularization to enforce the consistency of the learned feature across different imaging contrasts. Additionally, we enable our framework to provide contrast-agnostic registration uncertainty by integrating a variance network that leverages the contrast-agnostic registration encoder to improve the trustworthiness and reliability of AC-CAR. Experimental results demonstrate that AC-CAR outperforms baseline methods in registration accuracy and exhibits superior generalization to unseen imaging contrasts.

*Adrian Serrano,Erwan Umlil,Ronan Thomas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deepfake detectors show varying adversarial robustness: adversarial training helps in-distribution but can hurt cross-dataset performance, requiring case-aware defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world deepfake detection systems face adversarial attacks with limited attacker knowledge and data distribution mismatches, but current adversarial training effectiveness under these realistic conditions is underexplored.

Method: Extended DUMB/DUMBer methodology to deepfake detection, evaluating 5 detectors (RECCE, SRM, XCeption, UCF, SPSL) against 3 attacks (PGD, FGSM, FPBA) on 2 datasets (FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF-V2) under transferability and cross-dataset constraints.

Result: Adversarial training reinforces robustness for in-distribution cases but can degrade performance in cross-dataset scenarios depending on the strategy, highlighting trade-offs between different mismatch conditions.

Conclusion: Real-world deepfake detection requires case-aware defense strategies rather than one-size-fits-all adversarial training, as effectiveness varies significantly between in-distribution and cross-dataset scenarios.

Abstract: Deepfake detection systems deployed in real-world environments are subject to adversaries capable of crafting imperceptible perturbations that degrade model performance. While adversarial training is a widely adopted defense, its effectiveness under realistic conditions -- where attackers operate with limited knowledge and mismatched data distributions - remains underexplored. In this work, we extend the DUMB -- Dataset soUrces, Model architecture and Balance - and DUMBer methodology to deepfake detection. We evaluate detectors robustness against adversarial attacks under transferability constraints and cross-dataset configuration to extract real-world insights. Our study spans five state-of-the-art detectors (RECCE, SRM, XCeption, UCF, SPSL), three attacks (PGD, FGSM, FPBA), and two datasets (FaceForensics++ and Celeb-DF-V2). We analyze both attacker and defender perspectives mapping results to mismatch scenarios. Experiments show that adversarial training strategies reinforce robustness in the in-distribution cases but can also degrade it under cross-dataset configuration depending on the strategy adopted. These findings highlight the need for case-aware defense strategies in real-world applications exposed to adversarial attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating experimental protocol design and execution is a fundamental bottleneck in realizing self-driving laboratories, requiring solutions to bridge language-based protocol generation with robotic execution.

Method: Uses language-model agents to gather procedures from web sources, convert them to structured experimental steps through planning-critique-validation loops, translate to Argonne MADSci format, and validate in NVIDIA Omniverse digital-twin environment before robotic execution.

Result: Demonstrated as a practical end-to-end workflow using Luna qPCR amplification and Cell Painting case studies, with protocols validated in digital-twin environment before automated execution on robotic instruments.

Conclusion: PRISM successfully bridges language-based protocol generation, simulation-based validation, and automated robotic execution, representing a significant step toward self-driving laboratories.

Abstract: Automating experimental protocol design and execution remains as a fundamental bottleneck in realizing self-driving laboratories. We introduce PRISM (Protocol Refinement through Intelligent Simulation Modeling), a framework that automates the design, validation, and execution of experimental protocols on a laboratory platform composed of off-the-shelf robotic instruments. PRISM uses a set of language-model-based agents that work together to generate and refine experimental steps. The process begins with automatically gathering relevant procedures from web-based sources describing experimental workflows. These are converted into structured experimental steps (e.g., liquid handling steps, deck layout and other related operations) through a planning, critique, and validation loop. The finalized steps are translated into the Argonne MADSci protocol format, which provides a unified interface for coordinating multiple robotic instruments (Opentrons OT-2 liquid handler, PF400 arm, Azenta plate sealer and peeler) without requiring human intervention between steps. To evaluate protocol-generation performance, we benchmarked both single reasoning models and multi-agent workflow across constrained and open-ended prompting paradigms. The resulting protocols were validated in a digital-twin environment built in NVIDIA Omniverse to detect physical or sequencing errors before execution. Using Luna qPCR amplification and Cell Painting as case studies, we demonstrate PRISM as a practical end-to-end workflow that bridges language-based protocol generation, simulation-based validation, and automated robotic execution.

TL;DR: Task-oriented shape completion for dexterous grasping using foundation models and flow-matching, outperforming SOTA by 16-55% on grasping and shape metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional shape completion fails for grasping under severe partial observation where missing data invalidates generic completion. Need task-oriented completion focused on contact regions rather than entire shape.

Method: 1) Generate multiple task-oriented shape completion candidates using zero-shot capabilities of pre-trained foundation models; 2) Use 3D discriminative autoencoder to evaluate plausibility and optimize best candidate; 3) Develop FlowGrasp conditional flow-matching model to generate dexterous grasps from optimized shape.

Result: Achieves SOTA in task-oriented dexterous grasping and shape completion: improves Grasp Displacement by 16.17% and Chamfer Distance by 55.26% over SOTA. Shows good capabilities with severe missing data and generality for open-set categories/tasks.

Conclusion: Task-oriented shape completion guided by manipulation tasks outperforms generic completion for dexterous grasping, especially under severe partial observation. Foundation models enable zero-shot functional understanding for contact region completion.

Abstract: Task-oriented dexterous grasping remains challenging in robotic manipulations of open-world objects under severe partial observation, where significant missing data invalidates generic shape completion. In this paper, to overcome this limitation, we study Task-Oriented Shape Completion, a new task that focuses on completing the potential contact regions rather than the entire shape. We argue that shape completion for grasping should be explicitly guided by the downstream manipulation task. To achieve this, we first generate multiple task-oriented shape completion candidates by leveraging the zero-shot capabilities of object functional understanding from several pre-trained foundation models. A 3D discriminative autoencoder is then proposed to evaluate the plausibility of each generated candidate and optimize the most plausible one from a global perspective. A conditional flow-matching model named FlowGrasp is developed to generate task-oriented dexterous grasps from the optimized shape. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in task-oriented dexterous grasping and task-oriented shape completion, improving the Grasp Displacement and the Chamfer Distance over the state-of-the-art by 16.17\% and 55.26%, respectively. In particular, it shows good capabilities in grasping objects with severe missing data. It also demonstrates good generality in handling open-set categories and tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robots to autonomously execute complex tasks in dynamic environments by learning from demonstrations while ensuring safety, balancing user preferences with robot costs, and handling environmental changes.

Method: Model latent tasks as probabilistic formal languages (PDFA), adapt evidence-driven state merging algorithms with safety constraints, and develop multi-objective reactive synthesis framework using two-player game modeling and value iteration for Pareto-optimal strategies.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show learned PDFAs never include unsafe behaviors, synthesized strategies consistently achieve tasks while meeting both robot cost and user-preference requirements across various robots and tasks.

Conclusion: The approach successfully enables safe, preference-aware robot task execution in dynamic environments through probabilistic formal language modeling and multi-objective reactive synthesis, with demonstrated effectiveness across diverse robotic applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to learning from demonstration that enables robots to autonomously execute complex tasks in dynamic environments. We model latent tasks as probabilistic formal languages and introduce a tailored reactive synthesis framework that balances robot costs with user task preferences. Our methodology focuses on safety-constrained learning and inferring formal task specifications as Probabilistic Deterministic Finite Automata (PDFA). We adapt existing evidence-driven state merging algorithms and incorporate safety requirements throughout the learning process to ensure that the learned PDFA always complies with safety constraints. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-objective reactive synthesis algorithm that generates deterministic strategies that are guaranteed to satisfy the PDFA task while optimizing the trade-offs between user preferences and robot costs, resulting in a Pareto front of optimal solutions. Our approach models the interaction as a two-player game between the robot and the environment, accounting for dynamic changes. We present a computationally-tractable value iteration algorithm to generate the Pareto front and the corresponding deterministic strategies. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms across various robots and tasks, showing that the learned PDFA never includes unsafe behaviors and that synthesized strategies consistently achieve the task while meeting both the robot cost and user-preference requirements.

TL;DR: EvoQRE is a traffic simulation framework that models human driver bounded rationality using Quantal Response Equilibrium and evolutionary game dynamics, achieving state-of-the-art realism and safety in traffic interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing traffic simulation frameworks assume perfectly rational agents, but human drivers exhibit bounded rationality with cognitive and perceptual constraints. There's a need for models that capture stochastic human behavior while maintaining equilibrium structure for safety-critical traffic interactions.

Method: Proposes EvoQRE framework that models traffic interactions as general-sum Markov games solved via Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE) and evolutionary game dynamics. Integrates pre-trained generative world model with entropy-regularized replicator dynamics, extends QRE to continuous action spaces using mixture-based and energy-based policy representations.

Result: Theoretical proof that dynamics converge to Logit-QRE with O(log k / k^{1/3}) convergence rate under weak monotonicity. Experiments on Waymo Open Motion Dataset and nuPlan benchmark show state-of-the-art realism, improved safety metrics, and controllable generation of diverse safety-critical scenarios through interpretable rationality parameters.

Conclusion: EvoQRE provides a principled framework for modeling bounded rationality in traffic interactions, offering theoretical guarantees, practical performance improvements, and interpretable control over scenario generation for autonomous vehicle simulation.

Abstract: Existing traffic simulation frameworks for autonomous vehicles typically rely on imitation learning or game-theoretic approaches that solve for Nash or coarse correlated equilibria, implicitly assuming perfectly rational agents. However, human drivers exhibit bounded rationality, making approximately optimal decisions under cognitive and perceptual constraints. We propose EvoQRE, a principled framework for modeling safety-critical traffic interactions as general-sum Markov games solved via Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE) and evolutionary game dynamics. EvoQRE integrates a pre-trained generative world model with entropy-regularized replicator dynamics, capturing stochastic human behavior while maintaining equilibrium structure. We provide rigorous theoretical results, proving that the proposed dynamics converge to Logit-QRE under a two-timescale stochastic approximation with an explicit convergence rate of O(log k / k^{1/3}) under weak monotonicity assumptions. We further extend QRE to continuous action spaces using mixture-based and energy-based policy representations. Experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset and nuPlan benchmark demonstrate that EvoQRE achieves state-of-the-art realism, improved safety metrics, and controllable generation of diverse safety-critical scenarios through interpretable rationality parameters.

TL;DR: Robotic system for autonomous ultrasound scanning of prostate phantoms with motion compensation, enabling consistent 3D reconstruction for biopsy planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prostate cancer diagnosis via biopsy is operator-dependent and requires high expertise. The goal is to develop an assisted robotic system for ultrasound examination to reduce dexterity requirements and enable faster, more accurate, and more available prostate biopsy.

Method: Developed a laboratory setup with a collaborative robotic arm that autonomously scans a prostate phantom attached to a medical robotic arm mimicking patient movements. The scanning robot maintains constant relative position between US probe and prostate. Each ultrasound slice is segmented to generate prostate contours, converted into a 3D point cloud for biopsy planning.

Result: Average scan time: 30s, average 3D reconstruction: 3s. Four motion scenarios tested (stationary, horizontal, vertical, combined). ICP registration showed mean 79.4-84.1% fitness and 0.35-0.37mm RMSE when comparing motion scenarios to stationary state. Maximum robot tracking error: 3mm, maximum motion compensation delay: 0.5s.

Conclusion: The robotic system successfully maintains consistent prostate reconstruction during patient motion with acceptable accuracy for biopsy planning. The 3mm tracking error is within medical literature requirements for prostate biopsy, demonstrating feasibility of robotic-assisted ultrasound for prebiopsy prostate examination.

Abstract: Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in men. Its diagnosis by biopsy requires a high level of expertise and precision from the surgeon, so the results are highly operator-dependent. The aim of this work is to develop a robotic system for assisted ultrasound (US) examination of the prostate, a prebiopsy step that could reduce the dexterity requirements and enable faster, more accurate and more available prostate biopsy. We developed and validated a laboratory setup with a collaborative robotic arm that can autonomously scan a prostate phantom and attached the phantom to a medical robotic arm that mimics the patient's movements. The scanning robot keeps the relative position of the US probe and the prostate constant, ensuring a consistent and robust approach to reconstructing the prostate. To reconstruct the prostate, each slice is segmented to generate a series of prostate contours converted into a 3D point cloud used for biopsy planning. The average scan time of the prostate was 30 s, and the average 3D reconstruction of the prostate took 3 s. We performed four motion scenarios: the phantom was scanned in a stationary state (S), with horizontal motion (H), with vertical motion (V), and with a combination of the two (C). System validation is performed by registering the prostate point cloud reconstructions acquired during different motions (H, V, C) with those obtained in the stationary state. ICP registration with a threshold of 0.8 mm yields mean 83.2\% fitness and 0.35 mm RMSE for S-H registration, 84.1\% fitness and 0.37 mm RMSE for S-V registration and 79.4\% fitness and 0.37 mm RMSE for S-C registration. Due to the elastic and soft material properties of the prostate phantom, the maximum robot tracking error was 3 mm, which can be sufficient for prostate biopsy according to medical literature. The maximum delay in motion compensation was 0.5 s.

Method: Modern SLAM framework adapted for 3D sonar data using INS as prior, with loop closure detection and pose graph optimization for drift correction.

Result: Average trajectory error <21cm over 50-minute missions, producing 10m×20m maps with 9cm average reconstruction error, validated in test tank and outdoor flooded quarry.

Conclusion: InsSo3D enables safe inspection of underwater structures in murky water by efficiently correcting odometry drift using 3D sonar and INS integration.

Abstract: This paper presents InsSo3D, an accurate and efficient method for large-scale 3D Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) using a 3D Sonar and an Inertial Navigation System (INS). Unlike traditional sonar, which produces 2D images containing range and azimuth information but lacks elevation information, 3D Sonar produces a 3D point cloud, which therefore does not suffer from elevation ambiguity. We introduce a robust and modern SLAM framework adapted to the 3D Sonar data using INS as prior, detecting loop closure and performing pose graph optimisation. We evaluated InsSo3D performance inside a test tank with access to ground truth data and in an outdoor flooded quarry. Comparisons to reference trajectories and maps obtained from an underwater motion tracking system and visual Structure From Motion (SFM) demonstrate that InsSo3D efficiently corrects odometry drift. The average trajectory error is below 21cm during a 50-minute-long mission, producing a map of 10m by 20m with a 9cm average reconstruction error, enabling safe inspection of natural or artificial underwater structures even in murky water conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data-driven approaches in additive manufacturing are limited by fragmented knowledge representations and unreliable extrapolation under sparse data conditions, creating a need for more structured and physically consistent modeling methods.

Method: Proposes an ontology-guided framework that integrates LLMs with an additive manufacturing mathematical knowledge graph (AM-MKG), encoding equations, variables, assumptions, and semantic relationships to transform unstructured literature into machine-interpretable representations, with LLM-based equation generation conditioned on MKG-derived subgraphs.

Result: Ontology-guided extraction significantly improves structural coherence and quantitative reliability of extracted knowledge, while subgraph-conditioned equation generation yields stable and physically consistent extrapolations compared to unguided LLM outputs.

Conclusion: The work establishes a unified pipeline for ontology-driven knowledge representation, equation-centered reasoning, and confidence-based extrapolation assessment, demonstrating the potential of knowledge-graph-augmented LLMs as reliable tools for extrapolative modeling in additive manufacturing.

Abstract: Additive manufacturing (AM) relies critically on understanding and extrapolating process-property relationships; however, existing data-driven approaches remain limited by fragmented knowledge representations and unreliable extrapolation under sparse data conditions. In this study, we propose an ontology-guided, equation-centric framework that tightly integrates large language models (LLMs) with an additive manufacturing mathematical knowledge graph (AM-MKG) to enable reliable knowledge extraction and principled extrapolative modeling. By explicitly encoding equations, variables, assumptions, and their semantic relationships within a formal ontology, unstructured literature is transformed into machine-interpretable representations that support structured querying and reasoning. LLM-based equation generation is further conditioned on MKG-derived subgraphs, enforcing physically meaningful functional forms and mitigating non-physical or unstable extrapolation trends. To assess reliability beyond conventional predictive uncertainty, a confidence-aware extrapolation assessment is introduced, integrating extrapolation distance, statistical stability, and knowledge-graph-based physical consistency into a unified confidence score. Results demonstrate that ontology-guided extraction significantly improves the structural coherence and quantitative reliability of extracted knowledge, while subgraph-conditioned equation generation yields stable and physically consistent extrapolations compared to unguided LLM outputs. Overall, this work establishes a unified pipeline for ontology-driven knowledge representation, equation-centered reasoning, and confidence-based extrapolation assessment, highlighting the potential of knowledge-graph-augmented LLMs as reliable tools for extrapolative modeling in additive manufacturing.

Motivation: While LLMs are increasingly used as autonomous agents in strategic interactions and personality traits are known to influence their behavior, it remains unclear how personality steering specifically affects cooperation under controlled conditions.

Method: Used repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games to examine personality steering effects. First measured basic personality profiles of GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o, and GPT-5 using Big Five Inventory, then compared baseline vs. personality-informed conditions, and manipulated each personality dimension to extreme values independently.

Result: Agreeableness was the dominant factor promoting cooperation across all models, while other personality traits had limited impact. Explicit personality information increased cooperation but also raised vulnerability to exploitation, particularly in earlier-generation models. Later-generation models exhibited more selective cooperation.

Conclusion: Personality steering acts as a behavioral bias rather than a deterministic control mechanism, with agreeableness being the key factor for cooperation, though newer models show more strategic, selective cooperation compared to earlier models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as autonomous agents in strategic and social interactions. Although recent studies suggest that assigning personality traits to LLMs can influence their behavior, how personality steering affects cooperation under controlled conditions remains unclear. In this study, we examine the effects of personality steering on cooperative behavior in LLM agents using repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games. Based on the Big Five framework, we first measure basic personality profiles of three models, GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o, and GPT-5, using the Big Five Inventory. We then compare behavior under baseline and personality-informed conditions, and further analyze the effects of independently manipulating each personality dimension to extreme values. Our results show that agreeableness is the dominant factor promoting cooperation across all models, while other personality traits have limited impact. Explicit personality information increases cooperation but can also raise vulnerability to exploitation, particularly in earlier-generation models. In contrast, later-generation models exhibit more selective cooperation. These findings indicate that personality steering acts as a behavioral bias rather than a deterministic control mechanism.

### [70] [Improving Enzyme Prediction with Chemical Reaction Equations by Hypergraph-Enhanced Knowledge Graph Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05330)
*Tengwei Song,Long Yin,Zhen Han,Zhiqiang Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hyper-Enz: Knowledge-enhanced hypergraph model using KGE and hypergraph transformers to predict enzyme-substrate interactions from chemical reaction equations, achieving 88% improvement in enzyme retrieval accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing enzyme-substrate prediction methods rely on sparse, labor-intensive expert-curated databases, limiting generalization to unseen interactions. Chemical reaction equations offer denser, more abundant data but involve complex multi-compound relationships that traditional models can't capture.

Method: Represent chemical reactions as (educt, enzyme, product) triples in a knowledge graph, then use knowledge graph embedding (KGE) with a hypergraph transformer (Hyper-Enz) to learn representations of hyper-edges involving multiple compounds. Introduce multi-expert paradigm to guide learning from both model and reaction equations.

Result: Significant improvements: up to 88% relative improvement in average enzyme retrieval accuracy and 30% improvement in pair-level prediction compared to traditional models.

Conclusion: Hyper-Enz effectively addresses enzyme-substrate prediction by leveraging knowledge graph embeddings and hypergraph transformers to capture complex multi-compound relationships from chemical reaction equations, outperforming traditional approaches.

Abstract: Predicting enzyme-substrate interactions has long been a fundamental problem in biochemistry and metabolic engineering. While existing methods could leverage databases of expert-curated enzyme-substrate pairs for models to learn from known pair interactions, the databases are often sparse, i.e., there are only limited and incomplete examples of such pairs, and also labor-intensive to maintain. This lack of sufficient training data significantly hinders the ability of traditional enzyme prediction models to generalize to unseen interactions. In this work, we try to exploit chemical reaction equations from domain-specific databases, given their easier accessibility and denser, more abundant data. However, interactions of multiple compounds, e.g., educts and products, with the same enzymes create complex relational data patterns that traditional models cannot easily capture. To tackle that, we represent chemical reaction equations as triples of (educt, enzyme, product) within a knowledge graph, such that we can take advantage of knowledge graph embedding (KGE) to infer missing enzyme-substrate pairs for graph completion. Particularly, in order to capture intricate relationships among compounds, we propose our knowledge-enhanced hypergraph model for enzyme prediction, i.e., Hyper-Enz, which integrates a hypergraph transformer with a KGE model to learn representations of the hyper-edges that involve multiple educts and products. Also, a multi-expert paradigm is introduced to guide the learning of enzyme-substrate interactions with both the proposed model and chemical reaction equations. Experimental results show a significant improvement, with up to a 88% relative improvement in average enzyme retrieval accuracy and 30% improvement in pair-level prediction compared to traditional models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Persona conditioning in LLMs shows non-monotonic effects on clinical decision-making: medical personas improve critical care performance but degrade primary care performance, with interaction styles affecting risk propensity in model-dependent ways.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate how persona-based control (professional roles and interaction styles) affects LLM behavior in high-stakes clinical decision-making, challenging the assumption that personas monotonically improve expertise and safety.

Method: Systematically evaluate persona-based control in clinical LLMs by examining professional roles (Emergency Department physician, nurse) and interaction styles (bold vs. cautious), assessing performance on clinical triage and patient-safety tasks using multidimensional evaluations of accuracy, calibration, and safety-relevant risk behavior.

Result: Medical personas improve performance in critical care tasks (+20% accuracy/calibration) but degrade performance in primary-care settings by comparable margins. Interaction style modulates risk propensity but is model-dependent. Human clinicians show moderate safety compliance agreement (κ=0.43) but low confidence (95.9%) in reasoning quality.

Conclusion: Personas function as behavioral priors that introduce context-dependent trade-offs rather than guarantees of safety or expertise, revealing a "persona paradox" where medical personas can both help and harm depending on clinical context.

Abstract: Persona conditioning can be viewed as a behavioral prior for large language models (LLMs) and is often assumed to confer expertise and improve safety in a monotonic manner. However, its effects on high-stakes clinical decision-making remain poorly characterized. We systematically evaluate persona-based control in clinical LLMs, examining how professional roles (e.g., Emergency Department physician, nurse) and interaction styles (bold vs.\ cautious) influence behavior across models and medical tasks. We assess performance on clinical triage and patient-safety tasks using multidimensional evaluations that capture task accuracy, calibration, and safety-relevant risk behavior. We find systematic, context-dependent, and non-monotonic effects: Medical personas improve performance in critical care tasks, yielding gains of up to $\sim+20\%$ in accuracy and calibration, but degrade performance in primary-care settings by comparable margins. Interaction style modulates risk propensity and sensitivity, but it's highly model-dependent. While aggregated LLM-judge rankings favor medical over non-medical personas in safety-critical cases, we found that human clinicians show moderate agreement on safety compliance (average Cohen's $κ= 0.43$) but indicate a low confidence in 95.9\% of their responses on reasoning quality. Our work shows that personas function as behavioral priors that introduce context-dependent trade-offs rather than guarantees of safety or expertise.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI agents exhibit systematic conformity bias in multi-agent environments, making them vulnerable to social manipulation despite strong individual performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI agents increasingly operate in multi-agent environments, understanding their collective behavior is critical for predicting artificial society dynamics and identifying security vulnerabilities.

Method: Adapted classic visual experiments from social psychology to investigate how AI agents respond to group influence, testing sensitivity to group size, unanimity, task difficulty, and source characteristics.

Result: AI agents show systematic conformity bias aligned with Social Impact Theory; agents with near-perfect individual performance become highly susceptible to social manipulation; vulnerability persists across model scales, with larger models showing reduced conformity on simple tasks but remaining vulnerable at competence boundaries.

Conclusion: AI agents have fundamental security vulnerabilities in decision-making that could enable malicious manipulation, misinformation campaigns, and bias propagation, highlighting urgent need for safeguards in collective AI deployments.

Abstract: As AI agents increasingly operate in multi-agent environments, understanding their collective behavior becomes critical for predicting the dynamics of artificial societies. This study examines conformity, the tendency to align with group opinions under social pressure, in large multimodal language models functioning as AI agents. By adapting classic visual experiments from social psychology, we investigate how AI agents respond to group influence as social actors. Our experiments reveal that AI agents exhibit a systematic conformity bias, aligned with Social Impact Theory, showing sensitivity to group size, unanimity, task difficulty, and source characteristics. Critically, AI agents achieving near-perfect performance in isolation become highly susceptible to manipulation through social influence. This vulnerability persists across model scales: while larger models show reduced conformity on simple tasks due to improved capabilities, they remain vulnerable when operating at their competence boundary. These findings reveal fundamental security vulnerabilities in AI agent decision-making that could enable malicious manipulation, misinformation campaigns, and bias propagation in multi-agent systems, highlighting the urgent need for safeguards in collective AI deployments.

TL;DR: Researchers develop algorithms to measure performance gains from limited cheating in chess using chess engines, aiming to quantify cheating effectiveness rather than assist cheaters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cheating in chess using software advice has become a serious problem at all levels. While most previous work focused on detection, this research aims to quantify the actual performance gains from cheating to better understand and combat it.

Method: Developed algorithms to evaluate performance gains from cheating a limited number of times during a game, tested on a commonly used chess engine.

Result: Not specified in the abstract, but the algorithms were developed and tested on chess engine software to measure cheating effectiveness.

Conclusion: The research provides tools to measure cheating effectiveness, which is crucial for containing and detecting cheating in chess, rather than assisting cheaters.

Abstract: Cheating in chess, by using advice from powerful software, has become a major problem, reaching the highest levels. As opposed to the large majority of previous work, which concerned {\em detection} of cheating, here we try to evaluate the possible gain in performance, obtained by cheating a limited number of times during a game. Algorithms are developed and tested on a commonly used chess engine (i.e software).\footnote{Needless to say, the goal of this work is not to assist cheaters, but to measure the effectiveness of cheating -- which is crucial as part of the effort to contain and detect it.}

*Jua Han,Jaeyoon Seo,Jungbin Min,Jean Oh,Jihie Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs are dangerously unreliable for safety-critical robotics applications, with even 99% accuracy being unacceptable as it means 1 in 100 executions could cause catastrophic harm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs become integral to robotics decision-making, the physical risks grow - a single wrong instruction can endanger human lives. There's an urgent need to systematically evaluate LLM performance in scenarios where minor errors are catastrophic.

Method: Qualitative evaluation of fire evacuation scenario identified critical failure cases. Designed seven quantitative tasks categorized into: Complete Information (ASCII maps to isolate spatial reasoning), Incomplete Information (inferring missing context), and Safety-Oriented Spatial Reasoning (natural language evaluation in life-threatening contexts). Benchmarked various LLMs and VLMs across these tasks.

Result: Serious vulnerabilities revealed: several models achieved 0% success rate in ASCII navigation. In simulated fire drills, models instructed robots to move toward hazardous areas instead of emergency exits. Analysis shows how "rare" 1% failure rates escalate into catastrophic outcomes.

Conclusion: Current LLMs are not ready for direct deployment in safety-critical systems. A 99% accuracy rate is dangerously misleading in robotics as it implies one out of every hundred executions could result in catastrophic harm. Even state-of-the-art models cannot guarantee safety, and absolute reliance on them creates unacceptable risks.

Abstract: One mistake by an AI system in a safety-critical setting can cost lives. As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to robotics decision-making, the physical dimension of risk grows; a single wrong instruction can directly endanger human safety. This paper addresses the urgent need to systematically evaluate LLM performance in scenarios where even minor errors are catastrophic. Through a qualitative evaluation of a fire evacuation scenario, we identified critical failure cases in LLM-based decision-making. Based on these, we designed seven tasks for quantitative assessment, categorized into: Complete Information, Incomplete Information, and Safety-Oriented Spatial Reasoning (SOSR). Complete information tasks utilize ASCII maps to minimize interpretation ambiguity and isolate spatial reasoning from visual processing. Incomplete information tasks require models to infer missing context, testing for spatial continuity versus hallucinations. SOSR tasks use natural language to evaluate safe decision-making in life-threatening contexts. We benchmark various LLMs and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) across these tasks. Beyond aggregate performance, we analyze the implications of a 1% failure rate, highlighting how "rare" errors escalate into catastrophic outcomes. Results reveal serious vulnerabilities: several models achieved a 0% success rate in ASCII navigation, while in a simulated fire drill, models instructed robots to move toward hazardous areas instead of emergency exits. Our findings lead to a sobering conclusion: current LLMs are not ready for direct deployment in safety-critical systems. A 99% accuracy rate is dangerously misleading in robotics, as it implies one out of every hundred executions could result in catastrophic harm. We demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models cannot guarantee safety, and absolute reliance on them creates unacceptable risks.

### [75] [ART: Adaptive Reasoning Trees for Explainable Claim Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05455)
*Sahil Wadhwa,Himanshu Kumar,Guanqun Yang,Abbaas Alif Mohamed Nishar,Pranab Mohanty,Swapnil Shinde,Yue Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ART (Adaptive Reasoning Trees) is a hierarchical method for explainable claim verification that uses tree-structured reasoning with supporting/attacking arguments, adjudicated by LLM judges, to produce transparent and contestable verdicts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have strong decision-making capabilities but lack transparency and contestability in high-stakes environments - their outputs lack faithful explanations and errors cannot be effectively corrected, undermining trustworthiness.

Method: ART uses hierarchical reasoning trees starting with a root claim that branches into supporting/attacking child arguments. Argument strength is determined bottom-up via pairwise tournaments of children adjudicated by judge LLMs, enabling systematic derivation of transparent, contestable verdicts.

Result: Empirical validation on multiple datasets shows ART's structured reasoning outperforms strong baselines, establishing a new benchmark for explainable claim verification that is more reliable and ensures clarity in decision-making.

Conclusion: ART provides a transparent, contestable framework for claim verification that addresses LLM opacity issues, offering systematic reasoning that outperforms existing methods like Chain-of-Thought while ensuring explainability and reliability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful candidates for complex decision-making, leveraging vast encoded knowledge and remarkable zero-shot abilities. However, their adoption in high-stakes environments is hindered by their opacity; their outputs lack faithful explanations and cannot be effectively contested to correct errors, undermining trustworthiness. In this paper, we propose ART (Adaptive Reasoning Trees), a hierarchical method for claim verification. The process begins with a root claim, which branches into supporting and attacking child arguments. An argument's strength is determined bottom-up via a pairwise tournament of its children, adjudicated by a judge LLM, allowing a final, transparent and contestable verdict to be systematically derived which is missing in methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). We empirically validate ART on multiple datasets, analyzing different argument generators and comparison strategies. Our findings show that ART's structured reasoning outperforms strong baselines, establishing a new benchmark for explainable claim verification which is more reliable and ensures clarity in the overall decision making step.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PRISMA is a decoupled RL framework with Plan-Retrieve-Inspect-Solve-Memoize architecture that addresses retrieval collapse and learning instability in multi-hop question answering through reasoning-guided collaboration and two-stage policy optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL-optimized RAG systems for open-domain multi-hop QA suffer from retrieval collapse (failure to find intermediate evidence without reasoning-guided planning) and learning instability (weak credit assignment and poor error localization across modules), limiting reliable deployment.

Method: PRISMA uses a decoupled Plan-Retrieve-Inspect-Solve-Memoize architecture with reasoning-guided collaboration. The Inspector provides feedback to refine Planner's decomposition and retrieval while enforcing evidence-grounded reasoning in Solver. Optimization uses Two-Stage Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO): Stage I calibrates Planner and Solver as specialized experts; Stage II uses Observation-Aware Residual Policy Optimization (OARPO) to enhance Inspector's verification and recovery capabilities.

Result: PRISMA achieves state-of-the-art performance on ten benchmarks and can be deployed efficiently in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: PRISMA's decoupled architecture with reasoning-guided collaboration and two-stage policy optimization effectively addresses retrieval collapse and learning instability in multi-hop QA, enabling reliable deployment of RL-optimized RAG systems.

Abstract: Answering real-world open-domain multi-hop questions over massive corpora is a critical challenge in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Recent research employs reinforcement learning (RL) to end-to-end optimize the retrieval-augmented reasoning process, directly enhancing its capacity to resolve complex queries. However, reliable deployment is hindered by two obstacles. 1) Retrieval Collapse: iterative retrieval over large corpora fails to locate intermediate evidence containing bridge answers without reasoning-guided planning, causing downstream reasoning to collapse. 2) Learning Instability: end-to-end trajectory training suffers from weak credit assignment across reasoning chains and poor error localization across modules, causing overfitting to benchmark-specific heuristics that limit transferability and stability. To address these problems, we propose PRISMA, a decoupled RL-guided framework featuring a Plan-Retrieve-Inspect-Solve-Memoize architecture. PRISMA's strength lies in reasoning-guided collaboration: the Inspector provides reasoning-based feedback to refine the Planner's decomposition and fine-grained retrieval, while enforcing evidence-grounded reasoning in the Solver. We optimize individual agent capabilities via Two-Stage Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Stage I calibrates the Planner and Solver as specialized experts in planning and reasoning, while Stage II utilizes Observation-Aware Residual Policy Optimization (OARPO) to enhance the Inspector's ability to verify context and trigger targeted recovery. Experiments show that PRISMA achieves state-of-the-art performance on ten benchmarks and can be deployed efficiently in real-world scenarios.

Motivation: Current remote sensing change detection approaches rely on rigid, single-modal analysis, limiting their ability to understand complex urban environment changes needed for sustainable development.

Method: Proposes MMUEChange framework with modular toolkit and core Modality Controller for cross- and intra-modal alignment, enabling flexible integration of heterogeneous urban data for analyzing complex change scenarios.

Result: Achieves 46.7% improvement in task success rate compared to best-performing baseline, effectively mitigates hallucination, and demonstrates capability through case studies of park changes in NYC, water pollution in Hong Kong, and waste management in Shenzhen.

Conclusion: MMUEChange demonstrates capacity to support complex urban change analysis with real-world policy implications, offering a robust framework for sustainable urban development through multi-modal data integration.

Abstract: Understanding urban environment change is essential for sustainable development. However, current approaches, particularly remote sensing change detection, often rely on rigid, single-modal analysis. To overcome these limitations, we propose MMUEChange, a multi-modal agent framework that flexibly integrates heterogeneous urban data via a modular toolkit and a core module, Modality Controller for cross- and intra-modal alignment, enabling robust analysis of complex urban change scenarios. Case studies include: a shift toward small, community-focused parks in New York, reflecting local green space efforts; the spread of concentrated water pollution across districts in Hong Kong, pointing to coordinated water management; and a notable decline in open dumpsites in Shenzhen, with contrasting links between nighttime economic activity and waste types, indicating differing urban pressures behind domestic and construction waste. Compared to the best-performing baseline, the MMUEChange agent achieves a 46.7% improvement in task success rate and effectively mitigates hallucination, demonstrating its capacity to support complex urban change analysis tasks with real-world policy implications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes probabilistic evaluation metrics (expected accuracy/F1) and stratified analysis by ground truth certainty to address misleading AI benchmarking when expert answers have uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI benchmarking ignores uncertainty in ground truth answers, which is particularly problematic in medicine where uncertainty is pervasive. This can lead to misleading conclusions where non-experts appear to perform similarly to experts.

Method: Introduces a probabilistic paradigm to explain how ground truth certainty affects evaluation scores. Develops expected accuracy and expected F1 metrics to estimate expert performance given answer variability. Recommends stratifying results by probability of ground truth answer (measured by expert agreement rate).

Result: Shows that high certainty in ground truth is necessary for experts to achieve high scores, while in datasets with high answer variation, there may be little difference between random labelers and experts. Stratified evaluation becomes critical when overall performance drops below 80%.

Conclusion: AI benchmarking should account for ground truth uncertainty through probabilistic metrics and stratified evaluation by certainty levels. This makes performance comparisons more reliable in high-certainty scenarios and mitigates the confounding effect of uncertainty.

Abstract: Benchmarking the relative capabilities of AI systems, including Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Models, typically ignores the impact of uncertainty in the underlying ground truth answers from experts. This ambiguity is particularly consequential in medicine where uncertainty is pervasive. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic paradigm to theoretically explain how high certainty in ground truth answers is almost always necessary for even an expert to achieve high scores, whereas in datasets with high variation in ground truth answers there may be little difference between a random labeller and an expert. Therefore, ignoring uncertainty in ground truth evaluation data can result in the misleading conclusion that a non-expert has similar performance to that of an expert. Using the probabilistic paradigm, we thus bring forth the concepts of expected accuracy and expected F1 to estimate the score an expert human or system can achieve given ground truth answer variability.
  Our work leads to the recommendation that when establishing the capability of a system, results should be stratified by probability of the ground truth answer, typically measured by the agreement rate of ground truth experts. Stratification becomes critical when the overall performance drops below a threshold of 80%. Under stratified evaluation, performance comparison becomes more reliable in high certainty bins, mitigating the effect of the key confounding factor -- uncertainty.

TL;DR: Crisis-Bench is a multi-agent POMDP framework that evaluates LLMs in corporate crisis simulations, revealing a tension between universal safety alignment and professional needs for strategic ambiguity in PR/negotiation contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard safety alignment creates a "Boy Scout" morality that imposes a "transparency tax" on professional domains requiring strategic ambiguity and information withholding (PR, negotiation, crisis management). There's a gap between general safety and professional utility that needs measurement.

Method: Introduced Crisis-Bench: a multi-agent POMDP evaluating LLMs in 80 diverse storylines across 8 industries. Features a PR Agent navigating 7-day corporate crisis simulations with separated Private/Public narrative states to enforce information asymmetry. Uses Adjudicator-Market Loop evaluation: public sentiment adjudicated and translated into simulated stock price for economic incentives.

Result: Exposed critical dichotomy: some models capitulate to ethical concerns, while others demonstrate capacity for Machiavellian, legitimate strategic withholding to stabilize simulated stock price. Provides first quantitative framework for assessing "Reputation Management" capabilities.

Conclusion: Argues for shift from rigid moral absolutism to context-aware professional alignment. Crisis-Bench enables measurement of professional utility beyond universal safety, highlighting need for domain-specific ethical frameworks in professional contexts.

Abstract: Standard safety alignment optimizes Large Language Models (LLMs) for universal helpfulness and honesty, effectively instilling a rigid "Boy Scout" morality. While robust for general-purpose assistants, this one-size-fits-all ethical framework imposes a "transparency tax" on professional domains requiring strategic ambiguity and information withholding, such as public relations, negotiation, and crisis management. To measure this gap between general safety and professional utility, we introduce Crisis-Bench, a multi-agent Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) that evaluates LLMs in high-stakes corporate crises. Spanning 80 diverse storylines across 8 industries, Crisis-Bench tasks an LLM-based Public Relations (PR) Agent with navigating a dynamic 7-day corporate crisis simulation while managing strictly separated Private and Public narrative states to enforce rigorous information asymmetry. Unlike traditional benchmarks that rely on static ground truths, we introduce the Adjudicator-Market Loop: a novel evaluation metric where public sentiment is adjudicated and translated into a simulated stock price, creating a realistic economic incentive structure. Our results expose a critical dichotomy: while some models capitulate to ethical concerns, others demonstrate the capacity for Machiavellian, legitimate strategic withholding in order to stabilize the simulated stock price. Crisis-Bench provides the first quantitative framework for assessing "Reputation Management" capabilities, arguing for a shift from rigid moral absolutism to context-aware professional alignment.

TL;DR: This paper proposes using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) to post-train lightweight language models for fraud detection on raw e-commerce transaction data, achieving significant F1-score improvements by discovering novel fraud indicators beyond traditional feature engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: E-commerce platforms face sophisticated fraud schemes, but LLMs' practical effectiveness for fraud detection remains unexplored and unvalidated in real-world financial contexts. There's a gap between conventional ML limitations and LLMs' untapped potential for detecting fraud in domain-specific transaction data.

Method: Uses Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) algorithm and rule-based reward system to post-train lightweight language models on raw transaction data. Models explore diverse trust/risk signals in textual transaction data including customer information, shipping details, product descriptions, and order history.

Result: Post-trained language models achieve substantial F1-score improvements on held-out test data. Performance improvements are primarily due to RL's exploration mechanism, which allows models to discover novel fraud indicators beyond those captured by traditional engineered features.

Conclusion: RL-based post-training of lightweight language models is effective for fraud detection, bridging the gap between conventional ML and LLMs' potential. The exploration mechanism in RL enables discovery of novel fraud patterns in raw transaction data without extensive feature engineering.

Abstract: E-commerce platforms and payment solution providers face increasingly sophisticated fraud schemes, ranging from identity theft and account takeovers to complex money laundering operations that exploit the speed and anonymity of digital transactions. However, despite their theoretical promise, the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to fraud detection in real-world financial contexts remains largely unexploited, and their practical effectiveness in handling domain-specific e-commerce transaction data has yet to be empirically validated. To bridge this gap between conventional machine learning limitations and the untapped potential of LLMs in fraud detection, this paper proposes a novel approach that employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) to post-train lightweight language models specifically for fraud detection tasks using only raw transaction data. We utilize the Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) algorithm combined with a rule-based reward system to fine-tune language models of various sizes on a real-life transaction dataset provided by a Chinese global payment solution company. Through this reinforcement learning framework, the language models are encouraged to explore diverse trust and risk signals embedded within the textual transaction data, including patterns in customer information, shipping details, product descriptions, and order history. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, with post-trained language models achieving substantial F1-score improvements on held-out test data. Our findings demonstrate that the observed performance improvements are primarily attributable to the exploration mechanism inherent in reinforcement learning, which allows models to discover novel fraud indicators beyond those captured by traditional engineered features.

### [83] [A Causal Information-Flow Framework for Unbiased Learning-to-Rank](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05590)
*Haoming Gong,Qingyao Ai,Zhihao Tao,Yongfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Novel causal learning framework for unbiased ranking that uses structural causal models and information theory to measure and reduce multiple biases (position, selection, trust) in click data, improving ranking performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Click data in search/ranking systems contains multiple biases (position, selection, trust) that prevent learning true relevance. Existing ULTR methods mainly correct position bias but cannot measure remaining bias, provide risk guarantees, or handle multiple bias sources jointly.

Method: Combines Structural Causal Models (SCMs) with information-theoretic tools. SCMs specify click generation and identify true relevance, while conditional mutual information measures bias leakage into learned relevance estimates. Uses this leakage as a regularizer during training and incorporates doubly robust estimator for reliable risk estimation.

Result: Experiments on standard Learning-to-Rank benchmarks show consistent reduction in measured bias leakage and improved ranking performance, especially in realistic scenarios where multiple biases (position and trust bias) interact strongly.

Conclusion: The proposed causal learning framework effectively addresses limitations of existing ULTR methods by providing a rigorous way to measure and reduce multiple biases simultaneously, leading to better ranking performance through principled bias disentanglement and reliable risk estimation.

Abstract: In web search and recommendation systems, user clicks are widely used to train ranking models. However, click data is heavily biased, i.e., users tend to click higher-ranked items (position bias), choose only what was shown to them (selection bias), and trust top results more (trust bias). Without explicitly modeling these biases, the true relevance of ranked items cannot be correctly learned from clicks. Existing Unbiased Learning-to-Rank (ULTR) methods mainly correct position bias and rely on propensity estimation, but they cannot measure remaining bias, provide risk guarantees, or jointly handle multiple bias sources. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel causal learning-based ranking framework that extends ULTR by combining Structural Causal Models (SCMs) with information-theoretic tools. SCMs specify how clicks are generated and help identify the true relevance signal from click data, while conditional mutual information, measures how much bias leaks into the
  learned relevance estimates. We use this leakage measure to define a rigorous notion of disentanglement and include it as a regularizer during model training to reduce bias. In addition, we incorporate a causal inference estimator, i.e., doubly robust estimator, to ensure more reliable risk estimation. Experiments on standard Learning-to-Rank benchmarks show that our method consistently reduces measured bias leakage and improves ranking performance, especially in realistic scenarios where multiple biases-such as position and trust bias-interact strongly.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CPSR framework improves inductive KGC by adaptively masking noisy structural information and evaluating cumulative semantic contributions along reasoning paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inductive KGC methods struggle with noisy structural information and difficulty capturing long-range dependencies in reasoning paths, limiting their effectiveness with emerging entities in knowledge graphs.

Method: Proposes CPSR framework with two key modules: 1) query-dependent masking to adaptively filter noisy structural information while retaining target-relevant information, and 2) global semantic scoring to evaluate both individual and collective contributions of nodes along reasoning paths.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that CPSR achieves state-of-the-art performance in inductive knowledge graph completion tasks.

Conclusion: CPSR effectively addresses challenges in inductive KGC by simultaneously capturing structural and semantic information, leading to improved performance through adaptive noise filtering and comprehensive path-level semantic reasoning.

Abstract: Conventional Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods aim to infer missing information in incomplete Knowledge Graphs (KGs) by leveraging existing information, which struggle to perform effectively in scenarios involving emerging entities. Inductive KGC methods can handle the emerging entities and relations in KGs, offering greater dynamic adaptability. While existing inductive KGC methods have achieved some success, they also face challenges, such as susceptibility to noisy structural information during reasoning and difficulty in capturing long-range dependencies in reasoning paths. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Cumulative Path-Level Semantic Reasoning for inductive knowledge graph completion (CPSR) framework, which simultaneously captures both the structural and semantic information of KGs to enhance the inductive KGC task. Specifically, the proposed CPSR employs a query-dependent masking module to adaptively mask noisy structural information while retaining important information closely related to the targets. Additionally, CPSR introduces a global semantic scoring module that evaluates both the individual contributions and the collective impact of nodes along the reasoning path within KGs. The experimental results demonstrate that CPSR achieves state-of-the-art performance.

*Emily Cheng,Carmen Amo Alonso,Federico Danieli,Arno Blaas,Luca Zappella,Pau Rodriguez,Xavier Suau*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Theoretical framework for analyzing generative model controllability with formal guarantees on estimation error and empirical validation across dialogue and image generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As generative models become ubiquitous, there's a critical need for fine-grained control, but it's unclear if these models are truly controllable in the first place. The paper aims to formally answer this fundamental question about model controllability.

Method: Framing human-model interaction as a control process, the authors propose a novel algorithm to estimate controllable sets of models in dialogue settings. They provide formal guarantees on estimation error with probably-approximately correct bounds that are distribution-free, require no assumptions except output boundedness, and work for any black-box nonlinear control system (any generative model).

Result: Empirical demonstration on different tasks controlling dialogue processes for both language models and text-to-image generation shows that model controllability is surprisingly fragile and highly dependent on experimental settings.

Conclusion: The work highlights the need for rigorous controllability analysis, shifting focus from simply attempting control to first understanding its fundamental limits. The theoretical framework provides tools to formally assess whether models are truly controllable.

Abstract: As generative models become ubiquitous, there is a critical need for fine-grained control over the generation process. Yet, while controlled generation methods from prompting to fine-tuning proliferate, a fundamental question remains unanswered: are these models truly controllable in the first place? In this work, we provide a theoretical framework to formally answer this question. Framing human-model interaction as a control process, we propose a novel algorithm to estimate the controllable sets of models in a dialogue setting. Notably, we provide formal guarantees on the estimation error as a function of sample complexity: we derive probably-approximately correct bounds for controllable set estimates that are distribution-free, employ no assumptions except for output boundedness, and work for any black-box nonlinear control system (i.e., any generative model). We empirically demonstrate the theoretical framework on different tasks in controlling dialogue processes, for both language models and text-to-image generation. Our results show that model controllability is surprisingly fragile and highly dependent on the experimental setting. This highlights the need for rigorous controllability analysis, shifting the focus from simply attempting control to first understanding its fundamental limits.

*Rongxin Chen,Tianyu Wu,Bingbing Xu,Xiucheng Xu,Huawei Shen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HAG: Hierarchical Agent Generation framework for high-fidelity agent initialization in Agent-Based Modeling, combining macro-level distribution alignment with micro-level individual rationality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for agent initialization either rely on static data-based retrieval (which fails to adapt to unseen topics) or LLM-based generation (which lacks macro-level distribution awareness), leading to inconsistencies between micro-level persona attributes and reality.

Method: HAG formalizes population generation as a two-stage decision process: 1) Uses a World Knowledge Model to infer hierarchical conditional probabilities to construct a Topic-Adaptive Tree for macro-level distribution alignment; 2) Performs instantiation and agentic augmentation grounded in real-world data to ensure micro-level consistency.

Result: HAG significantly outperforms representative baselines, reducing population alignment errors by an average of 37.7% and enhancing sociological consistency by 18.8%.

Conclusion: HAG provides a robust framework for high-fidelity agent initialization that is both topic-adaptive and maintains consistency across macro-level distributions and micro-level individual rationality, addressing key limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: High-fidelity agent initialization is crucial for credible Agent-Based Modeling across diverse domains. A robust framework should be Topic-Adaptive, capturing macro-level joint distributions while ensuring micro-level individual rationality. Existing approaches fall into two categories: static data-based retrieval methods that fail to adapt to unseen topics absent from the data, and LLM-based generation methods that lack macro-level distribution awareness, resulting in inconsistencies between micro-level persona attributes and reality. To address these problems, we propose HAG, a Hierarchical Agent Generation framework that formalizes population generation as a two-stage decision process. Firstly, utilizing a World Knowledge Model to infer hierarchical conditional probabilities to construct the Topic-Adaptive Tree, achieving macro-level distribution alignment. Then, grounded real-world data, instantiation and agentic augmentation are carried out to ensure micro-level consistency. Given the lack of specialized evaluation, we establish a multi-domain benchmark and a comprehensive PACE evaluation framework. Extensive experiments show that HAG significantly outperforms representative baselines, reducing population alignment errors by an average of 37.7% and enhancing sociological consistency by 18.8%.

*Bingyi Liu,Jinbo He,Haiyong Shi,Enshu Wang,Weizhen Han,Jingxiang Hao,Peixi Wang,Zhuangzhuang Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CHDP is a novel framework that treats hybrid action spaces as cooperative games, using discrete and continuous diffusion policies that work together, with codebook compression for high-dimensional discrete actions and sequential updates to avoid conflicts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hybrid action spaces (combining discrete choices and continuous parameters) are common in robot control and game AI, but current methods struggle with limited policy expressiveness and poor scalability in high-dimensional settings.

Method: CHDP frames hybrid action spaces as cooperative games with two agents: one using discrete diffusion policy, another using continuous diffusion policy conditioned on discrete action representations. Uses sequential updates to avoid conflicts, codebook compression for high-dimensional discrete actions, and Q-function guidance to align embeddings.

Result: CHDP outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 19.3% in success rate on challenging hybrid action benchmarks.

Conclusion: The cooperative diffusion approach with specialized policies for discrete and continuous components, combined with codebook compression and sequential updates, effectively addresses the challenges of hybrid action spaces in complex domains.

Abstract: Hybrid action space, which combines discrete choices and continuous parameters, is prevalent in domains such as robot control and game AI. However, efficiently modeling and optimizing hybrid discrete-continuous action space remains a fundamental challenge, mainly due to limited policy expressiveness and poor scalability in high-dimensional settings. To address this challenge, we view the hybrid action space problem as a fully cooperative game and propose a \textbf{Cooperative Hybrid Diffusion Policies (CHDP)} framework to solve it. CHDP employs two cooperative agents that leverage a discrete and a continuous diffusion policy, respectively. The continuous policy is conditioned on the discrete action's representation, explicitly modeling the dependency between them. This cooperative design allows the diffusion policies to leverage their expressiveness to capture complex distributions in their respective action spaces. To mitigate the update conflicts arising from simultaneous policy updates in this cooperative setting, we employ a sequential update scheme that fosters co-adaptation. Moreover, to improve scalability when learning in high-dimensional discrete action space, we construct a codebook that embeds the action space into a low-dimensional latent space. This mapping enables the discrete policy to learn in a compact, structured space. Finally, we design a Q-function-based guidance mechanism to align the codebook's embeddings with the discrete policy's representation during training. On challenging hybrid action benchmarks, CHDP outperforms the state-of-the-art method by up to $19.3\%$ in success rate.

*Zenghao Duan,Liang Pang,Zihao Wei,Wenbin Duan,Yuxin Tian,Shicheng Xu,Jingcheng Deng,Zhiyi Yin,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LRMs suffer from "Circular Reasoning" - self-reinforcing loops where generated content becomes premise for its own recurrence, causing computational waste and inference failure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) frequently encounter repetitive loops during test-time scaling that lead to computational waste and inference failure, requiring systematic analysis of this distinct failure mode.

Method: Introduce LoopBench dataset to capture numerical and statement loops; characterize circular reasoning as state collapse with distinct boundaries; analyze self-reinforcing V-shaped attention mechanism; use Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) algorithm for early loop prediction.

Result: Experiments across diverse LRMs validate the accuracy of early loop prediction and elucidate the stability of long-chain reasoning.

Conclusion: Circular reasoning is a distinct failure mode in LRMs characterized by self-reinforcing loops, and the proposed CUSUM-based approach effectively predicts and analyzes these loops for improved reasoning stability.

Abstract: Despite the success of test-time scaling, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) frequently encounter repetitive loops that lead to computational waste and inference failure. In this paper, we identify a distinct failure mode termed Circular Reasoning. Unlike traditional model degeneration, this phenomenon manifests as a self-reinforcing trap where generated content acts as a logical premise for its own recurrence, compelling the reiteration of preceding text. To systematically analyze this phenomenon, we introduce LoopBench, a dataset designed to capture two distinct loop typologies: numerical loops and statement loops. Mechanistically, we characterize circular reasoning as a state collapse exhibiting distinct boundaries, where semantic repetition precedes textual repetition. We reveal that reasoning impasses trigger the loop onset, which subsequently persists as an inescapable cycle driven by a self-reinforcing V-shaped attention mechanism. Guided by these findings, we employ the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) algorithm to capture these precursors for early loop prediction. Experiments across diverse LRMs validate its accuracy and elucidate the stability of long-chain reasoning.

*Ali Farjami,Luca Redondi,Marco Valentino*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A logic-parametric neuro-symbolic framework that treats logic as a controllable component rather than fixed formalism, enabling systematic comparison of classical/non-classical logics for verifiable natural language inference, with particular focus on normative reasoning domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches combining LLMs and theorem provers for verifiable NLI rely on fixed logical formalisms, which limits robustness and adaptability. The paper aims to overcome this limitation by making logic a first-class, parametric element in neuro-symbolic architectures.

Method: Propose a logic-parametric framework using LogiKEy methodology to embed various classical and non-classical formalisms into higher-order logic (HOL). Compare logic-external approaches (normative requirements via axioms) vs logic-internal approaches (normative patterns from logic's built-in structure). Focus on normative reasoning domains.

Result: Logic-internal strategies consistently improve performance and produce more efficient hybrid proofs for NLI. Effectiveness of logic is domain-dependent: first-order logic favors commonsense reasoning, while deontic and modal logics excel in ethical domains.

Conclusion: Making logic a first-class, parametric element in neuro-symbolic architectures enables more robust, modular, and adaptable reasoning. The framework demonstrates the value of systematic logic comparison and domain-specific logic selection for verifiable natural language inference.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and theorem provers (TPs) can be effectively combined for verifiable natural language inference (NLI). However, existing approaches rely on a fixed logical formalism, a feature that limits robustness and adaptability. We propose a logic-parametric framework for neuro-symbolic NLI that treats the underlying logic not as a static background, but as a controllable component. Using the LogiKEy methodology, we embed a range of classical and non-classical formalisms into higher-order logic (HOL), enabling a systematic comparison of inference quality, explanation refinement, and proof behavior. We focus on normative reasoning, where the choice of logic has significant implications. In particular, we compare logic-external approaches, where normative requirements are encoded via axioms, with logic-internal approaches, where normative patterns emerge from the logic's built-in structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that logic-internal strategies can consistently improve performance and produce more efficient hybrid proofs for NLI. In addition, we show that the effectiveness of a logic is domain-dependent, with first-order logic favouring commonsense reasoning, while deontic and modal logics excel in ethical domains. Our results highlight the value of making logic a first-class, parametric element in neuro-symbolic architectures for more robust, modular, and adaptable reasoning.

TL;DR: HSD is a lossless verification method for speculative decoding that boosts accepted tokens by balancing probability mass across branches, achieving 12% performance gains in EAGLE-3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Verification is a key bottleneck in speculative decoding for improving inference speed while maintaining distribution fidelity. Existing sequence-level verification methods struggle with joint intractability and rely on approximations.

Method: Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD) - a provably lossless verification method that overcomes joint intractability by balancing excess and deficient probability mass across accessible branches.

Result: HSD yields consistent improvements in acceptance rates across diverse model families and benchmarks. Integrating HSD into EAGLE-3 yields over 12% performance gain, establishing state-of-the-art decoding efficiency without compromising distribution fidelity.

Conclusion: HSD provides a strong, explainable, and general verification method that can be integrated into various speculative decoding frameworks to significantly boost decoding efficiency while maintaining distribution fidelity.

Abstract: Verification is a key bottleneck in improving inference speed while maintaining distribution fidelity in Speculative Decoding. Recent work has shown that sequence-level verification leads to a higher number of accepted tokens compared to token-wise verification. However, existing solutions often rely on surrogate approximations or are constrained by partial information, struggling with joint intractability. In this work, we propose Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD), a provably lossless verification method that significantly boosts the expected number of accepted tokens and overcomes joint intractability by balancing excess and deficient probability mass across accessible branches. Our extensive large-scale experiments demonstrate that HSD yields consistent improvements in acceptance rates across diverse model families and benchmarks. Moreover, its strong explainability and generality make it readily integrable into a wide range of speculative decoding frameworks. Notably, integrating HSD into EAGLE-3 yields over a 12% performance gain, establishing state-of-the-art decoding efficiency without compromising distribution fidelity.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PII-VisBench benchmark evaluates VLMs' privacy safety across online presence continuum, finding models more likely to disclose PII for high-visibility subjects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM privacy evaluations treat privacy as static extraction and ignore how a subject's online presence influences privacy alignment, despite VLMs being used in privacy-critical domains.

Method: Created PII-VisBench with 4000 unique probes evaluating 200 subjects stratified into four visibility categories (high, medium, low, zero) based on online information availability. Evaluated 18 open-source VLMs (0.3B-32B) using Refusal Rate and Conditional PII Disclosure Rate metrics.

Result: Models show consistent pattern: refusals increase and PII disclosures decrease (9.10% high to 5.34% low) as subject visibility drops. Models more likely to disclose PII for high-visibility subjects, with substantial model-family heterogeneity and PII-type disparities. Paraphrasing and jailbreak prompts expose attack-dependent failures.

Conclusion: Current VLM privacy evaluations are inadequate; visibility-aware safety evaluation and training interventions are needed to address how online presence influences PII disclosure patterns.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly integrated into privacy-critical domains, yet existing evaluations of personally identifiable information (PII) leakage largely treat privacy as a static extraction task and ignore how a subject's online presence--the volume of their data available online--influences privacy alignment. We introduce PII-VisBench, a novel benchmark containing 4000 unique probes designed to evaluate VLM safety through the continuum of online presence. The benchmark stratifies 200 subjects into four visibility categories: high, medium, low, and zero--based on the extent and nature of their information available online. We evaluate 18 open-source VLMs (0.3B-32B) based on two key metrics: percentage of PII probing queries refused (Refusal Rate) and the fraction of non-refusal responses flagged for containing PII (Conditional PII Disclosure Rate). Across models, we observe a consistent pattern: refusals increase and PII disclosures decrease (9.10% high to 5.34% low) as subject visibility drops. We identify that models are more likely to disclose PII for high-visibility subjects, alongside substantial model-family heterogeneity and PII-type disparities. Finally, paraphrasing and jailbreak-style prompts expose attack and model-dependent failures, motivating visibility-aware safety evaluation and training interventions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DynaDebate introduces dynamic path generation, process-centric debate, and trigger-based verification to overcome limitations of existing multi-agent debate frameworks where agents often converge on identical reasoning paths and degenerate into simple majority voting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) frameworks suffer from unguided initialization causing agents to adopt identical reasoning paths leading to the same errors, hindering effective debate and degenerating into simple majority voting rather than meaningful collaboration.

Method: DynaDebate employs three key mechanisms: 1) Dynamic Path Generation and Allocation using a dedicated Path Generation Agent to create diverse solution paths with adaptive redundancy; 2) Process-Centric Debate focusing on step-by-step logic critique rather than surface-level outcome voting; 3) Trigger-Based Verification Agent activated upon disagreement to use external tools for objective deadlock resolution.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that DynaDebate achieves superior performance across various benchmarks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art MAD methods.

Conclusion: DynaDebate effectively addresses the limitations of current multi-agent debate frameworks by introducing dynamic path diversity, process-focused critique, and objective verification mechanisms, leading to improved collaborative decision-making and problem-solving capabilities.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), which excel at collaborative decision-making and complex problem-solving. Recently, researchers have further investigated Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) frameworks, which enhance the reasoning and collaboration capabilities of MAS through information exchange and debate among multiple agents. However, existing approaches often rely on unguided initialization, causing agents to adopt identical reasoning paths that lead to the same errors. As a result, effective debate among agents is hindered, and the final outcome frequently degenerates into simple majority voting. To solve the above problem, in this paper, we introduce Dynamic Multi-Agent Debate (DynaDebate), which enhances the effectiveness of multi-agent debate through three key mechanisms: (1) Dynamic Path Generation and Allocation, which employs a dedicated Path Generation Agent to generate diverse and logical solution paths with adaptive redundancy; (2) Process-Centric Debate, which shifts the focus from surface-level outcome voting to rigorous step-by-step logic critique to ensure process correctness; (3) A Trigger-Based Verification Agent, which is activated upon disagreement and uses external tools to objectively resolve deadlocks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DynaDebate achieves superior performance across various benchmarks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art MAD methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BEPA improves end-to-end GUI agents by using reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards and expert trajectories, achieving significant performance gains on OSWorld and other GUI benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUI agents face two bottlenecks: limited verifiable tasks/environments and difficulty scaling expert trajectory collection. The paper aims to improve end-to-end policies by effectively leveraging limited expert data through reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards.

Method: Proposes BEPA (Bi-Level Expert-to-Policy Assimilation) with two levels: 1) transforms static expert traces into policy-aligned guidance via self-rolled reachable trajectories under the base policy, and 2) uses a per-task, dynamically updated cache in RLVR to handle distribution shift and structural mismatch.

Result: BEPA improves UITARS1.5-7B success rate from 22.87% to 32.13% on OSWorld-Verified, and raises a held-out split from 5.74% to 10.30%. Shows consistent gains on MMBench-GUI and Online-Mind2Web benchmarks.

Conclusion: BEPA effectively bridges the gap between limited expert trajectories and end-to-end policy learning, demonstrating significant improvements in GUI agent performance across multiple benchmarks while addressing distribution shift and structural mismatch issues.

Abstract: Vision-language models are increasingly deployed as computer-use agents (CUAs) that operate desktops and browsers. Top-performing CUAs are framework-based systems that decompose planning and execution, while end-to-end screenshot-to-action policies are easier to deploy but lag behind on benchmarks such as OSWorld-Verified. GUI datasets like OSWorld pose two bottlenecks: they expose only a few hundred interactive, verifiable tasks and environments, and expert trajectories must be gathered by interacting with these environments, making such data hard to scale. We therefore ask how reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) can best exploit a small pool of exist expert trajectories to train end-to-end policies. Naively mixing these off-policy traces into on-policy RLVR is brittle: even after format conversion, expert trajectories exhibit structural mismatch and distribution shift from the learner. We propose BEPA (Bi-Level Expert-to-Policy Assimilation), which turns static expert traces into policy-aligned guidance via self-rolled reachable trajectories under the base policy (LEVEL-1) and a per-task, dynamically updated cache used in RLVR (LEVEL-2). On OSWorld-Verified, BEPA improves UITARS1.5-7B success from 22.87% to 32.13% and raises a held-out split from 5.74% to 10.30%, with consistent gains on MMBench-GUI and Online-Mind2Web.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized multi-agent systems using LLMs suffer from unstable long-horizon collaboration due to lack of memory management, leading to context bloat, error accumulation, and poor cross-task generalization.

Method: Hierarchical framework with explicit memory control that decouples high-level coordination from subtask execution, uses active task-level memory control, and learns to retrieve/reuse coordination experience via structured experience memory and reinforcement learning.

Result: Experiments on multiple deep-search and agent system benchmarks demonstrate effectiveness in enabling reliable long-horizon multi-agent collaboration.

Conclusion: StackPlanner addresses memory inefficiency and coordination experience reuse challenges in multi-agent systems, enabling more stable and effective long-horizon collaboration.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems based on large language models, particularly centralized architectures, have recently shown strong potential for complex and knowledge-intensive tasks. However, central agents often suffer from unstable long-horizon collaboration due to the lack of memory management, leading to context bloat, error accumulation, and poor cross-task generalization. To address both task-level memory inefficiency and the inability to reuse coordination experience, we propose StackPlanner, a hierarchical multi-agent framework with explicit memory control. StackPlanner addresses these challenges by decoupling high-level coordination from subtask execution with active task-level memory control, and by learning to retrieve and exploit reusable coordination experience via structured experience memory and reinforcement learning. Experiments on multiple deep-search and agent system benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enabling reliable long-horizon multi-agent collaboration.

TL;DR: TowerMind is a lightweight, multimodal tower defense environment for evaluating LLMs' planning and decision-making capabilities, revealing performance gaps with humans and highlighting key LLM limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RTS game environments for evaluating LLMs have high computational demands or lack textual observations, limiting their use for comprehensive LLM assessment of planning and decision-making capabilities.

Method: Developed TowerMind, a tower defense RTS environment with low computational demands and multimodal observations (pixel-based, textual, structured game-state). Includes five benchmark levels and supports evaluation of model hallucination with high customizability.

Result: LLMs show clear performance gaps compared to human experts in both capability and hallucination dimensions. Experiments reveal key LLM limitations: inadequate planning validation, lack of multifinality in decision-making, and inefficient action use.

Conclusion: TowerMind provides a lightweight, multimodal benchmark that complements existing RTS environments and introduces a new evaluation standard for AI agents, highlighting current LLM limitations in strategic planning and decision-making.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have positioned them as a promising paradigm for agents, with long-term planning and decision-making emerging as core general-purpose capabilities for adapting to diverse scenarios and tasks. Real-time strategy (RTS) games serve as an ideal testbed for evaluating these two capabilities, as their inherent gameplay requires both macro-level strategic planning and micro-level tactical adaptation and action execution. Existing RTS game-based environments either suffer from relatively high computational demands or lack support for textual observations, which has constrained the use of RTS games for LLM evaluation. Motivated by this, we present TowerMind, a novel environment grounded in the tower defense (TD) subgenre of RTS games. TowerMind preserves the key evaluation strengths of RTS games for assessing LLMs, while featuring low computational demands and a multimodal observation space, including pixel-based, textual, and structured game-state representations. In addition, TowerMind supports the evaluation of model hallucination and provides a high degree of customizability. We design five benchmark levels to evaluate several widely used LLMs under different multimodal input settings. The results reveal a clear performance gap between LLMs and human experts across both capability and hallucination dimensions. The experiments further highlight key limitations in LLM behavior, such as inadequate planning validation, a lack of multifinality in decision-making, and inefficient action use. We also evaluate two classic reinforcement learning algorithms: Ape-X DQN and PPO. By offering a lightweight and multimodal design, TowerMind complements the existing RTS game-based environment landscape and introduces a new benchmark for the AI agent field.

Motivation: Linguistic ambiguity in safety-critical domains (like surgery) can cause catastrophic errors, but embodied AI research overlooks this by assuming clear instructions.

Result: State-of-the-art 3D LLMs struggle with ambiguity detection; AmbiVer framework shows effectiveness in addressing this challenge.

Conclusion: Paves way for safer embodied AI by addressing critical safety gap in instruction ambiguity detection in 3D environments.

Abstract: In safety-critical domains, linguistic ambiguity can have severe consequences; a vague command like "Pass me the vial" in a surgical setting could lead to catastrophic errors. Yet, most embodied AI research overlooks this, assuming instructions are clear and focusing on execution rather than confirmation. To address this critical safety gap, we are the first to define Open-Vocabulary 3D Instruction Ambiguity Detection, a fundamental new task where a model must determine if a command has a single, unambiguous meaning within a given 3D scene. To support this research, we build Ambi3D, the large-scale benchmark for this task, featuring over 700 diverse 3D scenes and around 22k instructions. Our analysis reveals a surprising limitation: state-of-the-art 3D Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to reliably determine if an instruction is ambiguous. To address this challenge, we propose AmbiVer, a two-stage framework that collects explicit visual evidence from multiple views and uses it to guide an vision-language model (VLM) in judging instruction ambiguity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the challenge of our task and the effectiveness of AmbiVer, paving the way for safer and more trustworthy embodied AI.
