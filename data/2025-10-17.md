*Yue Hu,Guohang Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiFoodChat is a dialogue-driven multi-agent framework for zero-shot food recognition that combines vision-language models and large language models to achieve superior accuracy without training on labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing supervised food classification models require large labeled datasets and have poor generalization to unseen food categories, limiting their practical applications in food quality inspection and dietary assessment.

Method: The framework integrates VLMs and LLMs for collaborative reasoning through multi-round visual-textual dialogues, using an Object Perception Token (OPT) for fine-grained visual attributes and an Interactive Reasoning Agent (IRA) for dynamic contextual interpretation.

Result: Experiments on multiple public food datasets show MultiFoodChat achieves superior recognition accuracy and interpretability compared to existing unsupervised and few-shot methods.

Conclusion: MultiFoodChat represents a new paradigm for intelligent food quality inspection and analysis, enabling flexible, human-like understanding of complex food scenes without additional training or manual annotations.

Abstract: Food image classification plays a vital role in intelligent food quality
inspection, dietary assessment, and automated monitoring. However, most
existing supervised models rely heavily on large labeled datasets and exhibit
limited generalization to unseen food categories. To overcome these challenges,
this study introduces MultiFoodChat, a dialogue-driven multi-agent reasoning
framework for zero-shot food recognition. The framework integrates
vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) to enable
collaborative reasoning through multi-round visual-textual dialogues. An Object
Perception Token (OPT) captures fine-grained visual attributes, while an
Interactive Reasoning Agent (IRA) dynamically interprets contextual cues to
refine predictions. This multi-agent design allows flexible and human-like
understanding of complex food scenes without additional training or manual
annotations. Experiments on multiple public food datasets demonstrate that
MultiFoodChat achieves superior recognition accuracy and interpretability
compared with existing unsupervised and few-shot methods, highlighting its
potential as a new paradigm for intelligent food quality inspection and
analysis.

*Andreas Leibetseder,Klaus Schoeffmann,Jörg Keckstein,Simon Keckstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A system for segmenting dark endometrial implants in laparoscopic surgery videos to assist gynecologic physicians in identifying endometriosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Endometriosis is difficult to identify due to its varied visual appearance and locations, making it challenging for non-specialists. The system aims to help gynecologic physicians by providing automated detection assistance.

Method: The system is trained to segment dark endometrial implants and can analyze laparoscopic surgery videos, annotate identified regions with multi-colored overlays, and display detection summaries.

Result: The system successfully identifies and segments dark endometrial implants in laparoscopic videos, providing visual annotations and detection summaries for improved video browsing.

Conclusion: The developed system offers valuable assistance to gynecologic physicians by automating the detection of dark endometrial implants, potentially improving accuracy and efficiency in endometriosis diagnosis and treatment.

Abstract: Endometriosis is a common women's condition exhibiting a manifold visual
appearance in various body-internal locations. Having such properties makes its
identification very difficult and error-prone, at least for laymen and
non-specialized medical practitioners. In an attempt to provide assistance to
gynecologic physicians treating endometriosis, this demo paper describes a
system that is trained to segment one frequently occurring visual appearance of
endometriosis, namely dark endometrial implants. The system is capable of
analyzing laparoscopic surgery videos, annotating identified implant regions
with multi-colored overlays and displaying a detection summary for improved
video browsing.

### [3] [Efficient Few-Shot Learning in Remote Sensing: Fusing Vision and Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13993)
*Jia Yun Chua,Argyrios Zolotas,Miguel Arana-Catania*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper combines traditional vision models (YOLO) with Vision Language Models (LLaVA, ChatGPT, Gemini) to improve remote sensing image analysis, achieving significant improvements in aircraft detection accuracy and scene understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional vision models in remote sensing are limited by requiring extensive labeled data and poor contextual understanding. VLMs offer complementary capabilities but remain underexplored in remote sensing applications.

Method: Integration of YOLO with VLMs (LLaVA, ChatGPT, Gemini) for enhanced image analysis in remote sensing, focusing on aircraft detection and scene understanding. Evaluation includes labeled/unlabeled data and degraded image scenarios.

Result: 48.46% average MAE improvement in aircraft detection and counting accuracy, particularly in challenging conditions. 6.17% improvement in CLIPScore for comprehensive scene understanding. Effective performance in both raw and degraded scenarios.

Conclusion: The combination of traditional vision models and VLMs enables more advanced and efficient remote sensing image analysis, especially beneficial for few-shot learning scenarios.

Abstract: Remote sensing has become a vital tool across sectors such as urban planning,
environmental monitoring, and disaster response. While the volume of data
generated has increased significantly, traditional vision models are often
constrained by the requirement for extensive domain-specific labelled data and
their limited ability to understand the context within complex environments.
Vision Language Models offer a complementary approach by integrating visual and
textual data; however, their application to remote sensing remains
underexplored, particularly given their generalist nature. This work
investigates the combination of vision models and VLMs to enhance image
analysis in remote sensing, with a focus on aircraft detection and scene
understanding. The integration of YOLO with VLMs such as LLaVA, ChatGPT, and
Gemini aims to achieve more accurate and contextually aware image
interpretation. Performance is evaluated on both labelled and unlabelled remote
sensing data, as well as degraded image scenarios which are crucial for remote
sensing. The findings show an average MAE improvement of 48.46% across models
in the accuracy of aircraft detection and counting, especially in challenging
conditions, in both raw and degraded scenarios. A 6.17% improvement in
CLIPScore for comprehensive understanding of remote sensing images is obtained.
The proposed approach combining traditional vision models and VLMs paves the
way for more advanced and efficient remote sensing image analysis, especially
in few-shot learning scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AI model detects cribriform morphology in prostate cancer with pathologist-level performance, outperforming experts in agreement and showing strong validation across multiple cohorts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cribriform morphology in prostate cancer indicates poor prognosis but is underreported and has high interobserver variability among pathologists, creating need for standardized detection.

Method: Deep learning model using EfficientNetV2-S encoder with multiple instance learning for whole-slide classification, trained on 640 prostate biopsies from 430 patients across three cohorts, validated internally and externally.

Result: Model achieved AUC 0.97 (internal) and 0.90 (external) with Cohen's kappa 0.81 and 0.55 respectively. Outperformed all 9 expert pathologists in inter-rater analysis with highest average agreement (kappa 0.66 vs 0.35-0.62).

Conclusion: AI model demonstrates pathologist-level performance for cribriform morphology detection, potentially enhancing diagnostic reliability, standardizing reporting, and improving prostate cancer treatment decisions.

Abstract: Background: Cribriform morphology in prostate cancer is a histological
feature that indicates poor prognosis and contraindicates active surveillance.
However, it remains underreported and subject to significant interobserver
variability amongst pathologists. We aimed to develop and validate an AI-based
system to improve cribriform pattern detection.
  Methods: We created a deep learning model using an EfficientNetV2-S encoder
with multiple instance learning for end-to-end whole-slide classification. The
model was trained on 640 digitised prostate core needle biopsies from 430
patients, collected across three cohorts. It was validated internally (261
slides from 171 patients) and externally (266 slides, 104 patients from three
independent cohorts). Internal validation cohorts included laboratories or
scanners from the development set, while external cohorts used completely
independent instruments and laboratories. Annotations were provided by three
expert uropathologists with known high concordance. Additionally, we conducted
an inter-rater analysis and compared the model's performance against nine
expert uropathologists on 88 slides from the internal validation cohort.
  Results: The model showed strong internal validation performance (AUC: 0.97,
95% CI: 0.95-0.99; Cohen's kappa: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72-0.89) and robust external
validation (AUC: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.86-0.93; Cohen's kappa: 0.55, 95% CI:
0.45-0.64). In our inter-rater analysis, the model achieved the highest average
agreement (Cohen's kappa: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.57-0.74), outperforming all nine
pathologists whose Cohen's kappas ranged from 0.35 to 0.62.
  Conclusion: Our AI model demonstrates pathologist-level performance for
cribriform morphology detection in prostate cancer. This approach could enhance
diagnostic reliability, standardise reporting, and improve treatment decisions
for prostate cancer patients.

### [5] [NAPPure: Adversarial Purification for Robust Image Classification under Non-Additive Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14025)
*Junjie Nan,Jianing Li,Wei Chen,Mingkun Zhang,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NAPPure is an adversarial purification framework that handles non-additive perturbations like blur, occlusion, and distortion, unlike existing methods that only work with additive perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial purification methods are ineffective against non-additive perturbations (blur, occlusion, distortion) since they're designed for additive perturbations, which limits their real-world applicability.

Method: Establishes the generation process of adversarial images and disentangles clean images from perturbation parameters through likelihood maximization.

Result: Experiments on GTSRB and CIFAR-10 datasets show NAPPure significantly boosts model robustness against non-additive perturbations.

Conclusion: NAPPure extends adversarial purification to effectively handle non-additive perturbations, improving real-world robustness of image classification models.

Abstract: Adversarial purification has achieved great success in combating adversarial
image perturbations, which are usually assumed to be additive. However,
non-additive adversarial perturbations such as blur, occlusion, and distortion
are also common in the real world. Under such perturbations, existing
adversarial purification methods are much less effective since they are
designed to fit the additive nature. In this paper, we propose an extended
adversarial purification framework named NAPPure, which can further handle
non-additive perturbations. Specifically, we first establish the generation
process of an adversarial image, and then disentangle the underlying clean
image and perturbation parameters through likelihood maximization. Experiments
on GTSRB and CIFAR-10 datasets show that NAPPure significantly boosts the
robustness of image classification models against non-additive perturbations.

### [6] [Vgent: Graph-based Retrieval-Reasoning-Augmented Generation For Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14032)
*Xiaoqian Shen,Wenxuan Zhang,Jun Chen,Mohamed Elhoseiny*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vgent is a graph-based retrieval-reasoning-augmented generation framework that enhances large video language models for long video understanding by preserving temporal dependencies through structured graphs and introducing intermediate reasoning steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large video language models struggle with processing intensive video tokens beyond context windows and retaining long-term sequential information in long videos. Existing RAG approaches face challenges with disrupted temporal dependencies and irrelevant information inclusion.

Method: Proposes Vgent framework with two key innovations: (1) represents videos as structured graphs preserving semantic relationships across clips, (2) introduces intermediate reasoning step with structured verification to reduce retrieval noise and aggregate relevant information across clips.

Result: Achieved 3.0%-5.4% overall performance improvement over base models on MLVU benchmark, and outperformed state-of-the-art video RAG methods by 8.6% across three long-video understanding benchmarks.

Conclusion: Vgent effectively addresses long video understanding challenges by combining graph-based retrieval with intermediate reasoning, significantly improving LVLM performance while preserving temporal dependencies and reducing irrelevant information.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over long videos pose significant challenges for
large video language models (LVLMs) due to the difficulty in processing
intensive video tokens beyond context window and retaining long-term sequential
information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated
effectiveness in processing long context for Large Language Models (LLMs);
however, applying RAG to long video faces challenges such as disrupted temporal
dependencies and inclusion of irrelevant information that can hinder accurate
reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Vgent, a novel graph-based
retrieval-reasoning-augmented generation framework to enhance LVLMs for long
video understanding. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (i) It
represents videos by structured graphs with semantic relationships across video
clips preserved to improve retrieval effectiveness. (ii) It introduces an
intermediate reasoning step to mitigate the reasoning limitation of LVLMs,
which leverages structured verification to reduce retrieval noise and
facilitate the explicit aggregation of relevant information across clips,
resulting in more accurate and context-aware responses. We comprehensively
evaluate our framework with various open-source LVLMs on three long-video
understanding benchmarks. Our approach yielded an overall performance
improvement of $3.0\%\sim 5.4\%$ over base models on MLVU, and outperformed
state-of-the-art video RAG methods by $8.6\%$. Our code is publicly available

*Avihai Naaman,Ron Shapira Weber,Oren Freifeld*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TPL is a prototype-based framework that creates compact 1D representations from video embeddings to robustly synchronize videos across different scenes and generative AI content by learning unified prototype sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synchronizing videos from different scenes or generative AI videos is challenging due to diverse subjects, backgrounds, and nonlinear temporal misalignment, requiring more sophisticated approaches than simple time shifts.

Method: Temporal Prototype Learning (TPL) constructs shared, compact 1D representations from high-dimensional embeddings using pretrained models, learning unified prototype sequences that anchor key action phases to avoid exhaustive pairwise matching.

Result: TPL improves synchronization accuracy, efficiency, and robustness across diverse datasets, including fine-grained frame retrieval and phase classification tasks, and is the first approach to address synchronization in multiple generative AI videos.

Conclusion: TPL provides an effective framework for video synchronization that handles complex scenarios including generative AI content, with demonstrated improvements in performance and efficiency across various tasks.

Abstract: Synchronizing videos captured simultaneously from multiple cameras in the
same scene is often easy and typically requires only simple time shifts.
However, synchronizing videos from different scenes or, more recently,
generative AI videos, poses a far more complex challenge due to diverse
subjects, backgrounds, and nonlinear temporal misalignment. We propose Temporal
Prototype Learning (TPL), a prototype-based framework that constructs a shared,
compact 1D representation from high-dimensional embeddings extracted by any of
various pretrained models. TPL robustly aligns videos by learning a unified
prototype sequence that anchors key action phases, thereby avoiding exhaustive
pairwise matching. Our experiments show that TPL improves synchronization
accuracy, efficiency, and robustness across diverse datasets, including
fine-grained frame retrieval and phase classification tasks. Importantly, TPL
is the first approach to mitigate synchronization issues in multiple generative
AI videos depicting the same action. Our code and a new multiple video
synchronization dataset are available at https://bgu-cs-vil.github.io/TPL/

Abstract: We present a novel, zero-shot pipeline for creating hyperrealistic,
identity-preserving 3D avatars from a few unstructured phone images. Existing
methods face several challenges: single-view approaches suffer from geometric
inconsistencies and hallucinations, degrading identity preservation, while
models trained on synthetic data fail to capture high-frequency details like
skin wrinkles and fine hair, limiting realism. Our method introduces two key
contributions: (1) a generative canonicalization module that processes multiple
unstructured views into a standardized, consistent representation, and (2) a
transformer-based model trained on a new, large-scale dataset of high-fidelity
Gaussian splatting avatars derived from dome captures of real people. This
"Capture, Canonicalize, Splat" pipeline produces static quarter-body avatars
with compelling realism and robust identity preservation from unstructured

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: cubic is a Python library that provides GPU-accelerated bioimage analysis by extending SciPy and scikit-image APIs with CuPy and RAPIDS cuCIM, enabling faster processing of 2D/3D biological images while maintaining compatibility with existing workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing bioimage analysis tools face scalability issues with large microscopy datasets, lack GPU acceleration, have poor 3D processing capabilities, and lack modern APIs for integration with scientific computing workflows.

Method: cubic extends widely used SciPy and scikit-image APIs with GPU-accelerated alternatives from CuPy and RAPIDS cuCIM, using a device-agnostic approach that automatically dispatches operations to GPU when data are available on device.

Result: cubic achieves substantial speedups in bioimage analysis workflows while maintaining algorithmic fidelity, enabling faster preprocessing, segmentation, and feature extraction for both 2D and 3D data.

Conclusion: cubic provides a robust foundation for scalable, reproducible bioimage analysis that integrates with the broader Python scientific computing ecosystem, supporting both interactive exploration and automated high-throughput workflows.

Abstract: Quantitative analysis of multidimensional biological images is useful for
understanding complex cellular phenotypes and accelerating advances in
biomedical research. As modern microscopy generates ever-larger 2D and 3D
datasets, existing computational approaches are increasingly limited by their
scalability, efficiency, and integration with modern scientific computing
workflows. Existing bioimage analysis tools often lack application programmable
interfaces (APIs), do not support graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration,
lack broad 3D image processing capabilities, and/or have poor interoperability
for compute-heavy workflows. Here, we introduce cubic, an open-source Python
library that addresses these challenges by augmenting widely used SciPy and
scikit-image APIs with GPU-accelerated alternatives from CuPy and RAPIDS cuCIM.
cubic's API is device-agnostic and dispatches operations to GPU when data
reside on the device and otherwise executes on CPU, seamlessly accelerating a
broad range of image processing routines. This approach enables GPU
acceleration of existing bioimage analysis workflows, from preprocessing to
segmentation and feature extraction for 2D and 3D data. We evaluate cubic both
by benchmarking individual operations and by reproducing existing deconvolution
and segmentation pipelines, achieving substantial speedups while maintaining
algorithmic fidelity. These advances establish a robust foundation for
scalable, reproducible bioimage analysis that integrates with the broader
Python scientific computing ecosystem, including other GPU-accelerated methods,
enabling both interactive exploration and automated high-throughput analysis
workflows. cubic is openly available at

Conclusion: The framework advances the integration of video generation into virtual production by providing comprehensive capabilities for character consistency, camera control, and lighting adaptation.

Abstract: We introduce a framework that enables both multi-view character consistency
and 3D camera control in video diffusion models through a novel customization
data pipeline. We train the character consistency component with recorded
volumetric capture performances re-rendered with diverse camera trajectories
via 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS), lighting variability obtained with a video
relighting model. We fine-tune state-of-the-art open-source video diffusion
models on this data to provide strong multi-view identity preservation, precise
camera control, and lighting adaptability. Our framework also supports core
capabilities for virtual production, including multi-subject generation using
two approaches: joint training and noise blending, the latter enabling
efficient composition of independently customized models at inference time; it
also achieves scene and real-life video customization as well as control over
motion and spatial layout during customization. Extensive experiments show
improved video quality, higher personalization accuracy, and enhanced camera
control and lighting adaptability, advancing the integration of video

### [11] [Joint Modeling of Big Five and HEXACO for Multimodal Apparent Personality-trait Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14203)
*Ryo Masumura,Shota Orihashi,Mana Ihori,Tomohiro Tanaka,Naoki Makishima,Taiga Yamane,Naotaka Kawata,Satoshi Suzuki,Taichi Katayama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a joint modeling method for recognizing both Big Five and HEXACO personality traits from multimodal human behavior, improving awareness of human behavior by considering their relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies only used Big Five for personality recognition, ignoring HEXACO which can evaluate important traits like Honesty-Humility related to aggression and social dominance. The relationships between Big Five and HEXACO in machine learning models remain unclear.

Method: Joint optimization method for recognizing both Big Five and HEXACO personality traits from multimodal human behavior data.

Result: Experiments using self-introduction video dataset demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively recognize both Big Five and HEXACO traits.

Conclusion: The joint modeling approach successfully recognizes both personality frameworks, improving multimodal human behavior understanding by leveraging their interrelationships.

Abstract: This paper proposes a joint modeling method of the Big Five, which has long
been studied, and HEXACO, which has recently attracted attention in psychology,
for automatically recognizing apparent personality traits from multimodal human
behavior. Most previous studies have used the Big Five for multimodal apparent
personality-trait recognition. However, no study has focused on apparent HEXACO
which can evaluate an Honesty-Humility trait related to displaced aggression
and vengefulness, social-dominance orientation, etc. In addition, the
relationships between the Big Five and HEXACO when modeled by machine learning
have not been clarified. We expect awareness of multimodal human behavior to
improve by considering these relationships. The key advance of our proposed
method is to optimize jointly recognizing the Big Five and HEXACO. Experiments
using a self-introduction video dataset demonstrate that the proposed method
can effectively recognize the Big Five and HEXACO.

*Hongsong Wang,Renxi Cheng,Yang Zhang,Chaolei Han,Jie Gui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method for detecting AI-generated images using bit-plane-based noise analysis, achieving 98.9% accuracy with millisecond-level processing speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-generated image detection methods have high computational costs and fail to capture intrinsic noisy features in raw images, making it difficult to distinguish AI-generated images from real ones.

Method: Uses bit-plane-based image processing to extract noise patterns, applies image normalization strategies, designs maximum gradient patch selection to amplify noise signals, and proposes lightweight classification heads (noise-based and noise-guided classifiers).

Result: Achieves 98.9% average accuracy on GenImage benchmark (11.9% improvement), excellent cross-generator generalization (98.2% from GAN to Diffusion, 99.2% from Diffusion to GAN), and millisecond-level processing that's nearly 100x faster than existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed bit-plane-based noise analysis method provides an effective and efficient solution for AI-generated image detection with superior accuracy, generalization capability, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of GAN and Diffusion models makes it more difficult to
distinguish AI-generated images from real ones. Recent studies often use
image-based reconstruction errors as an important feature for determining
whether an image is AI-generated. However, these approaches typically incur
high computational costs and also fail to capture intrinsic noisy features
present in the raw images. To solve these problems, we innovatively refine
error extraction by using bit-plane-based image processing, as lower bit planes
indeed represent noise patterns in images. We introduce an effective bit-planes
guided noisy image generation and exploit various image normalization
strategies, including scaling and thresholding. Then, to amplify the noise
signal for easier AI-generated image detection, we design a maximum gradient
patch selection that applies multi-directional gradients to compute the noise
score and selects the region with the highest score. Finally, we propose a
lightweight and effective classification head and explore two different
structures: noise-based classifier and noise-guided classifier. Extensive
experiments on the GenImage benchmark demonstrate the outstanding performance
of our method, which achieves an average accuracy of \textbf{98.9\%}
(\textbf{11.9}\%~$\uparrow$) and shows excellent cross-generator generalization
capability. Particularly, our method achieves an accuracy of over 98.2\% from
GAN to Diffusion and over 99.2\% from Diffusion to GAN. Moreover, it performs
error extraction at the millisecond level, nearly a hundred times faster than
existing methods. The code is at https://github.com/hongsong-wang/LOTA.

### [13] [PIA: Deepfake Detection Using Phoneme-Temporal and Identity-Dynamic Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14241)
*Soumyya Kanti Datta,Tanvi Ranga,Chengzhe Sun,Siwei Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PIA is a novel multimodal audio-visual framework that detects deepfakes by analyzing phoneme-temporal relationships, dynamic face motion, and facial identity cues, addressing limitations of traditional detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deepfake detection methods fail against advanced generative models (GANs, diffusion models, neural rendering) that create nearly perfect individual frames but leave subtle temporal discrepancies that conventional detectors miss.

Method: Uses multimodal audio-visual analysis combining phoneme sequences, lip geometry data, and advanced facial identity embeddings to identify inconsistencies across language, dynamic face motion, and facial identification cues.

Result: The integrated method significantly improves detection of subtle deepfake alterations by leveraging multiple complementary modalities rather than relying on single detection strategies.

Conclusion: PIA framework effectively addresses modern deepfake threats by capturing temporal inconsistencies and multimodal discrepancies that traditional methods overlook, providing more robust detection against advanced generative manipulations.

Abstract: The rise of manipulated media has made deepfakes a particularly insidious
threat, involving various generative manipulations such as lip-sync
modifications, face-swaps, and avatar-driven facial synthesis. Conventional
detection methods, which predominantly depend on manually designed
phoneme-viseme alignment thresholds, fundamental frame-level consistency
checks, or a unimodal detection strategy, inadequately identify modern-day
deepfakes generated by advanced generative models such as GANs, diffusion
models, and neural rendering techniques. These advanced techniques generate
nearly perfect individual frames yet inadvertently create minor temporal
discrepancies frequently overlooked by traditional detectors. We present a
novel multimodal audio-visual framework, Phoneme-Temporal and Identity-Dynamic
Analysis(PIA), incorporating language, dynamic face motion, and facial
identification cues to address these limitations. We utilize phoneme sequences,
lip geometry data, and advanced facial identity embeddings. This integrated
method significantly improves the detection of subtle deepfake alterations by
identifying inconsistencies across multiple complementary modalities. Code is

### [14] [Event Interval Modulation: A Novel Scheme for Event-based Optical Camera Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14245)
*Miu Sumino,Mayu Ishii,Shun Kaizu,Daisuke Hisano,Yu Nakayama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Event Interval Modulation (EIM) for event-based optical camera communication, achieving 28 kbps over 10m and 8.4 kbps over 50m - setting new bit rate benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing event-based OCC systems use conventional modulation schemes that don't fully exploit the unique characteristics of event-based vision sensors, limiting performance.

Method: Developed Event Interval Modulation (EIM) scheme that modulates information using intervals between events, tuned EVS parameters for optimal frequency response, and conducted proof-of-concept transmission experiments.

Result: Achieved successful transmission at 28 kbps over 10 meters and 8.4 kbps over 50 meters in indoor environment, setting new benchmark for bit rate in event-based OCC systems.

Conclusion: EIM effectively leverages the unique characteristics of event-based vision sensors to significantly improve transmission speed in optical camera communication systems.

Abstract: Optical camera communication (OCC) represents a promising visible light
communication technology. Nonetheless, typical OCC systems utilizing
frame-based cameras are encumbered by limitations, including low bit rate and
high processing load. To address these issues, OCC system utilizing an
event-based vision sensor (EVS) as receivers have been proposed. The EVS
enables high-speed, low-latency, and robust communication due to its
asynchronous operation and high dynamic range. In existing event-based OCC
systems, conventional modulation schemes such as on-off keying (OOK) and pulse
position modulation have been applied, however, to the best of our knowledge,
no modulation method has been proposed that fully exploits the unique
characteristics of the EVS. This paper proposes a novel modulation scheme,
called the event interval modulation (EIM) scheme, specifically designed for
event-based OCC. EIM enables improvement in transmission speed by modulating
information using the intervals between events. This paper proposes a
theoretical model of EIM and conducts a proof-of-concept experiment. First, the
parameters of the EVS are tuned and customized to optimize the frequency
response specifically for EIM. Then, the maximum modulation order usable in EIM
is determined experimentally. We conduct transmission experiments based on the
obtained parameters. Finally, we report successful transmission at 28 kbps over
10 meters and 8.4 kbps over 50 meters in an indoor environment. This sets a new
benchmark for bit rate in event-based OCC systems.

TL;DR: MACE enables efficient localization and high-quality rendering in large-scale scenes using mixed expert networks and auxiliary-loss-free load balancing, achieving significant cost reduction while maintaining high precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods work well for small-scale localization but face limitations in large-scale scenes due to single network capacity constraints. There's a need for efficient solutions that can handle large-scale scene applications.

Method: Proposed Mixed Expert-based Accelerated Coordinate Encoding (MACE) with a gating network to implicitly classify and select sub-networks, ensuring only one sub-network is activated per inference. Also introduced Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing (ALF-LB) strategy to enhance localization accuracy.

Result: Achieves significant cost reduction while maintaining higher precision. On Cambridge test set, achieves high-quality rendering results with only 10 minutes of training.

Conclusion: MACE provides an efficient solution for large-scale scene applications, offering both efficient localization and high-quality rendering capabilities.

Abstract: Efficient localization and high-quality rendering in large-scale scenes
remain a significant challenge due to the computational cost involved. While
Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods perform well in small-scale
localization, they are limited by the capacity of a single network when
extended to large-scale scenes. To address these challenges, we propose the
Mixed Expert-based Accelerated Coordinate Encoding method (MACE), which enables
efficient localization and high-quality rendering in large-scale scenes.
Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of MOE in large model domains, we
introduce a gating network to implicitly classify and select sub-networks,
ensuring that only a single sub-network is activated during each inference.
Furtheremore, we present Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing(ALF-LB) strategy to
enhance the localization accuracy on large-scale scene. Our framework provides
a significant reduction in costs while maintaining higher precision, offering
an efficient solution for large-scale scene applications. Additional
experiments on the Cambridge test set demonstrate that our method achieves
high-quality rendering results with merely 10 minutes of training.

*Liao Shen,Wentao Jiang,Yiran Zhu,Tiezheng Ge,Zhiguo Cao,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IPRO is a reinforcement learning-based video diffusion framework that enhances identity preservation in image-to-video generation by optimizing models using a face identity scorer and KL-divergence regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image-to-video models struggle with maintaining identity consistency, especially when human faces are small or undergo significant expression changes and movements, which is critical for human-centric video generation.

Method: Proposes Identity-Preserving Reward-guided Optimization (IPRO) that backpropagates reward signals through the last sampling steps, uses a facial scoring mechanism with ground-truth videos as facial feature pools, and incorporates KL-divergence regularization for stability.

Result: Extensive experiments on Wan 2.2 I2V model and in-house I2V model demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in enhancing identity preservation.

Conclusion: IPRO provides a direct and effective tuning algorithm for improving identity consistency in human-centric video generation without requiring auxiliary modules or architectural changes.

Abstract: Recent advances in image-to-video (I2V) generation have achieved remarkable
progress in synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent videos from static
images. Among all the applications of I2V, human-centric video generation
includes a large portion. However, existing I2V models encounter difficulties
in maintaining identity consistency between the input human image and the
generated video, especially when the person in the video exhibits significant
expression changes and movements. This issue becomes critical when the human
face occupies merely a small fraction of the image. Since humans are highly
sensitive to identity variations, this poses a critical yet under-explored
challenge in I2V generation. In this paper, we propose Identity-Preserving
Reward-guided Optimization (IPRO), a novel video diffusion framework based on
reinforcement learning to enhance identity preservation. Instead of introducing
auxiliary modules or altering model architectures, our approach introduces a
direct and effective tuning algorithm that optimizes diffusion models using a
face identity scorer. To improve performance and accelerate convergence, our
method backpropagates the reward signal through the last steps of the sampling
chain, enabling richer gradient feedback. We also propose a novel facial
scoring mechanism that treats faces in ground-truth videos as facial feature
pools, providing multi-angle facial information to enhance generalization. A
KL-divergence regularization is further incorporated to stabilize training and
prevent overfitting to the reward signal. Extensive experiments on Wan 2.2 I2V
model and our in-house I2V model demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: Identity-GRPO is a human feedback-driven optimization pipeline that improves multi-human identity preservation in video generation, achieving up to 18.9% better consistency than baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation methods like VACE and Phantom struggle with maintaining consistent identities across multiple human characters in dynamic interactions, which is critical for realistic video generation.

Method: The approach involves: 1) constructing a video reward model trained on large-scale preference data with human-annotated and synthetic distortion annotations focused on human consistency, and 2) employing a GRPO variant specifically tailored for multi-human consistency optimization.

Result: Identity-GRPO achieves up to 18.9% improvement in human consistency metrics over baseline methods, and the approach successfully enhances both VACE and Phantom video generation systems.

Conclusion: The method provides actionable insights for aligning reinforcement learning with personalized video generation, demonstrating significant improvements in multi-human identity preservation through human feedback-driven optimization.

Abstract: While advanced methods like VACE and Phantom have advanced video generation
for specific subjects in diverse scenarios, they struggle with multi-human
identity preservation in dynamic interactions, where consistent identities
across multiple characters are critical. To address this, we propose
Identity-GRPO, a human feedback-driven optimization pipeline for refining
multi-human identity-preserving video generation. First, we construct a video
reward model trained on a large-scale preference dataset containing
human-annotated and synthetic distortion data, with pairwise annotations
focused on maintaining human consistency throughout the video. We then employ a
GRPO variant tailored for multi-human consistency, which greatly enhances both
VACE and Phantom. Through extensive ablation studies, we evaluate the impact of
annotation quality and design choices on policy optimization. Experiments show
that Identity-GRPO achieves up to 18.9% improvement in human consistency
metrics over baseline methods, offering actionable insights for aligning
reinforcement learning with personalized video generation.

*Tingman Yan,Tao Liu,Xilian Yang,Qunfei Zhao,Zeyang Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MatchAttention for cross-view matching with dynamic relative position matching and BilinearSoftmax for efficient attention sampling, achieving state-of-the-art performance with low computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution image matching is challenging due to quadratic complexity and lack of explicit matching constraints in existing cross-attention mechanisms.

Method: MatchAttention dynamically matches relative positions using BilinearSoftmax for continuous sliding-window attention sampling, with hierarchical MatchDecoder and occlusion handling via gated cross-MatchAttention and consistency-constrained loss.

Result: MatchStereo-B ranked 1st on Middlebury benchmark, processes KITTI-resolution in 29ms, MatchStereo-T handles 4K UHD in 0.1s with 3GB GPU memory, achieving SOTA on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Enables real-time, high-resolution, high-accuracy cross-view matching through efficient attention mechanism design.

Abstract: Cross-view matching is fundamentally achieved through cross-attention
mechanisms. However, matching of high-resolution images remains challenging due
to the quadratic complexity and lack of explicit matching constraints in the
existing cross-attention. This paper proposes an attention mechanism,
MatchAttention, that dynamically matches relative positions. The relative
position determines the attention sampling center of the key-value pairs given
a query. Continuous and differentiable sliding-window attention sampling is
achieved by the proposed BilinearSoftmax. The relative positions are
iteratively updated through residual connections across layers by embedding
them into the feature channels. Since the relative position is exactly the
learning target for cross-view matching, an efficient hierarchical cross-view
decoder, MatchDecoder, is designed with MatchAttention as its core component.
To handle cross-view occlusions, gated cross-MatchAttention and a
consistency-constrained loss are proposed. These two components collectively
mitigate the impact of occlusions in both forward and backward passes, allowing
the model to focus more on learning matching relationships. When applied to
stereo matching, MatchStereo-B ranked 1st in average error on the public
Middlebury benchmark and requires only 29ms for KITTI-resolution inference.
MatchStereo-T can process 4K UHD images in 0.1 seconds using only 3GB of GPU
memory. The proposed models also achieve state-of-the-art performance on KITTI
2012, KITTI 2015, ETH3D, and Spring flow datasets. The combination of high
accuracy and low computational complexity makes real-time, high-resolution, and
high-accuracy cross-view matching possible. Code is available at

Motivation: Gaussian Splatting struggles with capturing fine details and maintaining realism in sparse regions due to limitations of sparse 3D training data, creating a need for enhanced reconstruction methods.

Method: Integrates 2D computer vision techniques including convex filtering and semantic feature supervision from foundational models like DINO, using 2D segmentation priors and high-dimensional feature embeddings to guide Gaussian splat densification and refinement.

Result: Consistently outperforms existing Gaussian Splatting across three datasets in the majority of evaluated scenes, demonstrating improved coverage in underrepresented areas and better preservation of structural details.

Conclusion: Hybrid 2D-3D approaches show significant potential, with thoughtful combination of 2D foundational models and 3D reconstruction pipelines overcoming limitations inherent in either approach alone.

Abstract: Scene reconstruction has emerged as a central challenge in computer vision,
with approaches such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting
achieving remarkable progress. While Gaussian Splatting demonstrates strong
performance on large-scale datasets, it often struggles to capture fine details
or maintain realism in regions with sparse coverage, largely due to the
inherent limitations of sparse 3D training data.
  In this work, we propose GauSSmart, a hybrid method that effectively bridges
2D foundational models and 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction. Our approach
integrates established 2D computer vision techniques, including convex
filtering and semantic feature supervision from foundational models such as
DINO, to enhance Gaussian-based scene reconstruction. By leveraging 2D
segmentation priors and high-dimensional feature embeddings, our method guides
the densification and refinement of Gaussian splats, improving coverage in
underrepresented areas and preserving intricate structural details.
  We validate our approach across three datasets, where GauSSmart consistently
outperforms existing Gaussian Splatting in the majority of evaluated scenes.
Our results demonstrate the significant potential of hybrid 2D-3D approaches,
highlighting how the thoughtful combination of 2D foundational models with 3D
reconstruction pipelines can overcome the limitations inherent in either
approach alone.

Conclusion: Causal inference shows strong potential as a powerful tool for addressing domain shift in histopathology image analysis, outperforming statistical correlation-based approaches.

Abstract: Domain shift in histopathology, often caused by differences in acquisition
processes or data sources, poses a major challenge to the generalization
ability of deep learning models. Existing methods primarily rely on modeling
statistical correlations by aligning feature distributions or introducing

work, we propose a novel causal-inference-based framework that leverages
semantic features while mitigating the impact of confounders. Our method
implements the front-door principle by designing transformation strategies that
explicitly incorporate mediators and observed tissue slides. We validate our
method on the CAMELYON17 dataset and a private histopathology dataset,
demonstrating consistent performance gains across unseen domains. As a result,
our approach achieved up to a 7% improvement in both the CAMELYON17 dataset and

TL;DR: Proposes a training-free tri-layer contrastive decoding with watermarking method to reduce hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models by selecting mature/amateur layers, identifying pivot layers via watermark questions, and applying contrastive decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs often suffer from hallucinations - relying too heavily on single modalities or memorizing training data without proper visual grounding, despite showing promising multimodal performance.

Method: Three-step approach: 1) Select mature and amateur layers among decoding layers, 2) Identify pivot layer using watermark-related questions to assess visual grounding, 3) Apply tri-layer contrastive decoding for final output generation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks (POPE, MME, AMBER) in reducing LVLM hallucinations and generates more visually grounded responses.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free tri-layer contrastive decoding with watermarking effectively mitigates hallucinations in LVLMs while maintaining visual grounding.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently shown promising results on
various multimodal tasks, even achieving human-comparable performance in
certain cases. Nevertheless, LVLMs remain prone to hallucinations -- they often
rely heavily on a single modality or memorize training data without properly
grounding their outputs. To address this, we propose a training-free, tri-layer
contrastive decoding with watermarking, which proceeds in three steps: (1)
select a mature layer and an amateur layer among the decoding layers, (2)
identify a pivot layer using a watermark-related question to assess whether the
layer is visually well-grounded, and (3) apply tri-layer contrastive decoding
to generate the final output. Experiments on public benchmarks such as POPE,
MME and AMBER demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
in reducing hallucinations in LVLMs and generates more visually grounded
responses.

TL;DR: MID-StyleGAN is a novel framework that combines diffusion models and GANs to generate synthetic ocular images for iris presentation attack detection, addressing data scarcity issues in biometric security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a scarcity of datasets for training and evaluating iris presentation attack detection (PAD) techniques due to difficulties in constructing and imaging presentation attacks (PAs) like artificial eyes, printed images, and cosmetic contact lenses.

Method: MID-StyleGAN combines diffusion models and GANs with a multi-domain architecture that enables translation between bonafide ocular images and different PA domains, using an adaptive loss function tailored for ocular data to maintain domain consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments show MID-StyleGAN outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality synthetic ocular images. On the LivDet2020 dataset, the true detect rate at 1% false detect rate improved from 93.41% to 98.72%.

Conclusion: MID-StyleGAN provides a scalable solution to data scarcity in iris biometrics by generating realistic synthetic data that significantly enhances PAD system performance.

Abstract: An iris biometric system can be compromised by presentation attacks (PAs)
where artifacts such as artificial eyes, printed eye images, or cosmetic
contact lenses are presented to the system. To counteract this, several
presentation attack detection (PAD) methods have been developed. However, there
is a scarcity of datasets for training and evaluating iris PAD techniques due
to the implicit difficulties in constructing and imaging PAs. To address this,
we introduce the Multi-domain Image Translative Diffusion StyleGAN
(MID-StyleGAN), a new framework for generating synthetic ocular images that
captures the PA and bonafide characteristics in multiple domains such as
bonafide, printed eyes and cosmetic contact lens. MID-StyleGAN combines the
strengths of diffusion models and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to
produce realistic and diverse synthetic data. Our approach utilizes a
multi-domain architecture that enables the translation between bonafide ocular
images and different PA domains. The model employs an adaptive loss function
tailored for ocular data to maintain domain consistency. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MID-StyleGAN outperforms existing methods in generating
high-quality synthetic ocular images. The generated data was used to
significantly enhance the performance of PAD systems, providing a scalable
solution to the data scarcity problem in iris and ocular biometrics. For
example, on the LivDet2020 dataset, the true detect rate at 1% false detect
rate improved from 93.41% to 98.72%, showcasing the impact of the proposed
method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mainstream MLLMs are supervised only by next-token prediction of textual tokens, neglecting critical vision-centric information essential for analytical abilities.

Method: Introduces VaCo with visual discriminative alignment, Modular Task Queries (MTQs), Visual Alignment Layers (VALs), and Token Gateway Mask (TGM) to coordinate multiple VFMs and restrict information flow.

Result: Extensive experiments show VaCo significantly improves performance of different MLLMs on various benchmarks, demonstrating superior visual comprehension capabilities.

Conclusion: VaCo successfully addresses the limitation of text-only supervision in MLLMs by incorporating vision-centric optimization from multiple VFMs, enhancing multimodal understanding.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) integrate image features from visual
encoders with LLMs, demonstrating advanced comprehension capabilities. However,
mainstream MLLMs are solely supervised by the next-token prediction of textual
tokens, neglecting critical vision-centric information essential for analytical
abilities. To track this dilemma, we introduce VaCo, which optimizes MLLM
representations through Vision-Centric activation and Coordination from
multiple vision foundation models (VFMs). VaCo introduces visual discriminative
alignment to integrate task-aware perceptual features extracted from VFMs,
thereby unifying the optimization of both textual and visual outputs in MLLMs.
Specifically, we incorporate the learnable Modular Task Queries (MTQs) and
Visual Alignment Layers (VALs) into MLLMs, activating specific visual signals
under the supervision of diverse VFMs. To coordinate representation conflicts
across VFMs, the crafted Token Gateway Mask (TGM) restricts the information
flow among multiple groups of MTQs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VaCo
significantly improves the performance of different MLLMs on various
benchmarks, showcasing its superior capabilities in visual comprehension.

Motivation: To leverage the abundance of unlabeled RGB-D data from consumer depth cameras for geometric scene reasoning, moving beyond traditional geometric and feature-based similarity approaches.

Method: Uses cycle-consistent keypoints for spatial coherence constraints and introduces a novel pose block combining GRU recurrent units with transformation synchronization to blend historical and multi-view data.

Result: Outperforms previous self-supervised registration methods on ScanNet and 3DMatch datasets, even surpassing some older supervised methods. The components also prove effective when integrated into existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates that cycle-consistent keypoints and the novel pose block with GRU and transformation synchronization significantly improve RGB-D registration performance in self-supervised settings.

Abstract: With the rise in consumer depth cameras, a wealth of unlabeled RGB-D data has
become available. This prompts the question of how to utilize this data for
geometric reasoning of scenes. While many RGB-D registration meth- ods rely on

cycle-consistent keypoints as salient points to enforce spatial coherence
constraints during matching, improving correspondence accuracy. Additionally,
we introduce a novel pose block that combines a GRU recurrent unit with

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPR (Spatial Preference Rewarding) enhances MLLMs' fine-grained spatial understanding by rewarding detailed responses with precise object localization over vague ones, using semantic and localization scores for optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs lack fine-grained spatial perception abilities like detailed region descriptions and accurate object localization, and often fail to meet user requirements for spatial understanding due to focusing on pre-annotated data without direct supervision of responses.

Method: SPR introduces semantic and localization scores to evaluate MLLM-generated descriptions, refines descriptions for better localization accuracy, and pairs best-scored refinements with lowest-scored initial descriptions for direct preference optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard referring and grounding benchmarks show that SPR effectively improves MLLM spatial understanding capabilities with minimal training overhead.

Conclusion: SPR successfully enhances MLLMs' fine-grained spatial capabilities by directly supervising and optimizing their responses through preference rewarding, achieving better alignment with visual input.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models~(MLLMs) have demonstrated promising spatial
understanding capabilities, such as referencing and grounding object
descriptions. Despite their successes, MLLMs still fall short in fine-grained
spatial perception abilities, such as generating detailed region descriptions
or accurately localizing objects. Additionally, they often fail to respond to
the user's requirements for desired fine-grained spatial understanding. This
issue might arise because existing approaches primarily focus on tuning MLLMs
to model pre-annotated instruction data to inject spatial knowledge, without
direct supervision of MLLMs' actual responses. We address this issue by SPR, a
Spatial Preference Rewarding~(SPR) approach that enhances MLLMs' spatial
capabilities by rewarding MLLMs' detailed responses with precise object
localization over vague or inaccurate responses. With randomly selected image
regions and region descriptions from MLLMs, SPR introduces semantic and
localization scores to comprehensively evaluate the text quality and
localization quality in MLLM-generated descriptions. We also refine the MLLM
descriptions with better localization accuracy and pair the best-scored
refinement with the initial descriptions of the lowest score for direct
preference optimization, thereby enhancing fine-grained alignment with visual
input. Extensive experiments over standard referring and grounding benchmarks
show that SPR improves MLLM spatial understanding capabilities effectively with
minimal overhead in training. Data and code will be released at

Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with prompts containing multiple objects, often resulting in object neglect or object mixing. The authors identified four problematic scenarios: Similar Shapes, Similar Textures, Dissimilar Background Biases, and Many Objects.

Method: Proposed DOS (Directional Object Separation) method that modifies three types of CLIP text embeddings before passing them into text-to-image models to better handle inter-object relationships.

Result: DOS consistently improved success rate of multi-object image generation and reduced object mixing. In human evaluations, DOS significantly outperformed four competing methods, receiving 26.24%-43.04% more votes across four benchmarks.

Conclusion: DOS is a practical and effective solution for improving multi-object image generation in text-to-image models.

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generative models has led to
significant improvements in generating high-quality images aligned with text
prompts. However, these models still struggle with prompts involving multiple
objects, often resulting in object neglect or object mixing. Through extensive
studies, we identify four problematic scenarios, Similar Shapes, Similar
Textures, Dissimilar Background Biases, and Many Objects, where inter-object
relationships frequently lead to such failures. Motivated by two key
observations about CLIP embeddings, we propose DOS (Directional Object
Separation), a method that modifies three types of CLIP text embeddings before
passing them into text-to-image models. Experimental results show that DOS
consistently improves the success rate of multi-object image generation and
reduces object mixing. In human evaluations, DOS significantly outperforms four
competing methods, receiving 26.24%-43.04% more votes across four benchmarks.
These results highlight DOS as a practical and effective solution for improving

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes DRBD-Mamba, an efficient 3D brain tumor segmentation model that addresses computational overhead in Mamba-based models through dual-resolution bidirectional processing and space-filling curves, achieving improved performance and 15x efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain tumor segmentation is challenging due to tumor heterogeneity. Mamba-based models show promise but suffer from high computational overhead from sequential feature computation and lack robustness evaluation across diverse data partitions.

Method: Uses dual-resolution bidirectional Mamba with space-filling curves for 3D-to-1D mapping to preserve spatial locality, gated fusion for context integration, quantization for robustness, and proposes systematic five-fold evaluation on BraTS2023.

Result: Achieves Dice improvements of 0.10% (whole tumor), 1.75% (tumor core), and 0.93% (enhancing tumor) on test set, with 15x efficiency improvement while maintaining high segmentation accuracy.

Conclusion: DRBD-Mamba provides an efficient and robust solution for brain tumor segmentation, demonstrating computational advantages and competitive performance across diverse evaluation scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation is significant for clinical diagnosis and
treatment. It is challenging due to the heterogeneity of tumor subregions.
Mamba-based State Space Models have demonstrated promising performance.
However, they incur significant computational overhead due to sequential
feature computation across multiple spatial axes. Moreover, their robustness
across diverse BraTS data partitions remains largely unexplored, leaving a
critical gap in reliable evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose
dual-resolution bi-directional Mamba (DRBD-Mamba), an efficient 3D segmentation
model that captures multi-scale long-range dependencies with minimal
computational overhead. We leverage a space-filling curve to preserve spatial
locality during 3D-to-1D feature mapping, thereby reducing reliance on
computationally expensive multi-axial feature scans. To enrich feature
representation, we propose a gated fusion module that adaptively integrates
forward and reverse contexts, along with a quantization block that discretizes
features to improve robustness. In addition, we propose five systematic folds
on BraTS2023 for rigorous evaluation of segmentation techniques under diverse
conditions and present detailed analysis of common failure scenarios. On the
20\% test set used by recent methods, our model achieves Dice improvements of
0.10\% for whole tumor, 1.75\% for tumor core, and 0.93\% for enhancing tumor.

TL;DR: BoardVision is a framework for detecting assembly-level motherboard defects using ensemble methods to balance precision and recall, with evaluation under realistic perturbations and a deployable GUI tool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assembly-level inspection of full motherboards is underexplored compared to bare-board or trace-level defects, despite being critical for reliability in high-volume electronics manufacturing.

Method: Benchmarks YOLOv7 and Faster R-CNN detectors, then proposes Confidence-Temporal Voting (CTV Voter) ensemble method to balance precision and recall. Evaluates robustness under perturbations like sharpness, brightness, and orientation changes.

Result: YOLOv7 excels in precision but underperforms in recall, while Faster R-CNN shows the reverse pattern. The CTV Voter ensemble effectively balances these metrics. Framework demonstrates stability challenges under realistic perturbations.

Conclusion: Computer vision techniques can successfully transition from benchmark results to practical quality assurance for assembly-level motherboard manufacturing, with the released GUI tool bridging research evaluation with operator usability.

Abstract: Motherboard defect detection is critical for ensuring reliability in
high-volume electronics manufacturing. While prior research in PCB inspection
has largely targeted bare-board or trace-level defects, assembly-level
inspection of full motherboards inspection remains underexplored. In this work,
we present BoardVision, a reproducible framework for detecting assembly-level
defects such as missing screws, loose fan wiring, and surface scratches. We
benchmark two representative detectors - YOLOv7 and Faster R-CNN, under
controlled conditions on the MiracleFactory motherboard dataset, providing the
first systematic comparison in this domain. To mitigate the limitations of
single models, where YOLO excels in precision but underperforms in recall and
Faster R-CNN shows the reverse, we propose a lightweight ensemble,
Confidence-Temporal Voting (CTV Voter), that balances precision and recall
through interpretable rules. We further evaluate robustness under realistic
perturbations including sharpness, brightness, and orientation changes,
highlighting stability challenges often overlooked in motherboard defect
detection. Finally, we release a deployable GUI-driven inspection tool that
bridges research evaluation with operator usability. Together, these
contributions demonstrate how computer vision techniques can transition from
benchmark results to practical quality assurance for assembly-level motherboard
manufacturing.

*Chao Tu,Kun Huang,Jie Zhang,Qianjin Feng,Yu Zhang,Zhenyuan Ning*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCMIL is a dual-curriculum contrastive multi-instance learning model that efficiently processes whole slide images for cancer prognosis without dense annotations, outperforming standard methods across 12 cancer types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progress in computational pathology is hindered by computational bottlenecks from gigapixel-size inputs and scarcity of dense manual annotations, with current methods overlooking fine-grained information across multi-magnification WSIs and tumor microenvironment variations.

Method: Proposed an easy-to-hard progressive representation learning model called DCMIL (dual-curriculum contrastive multi-instance learning) that transforms gigapixel-size WSIs directly into outcome predictions without relying on dense annotations.

Result: Extensive experiments on 12 cancer types (5,954 patients, 12.54 million tiles) show DCMIL outperforms standard WSI-based prognostic models, identifies fine-grained prognosis-salient regions, provides robust instance uncertainty estimation, and captures morphological differences between normal and tumor tissues.

Conclusion: DCMIL demonstrates superior performance for cancer prognosis from WSIs, has potential to generate new biological insights, and all codes have been made publicly available.

Abstract: The burgeoning discipline of computational pathology shows promise in
harnessing whole slide images (WSIs) to quantify morphological heterogeneity
and develop objective prognostic modes for human cancers. However, progress is
impeded by the computational bottleneck of gigapixel-size inputs and the
scarcity of dense manual annotations. Current methods often overlook
fine-grained information across multi-magnification WSIs and variations in
tumor microenvironments. Here, we propose an easy-to-hard progressive
representation learning model, termed dual-curriculum contrastive
multi-instance learning (DCMIL), to efficiently process WSIs for cancer
prognosis. The model does not rely on dense annotations and enables the direct
transformation of gigapixel-size WSIs into outcome predictions. Extensive
experiments on twelve cancer types (5,954 patients, 12.54 million tiles)
demonstrate that DCMIL outperforms standard WSI-based prognostic models.
Additionally, DCMIL identifies fine-grained prognosis-salient regions, provides
robust instance uncertainty estimation, and captures morphological differences
between normal and tumor tissues, with the potential to generate new biological
insights. All codes have been made publicly accessible at

### [31] [Real-Time Neural Video Compression with Unified Intra and Inter Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14431)
*Hui Xiang,Yifan Bian,Li Li,Jingran Wu,Xianguo Zhang,Dong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a neural video compression framework that integrates intra and inter coding in a unified model, addressing limitations of existing NVC schemes like disocclusion handling and error propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural video compression schemes have limitations in handling disocclusion, new content, and suffer from interframe error propagation. The authors aim to eliminate these issues by borrowing concepts from classic video coding.

Method: Proposes an NVC framework with unified intra and inter coding using a single model that adaptively performs both coding types. Introduces simultaneous two-frame compression to exploit both forward and backward interframe redundancy.

Result: The scheme outperforms DCVC-RT by an average of 10.7% BD-rate reduction, provides more stable bitrate and quality per frame, while maintaining real-time encoding/decoding performance.

Conclusion: The proposed unified intra/inter coding framework effectively addresses key limitations in neural video compression, achieving significant performance improvements while preserving real-time capabilities.

Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) technologies have advanced rapidly in recent
years, yielding state-of-the-art schemes such as DCVC-RT that offer superior
compression efficiency to H.266/VVC and real-time encoding/decoding
capabilities. Nonetheless, existing NVC schemes have several limitations,
including inefficiency in dealing with disocclusion and new content, interframe
error propagation and accumulation, among others. To eliminate these
limitations, we borrow the idea from classic video coding schemes, which allow
intra coding within inter-coded frames. With the intra coding tool enabled,
disocclusion and new content are properly handled, and interframe error
propagation is naturally intercepted without the need for manual refresh
mechanisms. We present an NVC framework with unified intra and inter coding,
where every frame is processed by a single model that is trained to perform
intra/inter coding adaptively. Moreover, we propose a simultaneous two-frame
compression design to exploit interframe redundancy not only forwardly but also
backwardly. Experimental results show that our scheme outperforms DCVC-RT by an
average of 10.7\% BD-rate reduction, delivers more stable bitrate and quality
per frame, and retains real-time encoding/decoding performances. Code and
models will be released.

TL;DR: A minimally distorted universal adversarial attack for video object detection using nuclear norm regularization and adaptive optimistic exponentiated gradient optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video-based object detection is crucial for safety-critical applications, but deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially universal perturbations.

Method: Uses nuclear norm regularization to create structured perturbations concentrated in background, optimized with adaptive optimistic exponentiated gradient method for scalability and convergence.

Result: Outperforms low-rank projected gradient descent and Frank-Wolfe based attacks in effectiveness while maintaining high stealthiness.

Conclusion: Proposed attack method successfully creates effective and stealthy universal adversarial perturbations for video object detection systems.

Abstract: Video-based object detection plays a vital role in safety-critical
applications. While deep learning-based object detectors have achieved
impressive performance, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly those involving universal perturbations. In this work, we propose
a minimally distorted universal adversarial attack tailored for video object
detection, which leverages nuclear norm regularization to promote structured
perturbations concentrated in the background. To optimize this formulation
efficiently, we employ an adaptive, optimistic exponentiated gradient method
that enhances both scalability and convergence. Our results demonstrate that
the proposed attack outperforms both low-rank projected gradient descent and
Frank-Wolfe based attacks in effectiveness while maintaining high stealthiness.

*Youwan Mahé,Elise Bannier,Stéphanie Leplaideur,Elisa Fromont,Francesca Galassi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This scoping review synthesizes recent work on unsupervised deep generative models for anomaly detection in neuroimaging, covering autoencoders, VAEs, GANs, and diffusion models applied to brain MRI/CT across various pathologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised deep generative models offer a promising alternative to supervised methods by requiring only healthy data for training and identifying anomalies as deviations from learned normative brain structures, overcoming limitations of supervised approaches that need large annotated datasets.

Method: PRISMA-guided scoping review of 49 studies (2018-2025) covering unsupervised deep generative models including autoencoders, variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and denoising diffusion models for brain MRI and CT anomaly detection.

Result: Generative models achieved encouraging performance for large focal lesions and demonstrated progress in detecting subtle abnormalities. A key strength is their ability to produce interpretable pseudo-healthy reconstructions, valuable when annotated data are scarce.

Conclusion: These models offer a compelling direction for anomaly detection, enabling semi-supervised learning, supporting novel biomarker discovery, and facilitating deviation mapping. Future work should prioritize anatomy-aware modeling, foundation models, appropriate evaluation metrics, and clinical validation.

Abstract: Unsupervised deep generative models are emerging as a promising alternative
to supervised methods for detecting and segmenting anomalies in brain imaging.
Unlike fully supervised approaches, which require large voxel-level annotated
datasets and are limited to well-characterised pathologies, these models can be
trained exclusively on healthy data and identify anomalies as deviations from
learned normative brain structures. This PRISMA-guided scoping review
synthesises recent work on unsupervised deep generative models for anomaly
detection in neuroimaging, including autoencoders, variational autoencoders,
generative adversarial networks, and denoising diffusion models. A total of 49
studies published between 2018 - 2025 were identified, covering applications to
brain MRI and, less frequently, CT across diverse pathologies such as tumours,
stroke, multiple sclerosis, and small vessel disease. Reported performance
metrics are compared alongside architectural design choices. Across the
included studies, generative models achieved encouraging performance for large
focal lesions and demonstrated progress in addressing more subtle
abnormalities. A key strength of generative models is their ability to produce
interpretable pseudo-healthy (also referred to as counterfactual)
reconstructions, which is particularly valuable when annotated data are scarce,
as in rare or heterogeneous diseases. Looking ahead, these models offer a
compelling direction for anomaly detection, enabling semi-supervised learning,
supporting the discovery of novel imaging biomarkers, and facilitating within-
and cross-disease deviation mapping in unified end-to-end frameworks. To
realise clinical impact, future work should prioritise anatomy-aware modelling,
development of foundation models, task-appropriate evaluation metrics, and
rigorous clinical validation.

### [34] [Pruning Overparameterized Multi-Task Networks for Degraded Web Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14463)
*Thomas Katraouras,Dimitrios Rafailidis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MIR-L, a compression strategy for multi-task image restoration models using iterative pruning to find sparse subnetworks that maintain performance with only 10% of parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-task image restoration models have high computational costs due to excessive parameters, making them inefficient for practical applications despite their ability to handle multiple degradation types.

Method: Uses iterative pruning strategy that removes low-magnitude weights across multiple rounds while resetting remaining weights to original initialization, discovering sparse 'winning tickets' within overparameterized models.

Result: Experimental evaluation on deraining, dehazing, and denoising tasks shows MIR-L retains only 10% of trainable parameters while maintaining high image restoration performance comparable to dense models.

Conclusion: The proposed iterative pruning approach effectively compresses multi-task image restoration models, achieving state-of-the-art performance at high sparsity levels with significant parameter reduction.

Abstract: Image quality is a critical factor in delivering visually appealing content
on web platforms. However, images often suffer from degradation due to lossy
operations applied by online social networks (OSNs), negatively affecting user
experience. Image restoration is the process of recovering a clean high-quality
image from a given degraded input. Recently, multi-task (all-in-one) image
restoration models have gained significant attention, due to their ability to
simultaneously handle different types of image degradations. However, these
models often come with an excessively high number of trainable parameters,
making them computationally inefficient. In this paper, we propose a strategy
for compressing multi-task image restoration models. We aim to discover highly
sparse subnetworks within overparameterized deep models that can match or even
surpass the performance of their dense counterparts. The proposed model, namely
MIR-L, utilizes an iterative pruning strategy that removes low-magnitude
weights across multiple rounds, while resetting the remaining weights to their
original initialization. This iterative process is important for the multi-task
image restoration model's optimization, effectively uncovering "winning
tickets" that maintain or exceed state-of-the-art performance at high sparsity
levels. Experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets for the deraining,
dehazing, and denoising tasks shows that MIR-L retains only 10% of the
trainable parameters while maintaining high image restoration performance. Our
code, datasets and pre-trained models are made publicly available at

*Aleksis Pirinen,Delia Fano Yela,Smita Chakraborty,Erik Källman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a CNN-LSTM ensemble model that uses Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to detect grazing activity in agricultural fields with 77% F1 score, enabling more efficient conservation compliance inspections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Grazing monitoring is crucial for both agricultural production and biodiversity conservation, but scalable monitoring methods are limited. Current inspection methods are resource-intensive and inefficient.

Method: Used Sentinel-2 L2A time series data (April-October) with polygon-defined field boundaries. Trained an ensemble of CNN-LSTM models on multi-temporal reflectance features for binary classification (grazed/not grazed).

Result: Achieved 77% average F1 score across five validation splits, with 90% recall on grazed pastures. When prioritizing predicted non-grazed fields, inspectors found 17.2 times more confirmed non-grazing sites than random inspection with only 4% site visits.

Conclusion: Freely available satellite data can reliably guide inspection resources for conservation compliance, significantly improving efficiency of land-use monitoring.

Abstract: Grazing shapes both agricultural production and biodiversity, yet scalable
monitoring of where grazing occurs remains limited. We study seasonal grazing
detection from Sentinel-2 L2A time series: for each polygon-defined field
boundary, April-October imagery is used for binary prediction (grazed / not
grazed). We train an ensemble of CNN-LSTM models on multi-temporal reflectance
features, and achieve an average F1 score of 77 percent across five validation
splits, with 90 percent recall on grazed pastures. Operationally, if inspectors
can visit at most 4 percent of sites annually, prioritising fields predicted by
our model as non-grazed yields 17.2 times more confirmed non-grazing sites than
random inspection. These results indicate that coarse-resolution, freely
available satellite data can reliably steer inspection resources for
conservation-aligned land-use compliance. Code and models have been made
publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Mamba is introduced as a backbone for 3D porous media permeability prediction, showing linear scaling with image resolution vs ViT's quadratic scaling, requiring fewer parameters than CNNs, and demonstrating practical advantages in computational/memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Mamba offers computational advantages over Vision Transformers (linear vs quadratic scaling with resolution) and parameter efficiency over CNNs, making it suitable for 3D porous media permeability prediction where efficiency is crucial.

Method: Used Vision Mamba as backbone for permeability prediction, compared performance with ViT and CNN models, conducted ablation study to assess component effects on accuracy.

Result: Demonstrated practical advantages of Vision Mamba over ViTs and CNNs in 3D porous media permeability prediction, showing better computational and memory efficiency.

Conclusion: Vision Mamba has potential to be integrated into large vision models as an alternative to ViTs, with source code made available for reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: Vision Mamba has recently received attention as an alternative to Vision
Transformers (ViTs) for image classification. The network size of Vision Mamba
scales linearly with input image resolution, whereas ViTs scale quadratically,
a feature that improves computational and memory efficiency. Moreover, Vision
Mamba requires a significantly smaller number of trainable parameters than
traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and thus, they can be more
memory efficient. Because of these features, we introduce, for the first time,
a neural network that uses Vision Mamba as its backbone for predicting the
permeability of three-dimensional porous media. We compare the performance of
Vision Mamba with ViT and CNN models across multiple aspects of permeability
prediction and perform an ablation study to assess the effects of its
components on accuracy. We demonstrate in practice the aforementioned
advantages of Vision Mamba over ViTs and CNNs in the permeability prediction of
three-dimensional porous media. We make the source code publicly available to
facilitate reproducibility and to enable other researchers to build on and
extend this work. We believe the proposed framework has the potential to be
integrated into large vision models in which Vision Mamba is used instead of
ViTs.

### [38] [Noise Projection: Closing the Prompt-Agnostic Gap Behind Text-to-Image Misalignment in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14526)
*Yunze Tong,Didi Zhu,Zijing Hu,Jinluan Yang,Ziyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a noise projector that refines initial noise in text-to-image generation to improve text-image alignment by addressing training-inference mismatch, without modifying the Stable Diffusion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for text-to-image generation suffer from misalignment between generated images and prompts due to training-inference mismatch - during training, noises are prompt-specific while inference uses prompt-agnostic Gaussian noise.

Method: Proposes a noise projector that maps initial noise to prompt-aware counterparts using text-conditioned refinement. The framework samples noises, obtains token-level feedback from a VLM, distills signals into a reward model, and optimizes the projector via quasi-direct preference optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments show that prompt-aware noise projection improves text-image alignment across diverse prompts, with small inference cost compared to multi-sample selection methods.

Conclusion: The proposed noise projector effectively addresses training-inference mismatch in text-to-image generation, enhancing alignment without model modifications and with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: In text-to-image generation, different initial noises induce distinct
denoising paths with a pretrained Stable Diffusion (SD) model. While this
pattern could output diverse images, some of them may fail to align well with
the prompt. Existing methods alleviate this issue either by altering the
denoising dynamics or by drawing multiple noises and conducting post-selection.
In this paper, we attribute the misalignment to a training-inference mismatch:
during training, prompt-conditioned noises lie in a prompt-specific subset of
the latent space, whereas at inference the noise is drawn from a
prompt-agnostic Gaussian prior. To close this gap, we propose a noise projector
that applies text-conditioned refinement to the initial noise before denoising.
Conditioned on the prompt embedding, it maps the noise to a prompt-aware
counterpart that better matches the distribution observed during SD training,
without modifying the SD model. Our framework consists of these steps: we first
sample some noises and obtain token-level feedback for their corresponding
images from a vision-language model (VLM), then distill these signals into a
reward model, and finally optimize the noise projector via a quasi-direct
preference optimization. Our design has two benefits: (i) it requires no
reference images or handcrafted priors, and (ii) it incurs small inference
cost, replacing multi-sample selection with a single forward pass. Extensive
experiments further show that our prompt-aware noise projection improves
text-image alignment across diverse prompts.

*Keima Abe,Hayato Muraki,Shuhei Tomoshige,Kenichi Oishi,Hitoshi Iyatomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PL-SE-ADA is a domain harmonization framework for brain MR images that uses pseudo-linear style encoding with adversarial training to disentangle domain-invariant and domain-specific features while maintaining interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical images show domain shifts across imaging sites that degrade ML performance. Existing domain harmonization methods lack interpretability, which is essential for medical applications.

Method: Uses two encoders to extract domain-invariant (z_u) and domain-specific (z_d) features, a decoder for reconstruction, and a domain predictor. Employs adversarial training and reconstructs input by summing reconstructions from z_u and z_d components.

Result: Achieves equal or better performance than prior methods in image reconstruction, disease classification, and domain recognition. Enables visualization of both domain-independent brain features and domain-specific components.

Conclusion: PL-SE-ADA provides an interpretable domain harmonization framework that preserves disease-relevant information while offering high interpretability across the entire system.

Abstract: Medical images like MR scans often show domain shifts across imaging sites
due to scanner and protocol differences, which degrade machine learning
performance in tasks such as disease classification. Domain harmonization is
thus a critical research focus. Recent approaches encode brain images
$\boldsymbol{x}$ into a low-dimensional latent space $\boldsymbol{z}$, then
disentangle it into $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ (domain-invariant) and
$\boldsymbol{z_d}$ (domain-specific), achieving strong results. However, these
methods often lack interpretability$-$an essential requirement in medical
applications$-$leaving practical issues unresolved. We propose
Pseudo-Linear-Style Encoder Adversarial Domain Adaptation (PL-SE-ADA), a
general framework for domain harmonization and interpretable representation
learning that preserves disease-relevant information in brain MR images.
PL-SE-ADA includes two encoders $f_E$ and $f_{SE}$ to extract
$\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and $\boldsymbol{z_d}$, a decoder to reconstruct the image
$f_D$, and a domain predictor $g_D$. Beyond adversarial training between the
encoder and domain predictor, the model learns to reconstruct the input image
$\boldsymbol{x}$ by summing reconstructions from $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and
$\boldsymbol{z_d}$, ensuring both harmonization and informativeness. Compared
to prior methods, PL-SE-ADA achieves equal or better performance in image
reconstruction, disease classification, and domain recognition. It also enables
visualization of both domain-independent brain features and domain-specific
components, offering high interpretability across the entire framework.

Abstract: Spatial perception and reasoning are crucial for Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models to accomplish fine-grained manipulation tasks. However, existing
approaches often lack the ability to understand and reason over the essential
3D structures necessary for precise control. To address this limitation, we
propose QDepth-VLA, a general framework that augments VLA models with an
auxiliary depth prediction task. A dedicated depth expert is designed to
predict quantized latent tokens of depth maps obtained from a VQ-VAE encoder,
enabling the model to learn depth-aware representations that capture critical
geometric cues. Experimental results on the simulation benchmarks and
real-world tasks demonstrate that QDepth-VLA yields strong spatial reasoning
and competitive performance on manipulation tasks.

### [43] [Exploring Image Representation with Decoupled Classical Visual Descriptors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14536)
*Chenyuan Qu,Hao Chen,Jianbo Jiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisualSplit is a framework that decomposes images into classical visual descriptors (edge, color, intensity) and uses reconstruction-driven pre-training to learn interpretable representations that enable effective attribute control in visual tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning representations are opaque and hard to interpret, while classical visual descriptors remain intuitively understandable. The paper explores whether modern learning can benefit from these classical cues.

Method: VisualSplit explicitly decomposes images into decoupled classical descriptors, treating each as independent but complementary components. Uses reconstruction-driven pre-training to capture the essence of each descriptor while preserving interpretability.

Result: The method facilitates effective attribute control in various advanced visual tasks including image generation and editing, extending beyond conventional classification and segmentation.

Conclusion: The explicit decomposition of visual attributes through VisualSplit suggests effectiveness of this new learning approach for visual understanding, bridging the gap between modern deep learning and classical interpretable representations.

Abstract: Exploring and understanding efficient image representations is a
long-standing challenge in computer vision. While deep learning has achieved
remarkable progress across image understanding tasks, its internal
representations are often opaque, making it difficult to interpret how visual
information is processed. In contrast, classical visual descriptors (e.g. edge,
colour, and intensity distribution) have long been fundamental to image
analysis and remain intuitively understandable to humans. Motivated by this
gap, we ask a central question: Can modern learning benefit from these
classical cues? In this paper, we answer it with VisualSplit, a framework that
explicitly decomposes images into decoupled classical descriptors, treating
each as an independent but complementary component of visual knowledge. Through
a reconstruction-driven pre-training scheme, VisualSplit learns to capture the
essence of each visual descriptor while preserving their interpretability. By
explicitly decomposing visual attributes, our method inherently facilitates
effective attribute control in various advanced visual tasks, including image
generation and editing, extending beyond conventional classification and
segmentation, suggesting the effectiveness of this new learning approach for
visual understanding. Project page: https://chenyuanqu.com/VisualSplit/.

### [44] [Ponimator: Unfolding Interactive Pose for Versatile Human-human Interaction Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14976)
*Shaowei Liu,Chuan Guo,Bing Zhou,Jian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ponimator is a framework that uses close-proximity human-human interactive poses to generate versatile interaction animations through two conditional diffusion models: one for motion generation from poses, and another for pose synthesis from single poses or text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans can intuitively infer interaction context and dynamics from close-proximity poses, drawing on strong behavioral priors. This inspired leveraging interactive pose priors for animation.

Method: Uses two conditional diffusion models: (1) pose animator that generates motion sequences from interactive poses using temporal priors, and (2) pose generator that synthesizes interactive poses from single poses, text, or both using spatial priors.

Result: Empirical experiments demonstrate universality of pose priors and effectiveness/robustness across diverse datasets and applications including image-based interaction animation, reaction animation, and text-to-interaction synthesis.

Conclusion: Ponimator successfully transfers interaction knowledge from high-quality mocap data to open-world scenarios, supporting diverse animation tasks through interactive pose priors.

Abstract: Close-proximity human-human interactive poses convey rich contextual
information about interaction dynamics. Given such poses, humans can
intuitively infer the context and anticipate possible past and future dynamics,
drawing on strong priors of human behavior. Inspired by this observation, we
propose Ponimator, a simple framework anchored on proximal interactive poses
for versatile interaction animation. Our training data consists of
close-contact two-person poses and their surrounding temporal context from
motion-capture interaction datasets. Leveraging interactive pose priors,
Ponimator employs two conditional diffusion models: (1) a pose animator that
uses the temporal prior to generate dynamic motion sequences from interactive
poses, and (2) a pose generator that applies the spatial prior to synthesize
interactive poses from a single pose, text, or both when interactive poses are
unavailable. Collectively, Ponimator supports diverse tasks, including
image-based interaction animation, reaction animation, and text-to-interaction
synthesis, facilitating the transfer of interaction knowledge from high-quality
mocap data to open-world scenarios. Empirical experiments across diverse
datasets and applications demonstrate the universality of the pose prior and
the effectiveness and robustness of our framework.

### [45] [Exploring Cross-Modal Flows for Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14543)
*Ziqi Jiang,Yanghao Wang,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMA proposes a multi-step cross-modal alignment approach using flow matching to address limitations of one-step PEFT methods for complex datasets where modalities are highly entangled.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods perform one-step adjustment which is insufficient for complex datasets where features from different modalities are highly entangled.

Method: Learn a cross-modal velocity field through Flow Matching Alignment (FMA) using fixed coupling strategy for category correspondence, noise augmentation for data scarcity, and early-stopping solver for efficiency.

Result: FMA consistently yields significant performance gains across various benchmarks and backbones, particularly on challenging datasets, demonstrating superior multi-step rectification ability.

Conclusion: Multi-step adjustment through flow matching provides more precise and robust cross-modal alignment compared to one-step PEFT methods, especially for complex datasets.

Abstract: Aligning features from different modalities, is one of the most fundamental
challenges for cross-modal tasks. Although pre-trained vision-language models
can achieve a general alignment between image and text, they often require
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for further adjustment. Today's PEFT
methods (e.g., prompt tuning, LoRA-based, or adapter-based) always selectively
fine-tune a subset of parameters, which can slightly adjust either visual or
textual features, and avoid overfitting. In this paper, we are the first to
highlight that all existing PEFT methods perform one-step adjustment. It is
insufficient for complex (or difficult) datasets, where features of different
modalities are highly entangled. To this end, we propose the first
model-agnostic multi-step adjustment approach by learning a cross-modal
velocity field: Flow Matching Alignment (FMA). Specifically, to ensure the
correspondence between categories during training, we first utilize a fixed
coupling strategy. Then, we propose a noise augmentation strategy to alleviate
the data scarcity issue. Finally, we design an early-stopping solver, which
terminates the transformation process earlier, improving both efficiency and
accuracy. Compared with one-step PEFT methods, FMA has the multi-step
rectification ability to achieve more precise and robust alignment. Extensive
results have demonstrated that FMA can consistently yield significant
performance gains across various benchmarks and backbones, particularly on
challenging datasets.

### [46] [Consistent text-to-image generation via scene de-contextualization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14553)
*Song Tang,Peihao Gong,Kunyu Li,Kai Guo,Boyu Wang,Mao Ye,Jianwei Zhang,Xiatian Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Scene De-Contextualization (SDeC), a training-free prompt embedding editing method that addresses identity shift in text-to-image generation by suppressing the natural correlation between subject and scene context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2I generation methods suffer from identity shift when generating the same subject across different scenes, and existing solutions unrealistically assume prior knowledge of all target scenes.

Method: SDeC identifies and suppresses latent scene-ID correlation in prompt embeddings by quantifying SVD directional stability to adaptively re-weight eigenvalues, implementing an inversion of T2I's built-in scene contextualization.

Result: Experiments show SDeC significantly enhances identity preservation while maintaining scene diversity, working effectively with per-scene use without requiring prior access to all target scenes.

Conclusion: SDeC provides a flexible, general solution for real-world T2I applications where prior scene knowledge is unavailable or varies, effectively addressing the fundamental issue of scene contextualization.

Abstract: Consistent text-to-image (T2I) generation seeks to produce
identity-preserving images of the same subject across diverse scenes, yet it
often fails due to a phenomenon called identity (ID) shift. Previous methods
have tackled this issue, but typically rely on the unrealistic assumption of
knowing all target scenes in advance. This paper reveals that a key source of
ID shift is the native correlation between subject and scene context, called
scene contextualization, which arises naturally as T2I models fit the training
distribution of vast natural images. We formally prove the near-universality of
this scene-ID correlation and derive theoretical bounds on its strength. On
this basis, we propose a novel, efficient, training-free prompt embedding
editing approach, called Scene De-Contextualization (SDeC), that imposes an
inversion process of T2I's built-in scene contextualization. Specifically, it
identifies and suppresses the latent scene-ID correlation within the ID
prompt's embedding by quantifying the SVD directional stability to adaptively
re-weight the corresponding eigenvalues. Critically, SDeC allows for per-scene
use (one scene per prompt) without requiring prior access to all target scenes.
This makes it a highly flexible and general solution well-suited to real-world
applications where such prior knowledge is often unavailable or varies over
time. Experiments demonstrate that SDeC significantly enhances identity
preservation while maintaining scene diversity.

Conclusion: The work presents a successful approach for building AI assistants that can proactively interact with streaming video environments, demonstrating improved performance over existing methods through the proposed benchmark and technical pipeline.

Abstract: Envision an AI capable of functioning in human-like settings, moving beyond

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BalanceGS is an algorithm-system co-design that optimizes 3D Gaussian Splatting training by addressing inefficiencies in density allocation, computation workload, and memory access, achieving 1.44× speedup with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3DGS suffers from three critical inefficiencies: skewed density allocation during Gaussian densification, imbalanced computation workload during Gaussian projection, and fragmented memory access during color splatting.

Method: 1) Heuristic workload-sensitive Gaussian density control to balance point distributions; 2) Similarity-based Gaussian sampling and merging for adaptive workload distribution; 3) Reordering-based memory access mapping strategy for efficient RGB storage.

Result: Achieves 1.44× training speedup on NVIDIA A100 GPU with negligible quality degradation compared to standard 3DGS.

Conclusion: BalanceGS successfully addresses the key inefficiencies in 3DGS training through algorithm-system co-design, significantly improving training efficiency while maintaining reconstruction quality.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising 3D reconstruction
technique. The traditional 3DGS training pipeline follows three sequential
steps: Gaussian densification, Gaussian projection, and color splatting.
Despite its promising reconstruction quality, this conventional approach
suffers from three critical inefficiencies: (1) Skewed density allocation
during Gaussian densification, (2) Imbalanced computation workload during
Gaussian projection and (3) Fragmented memory access during color splatting.
  To tackle the above challenges, we introduce BalanceGS, the algorithm-system
co-design for efficient training in 3DGS. (1) At the algorithm level, we
propose heuristic workload-sensitive Gaussian density control to automatically
balance point distributions - removing 80% redundant Gaussians in dense regions
while filling gaps in sparse areas. (2) At the system level, we propose
Similarity-based Gaussian sampling and merging, which replaces the static
one-to-one thread-pixel mapping with adaptive workload distribution - threads
now dynamically process variable numbers of Gaussians based on local cluster
density. (3) At the mapping level, we propose reordering-based memory access
mapping strategy that restructures RGB storage and enables batch loading in
shared memory.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with 3DGS, our approach
achieves a 1.44$\times$ training speedup on a NVIDIA A100 GPU with negligible
quality degradation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of learning discriminative features from 3D point clouds to distinguish between vehicles in re-identification tasks.

Method: Multi-branch architecture combining edge convolution, point attention, and curvature embedding to characterize local surface variation in point clouds.

Result: Achieves mean re-identification accuracy improvement of 1.97% points over strongest baseline on nuScenes dataset.

Conclusion: Curvature information integration and multi-branch feature learning are effective for LiDAR point cloud-based vehicle re-identification.

Abstract: This paper presents CALM-Net, a curvature-aware LiDAR point cloud-based
multi-branch neural network for vehicle re-identification. The proposed model
addresses the challenge of learning discriminative and complementary features
from three-dimensional point clouds to distinguish between vehicles. CALM-Net
employs a multi-branch architecture that integrates edge convolution, point
attention, and a curvature embedding that characterizes local surface variation
in point clouds. By combining these mechanisms, the model learns richer
geometric and contextual features that are well suited for the
re-identification task. Experimental evaluation on the large-scale nuScenes
dataset demonstrates that CALM-Net achieves a mean re-identification accuracy
improvement of approximately 1.97\% points compared with the strongest baseline
in our study. The results confirms the effectiveness of incorporating curvature
information into deep learning architectures and highlight the benefit of
multi-branch feature learning for LiDAR point cloud-based vehicle
re-identification.

*Matan Rusanovsky,Shimon Malnick,Shai Avidan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for pixel-level keypoint grounding that generates contextual descriptions of keypoints and localizes them from text, trained on a new 20K+ dataset and achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models lack pixel-precise keypoint understanding through natural language, being limited to object-level or region-level grounding.

Method: Two-component framework: Point Descriptor generates free-form contextual descriptions of keypoints, and Point Localizer regresses pixel coordinates from descriptions. Trained on LlamaPointInPart dataset (20K+ triplets) using GRPO optimization with frozen Point Localizer as reward model.

Result: Superior performance compared to baseline models on LlamaPointInPart dataset, with a new evaluation protocol that measures localization accuracy rather than text similarity.

Conclusion: The bidirectional framework enables both keypoint-guided image understanding and language-guided precise localization, with potential for future applications.

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in cross-modal
understanding. Yet, these models remain limited to object-level or region-level
grounding, lacking the capability for pixel-precise keypoint comprehension
through natural language. We introduce a novel framework for pixel level
grounding. The framework consists of two complementary components: a Point
Descriptor that generates rich, contextual descriptions of individual
keypoints, and a Point Localizer that regresses precise pixel coordinates from
these descriptions. Unlike prior work that relies on templated prompts or
keypoint names, our approach produces free-form, coarse-to-fine descriptions
that situate keypoints within their visual context. Since there is no available
dataset to train such a system, we introduce LlamaPointInPart, a carefully
curated dataset of 20K+ image-keypoint-description triplets synthesized from
multiple vision-language models, capturing multi-scale information from
scene-level context to visual features around the keypoint. For cross-category
generalization, we optimize the Point Descriptor on AP-10K via GRPO, using the
frozen Point Localizer as a reward model to produce descriptions that maximize
localization accuracy. To evaluate our results we establish a new evaluation
protocol. Instead of comparing the text description produced by our method to
the ground truth, we use the localizer to determine how close is the predicted
point generated to the ground truth point. Experiments demonstrate superior
performance compared to baseline models on LlamaPointInPart.The bidirectional
nature of our framework should enable future applications in both
keypoint-guided image understanding and language-guided precise localization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STANCE is an image-to-video framework that improves object motion coherence using Instance Cues for dense 2.5D motion guidance and Dense RoPE to preserve motion token salience, with joint RGB+auxiliary-map prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation struggles with coherent object motion and interactions due to sparse motion hints collapsing to few tokens and appearance-motion optimization favoring texture over temporal consistency.

Method: Uses Instance Cues to convert sparse user hints into dense 2.5D motion fields via instance flow averaging and monocular depth, plus Dense RoPE to tag motion tokens with spatial embeddings, and joint RGB+auxiliary-map prediction.

Result: Reduces depth ambiguity compared to 2D arrow inputs, stabilizes optimization, and improves temporal coherence without requiring per-frame trajectory scripts.

Conclusion: STANCE effectively addresses motion coherence bottlenecks through dense motion guidance and token preservation techniques, enabling better object motion and interactions in video generation.

Abstract: Video generation has recently made striking visual progress, but maintaining
coherent object motion and interactions remains difficult. We trace two
practical bottlenecks: (i) human-provided motion hints (e.g., small 2D maps)
often collapse to too few effective tokens after encoding, weakening guidance;
and (ii) optimizing for appearance and motion in a single head can favor
texture over temporal consistency. We present STANCE, an image-to-video
framework that addresses both issues with two simple components. First, we
introduce Instance Cues -- a pixel-aligned control signal that turns sparse,
user-editable hints into a dense 2.5D (camera-relative) motion field by
averaging per-instance flow and augmenting with monocular depth over the
instance mask. This reduces depth ambiguity compared to 2D arrow inputs while
remaining easy to use. Second, we preserve the salience of these cues in token
space with Dense RoPE, which tags a small set of motion tokens (anchored on the
first frame) with spatial-addressable rotary embeddings. Paired with joint RGB
\(+\) auxiliary-map prediction (segmentation or depth), our model anchors
structure while RGB handles appearance, stabilizing optimization and improving
temporal coherence without requiring per-frame trajectory scripts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG methods struggle with multimodal query quality and relevance of retrieved knowledge in KB-VQA tasks.

Method: Three-stage approach: Processing (visual tools for multimodal info extraction), Retrieval (visual-text feature integration), Filtering (relevance filtering). Uses RL-trained VLM with answer accuracy and format consistency rewards.

Result: Achieves significant improvements of 36.0 and 42.8 on E-VQA and InfoSeek datasets, setting new state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Wiki-PRF effectively addresses multimodal query quality and retrieval relevance issues in KB-VQA through its three-stage framework and RL-enhanced VLM training.

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires visual language
models (VLMs) to integrate visual understanding with external knowledge
retrieval. Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) achieves significant
advances in this task by combining knowledge-base querying, it still struggles
with the quality of multimodal queries and the relevance of retrieved results.
To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel three-stage method, termed
Wiki-PRF, including Processing, Retrieval and Filtering stages. The processing
stage dynamically invokes visual tools to extract precise multimodal
information for retrieval. The retrieval stage integrates visual and text
features to achieve multimodal knowledge retrieval. The filtering stage
performs relevance filtering and concentration on retrieval results. To this
end, we introduce a visual language model trained with answer accuracy and
format consistency as reward signals via a reinforcement learning manner. This
enhances the model's reasoning, tool invocation for accurate queries, and
filtering of irrelevant content. Experiments on benchmark datasets (E-VQA and
InfoSeek) show significant improvements~(36.0 and 42.8) in answer quality,
achieving state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at

TL;DR: Shot2Tactic-Caption is a dual-branch framework for badminton video captioning that generates both shot-level descriptions of individual actions and tactic-level descriptions of how tactics unfold over time, using a novel shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tactical understanding in badminton requires interpreting both individual actions and how tactics are dynamically executed over time, which existing methods don't adequately address.

Method: Dual-branch design with visual encoder, spatio-temporal Transformer encoder, and Transformer decoder for both shot and tactic captions. Includes Tactic Unit Detector and shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism using predicted tactic type and state as prompts injected via cross-attention.

Result: Framework effectively generates both shot and tactic captions. ResNet50-based spatio-temporal encoder outperforms other variants, and shot-wise prompt structuring produces more coherent and accurate tactic captioning. Dataset contains 5,494 shot captions and 544 tactic captions.

Conclusion: The proposed Shot2Tactic-Caption framework successfully addresses multi-scale video captioning in badminton, enabling description of both individual actions and tactical executions over time, including interrupted and resumed tactics.

Abstract: Tactical understanding in badminton involves interpreting not only individual
actions but also how tactics are dynamically executed over time. In this paper,
we propose \textbf{Shot2Tactic-Caption}, a novel framework for semantic and
temporal multi-scale video captioning in badminton, capable of generating
shot-level captions that describe individual actions and tactic-level captions
that capture how these actions unfold over time within a tactical execution. We
also introduce the Shot2Tactic-Caption Dataset, the first badminton captioning
dataset containing 5,494 shot captions and 544 tactic captions.
Shot2Tactic-Caption adopts a dual-branch design, with both branches including a
visual encoder, a spatio-temporal Transformer encoder, and a Transformer-based
decoder to generate shot and tactic captions. To support tactic captioning, we
additionally introduce a Tactic Unit Detector that identifies valid tactic
units, tactic types, and tactic states (e.g., Interrupt, Resume). For tactic
captioning, we further incorporate a shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism, where
the predicted tactic type and state are embedded as prompts and injected into
the decoder via cross-attention. The shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism enables
our system not only to describe successfully executed tactics but also to
capture tactical executions that are temporarily interrupted and later resumed.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in
generating both shot and tactic captions. Ablation studies show that the
ResNet50-based spatio-temporal encoder outperforms other variants, and that
shot-wise prompt structuring leads to more coherent and accurate tactic
captioning.

TL;DR: EVS is a plug-and-play method that reduces video token redundancy by pruning temporally static patches, enabling 4x faster inference with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models face scalability issues with long videos due to quadratic processing costs and token budget limitations, causing context constraints and latency problems.

Method: Efficient Video Sampling (EVS) identifies and removes unchanged spatial patches across consecutive frames, preserving positional identity without architectural changes or retraining. Can be combined with uptraining using stochastic pruning rates.

Result: Reduces token count significantly while maintaining semantic fidelity, achieves up to 4x reduction in time-to-first-token, and enables longer input sequences. Models become robust to varying compression levels.

Conclusion: EVS unlocks scalable video-language understanding by improving efficiency-accuracy trade-offs without sacrificing quality, making long video processing practical.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently expanded from static image
understanding to video reasoning, but their scalability is fundamentally
limited by the quadratic cost of processing dense frame sequences. Long videos
often exceed the token budget of modern language models, leading to severe
context limitations and latency issues. We introduce Efficient Video Sampling
(EVS), a simple, plug-and-play method for reducing token redundancy in videos
by identifying and pruning temporally static patches -- spatial regions that
remain unchanged across consecutive frames. EVS preserves positional identity,
requires no architectural changes or retraining. We show that EVS substantially
reduces token count while maintaining semantic fidelity, enabling faster
inference and longer input sequences. Applied at inference time, EVS reduces
large language model (LLM) time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 4x with minimal
accuracy loss. When combined with an uptraining phase using stochastic pruning
rates, EVS yields models that are robust to varying compression levels and
retain full performance under aggressive pruning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EVS consistently improves efficiency-accuracy trade-offs,
unlocking scalable video-language understanding without sacrificing quality.

*Ming Gui,Johannes Schusterbauer,Timy Phan,Felix Krause,Josh Susskind,Miguel Angel Bautista,Björn Ommer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RepTok is a generative modeling framework that uses a single continuous latent token from self-supervised vision transformers for efficient image generation, achieving competitive results with minimal training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more efficient generative modeling approach by resolving spatial redundancies in 2D latent spaces and reducing training costs while maintaining competitive performance.

Method: Fine-tunes semantic token embeddings from pre-trained SSL encoders, pairs them with generative decoders trained using flow matching objective, and adds cosine-similarity loss to preserve SSL space geometry.

Result: Achieves competitive results on class-conditional ImageNet generation and reaches competitive zero-shot performance on MS-COCO under extremely limited training budgets.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned SSL representations can serve as compact and effective latent spaces for efficient generative modeling.

Abstract: We introduce Representation Tokenizer (RepTok), a generative modeling
framework that represents an image using a single continuous latent token
obtained from self-supervised vision transformers. Building on a pre-trained
SSL encoder, we fine-tune only the semantic token embedding and pair it with a
generative decoder trained jointly using a standard flow matching objective.
This adaptation enriches the token with low-level, reconstruction-relevant
details, enabling faithful image reconstruction. To preserve the favorable
geometry of the original SSL space, we add a cosine-similarity loss that
regularizes the adapted token, ensuring the latent space remains smooth and
suitable for generation. Our single-token formulation resolves spatial
redundancies of 2D latent spaces and significantly reduces training costs.
Despite its simplicity and efficiency, RepTok achieves competitive results on
class-conditional ImageNet generation and naturally extends to text-to-image
synthesis, reaching competitive zero-shot performance on MS-COCO under
extremely limited training budgets. Our findings highlight the potential of
fine-tuned SSL representations as compact and effective latent spaces for
efficient generative modeling.

*Jihyun Yu,Yoojin Oh,Wonho Bae,Mingyu Kim,Junhyug Noh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SteeringTTA is a test-time adaptation method that uses Feynman-Kac steering to guide diffusion-based input adaptation for classification, improving robustness to distribution shifts without model updates or source data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based TTA methods rely on gradient guidance, which limits exploration and generalization across different distortion types in test data.

Method: Uses Feynman-Kac steering to guide diffusion-based input adaptation, maintaining multiple particle trajectories steered by cumulative top-K probabilities and an entropy schedule to balance exploration and confidence.

Result: On ImageNet-C, SteeringTTA consistently outperforms the baseline without any model updates or source data.

Conclusion: SteeringTTA provides an effective inference-only framework for test-time adaptation that improves robustness to distribution shifts through guided input adaptation.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to correct performance degradation of deep
models under distribution shifts by updating models or inputs using unlabeled
test data. Input-only diffusion-based TTA methods improve robustness for
classification to corruptions but rely on gradient guidance, limiting
exploration and generalization across distortion types. We propose SteeringTTA,
an inference-only framework that adapts Feynman-Kac steering to guide
diffusion-based input adaptation for classification with rewards driven by
pseudo-label. SteeringTTA maintains multiple particle trajectories, steered by
a combination of cumulative top-K probabilities and an entropy schedule, to
balance exploration and confidence. On ImageNet-C, SteeringTTA consistently
outperforms the baseline without any model updates or source data.

*Xinyao Liao,Xianfang Zeng,Ziye Song,Zhoujie Fu,Gang Yu,Guosheng Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A low-cost pretraining strategy for instruction-based video editing that uses in-context learning from unpaired video clips, followed by fine-tuning with minimal paired data, achieving superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of high cost and complexity in constructing large-scale paired video editing datasets for instruction-based video editing.

Method: Pretrain a foundation video generation model using in-context learning from ~1M unpaired video clips, then fine-tune with fewer than 150k curated editing pairs. Built upon HunyuanVideoT2V.

Result: Achieves 12% improvement in editing instruction following and 15% improvement in editing quality compared to existing instruction-based video editing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed low-cost pretraining strategy effectively endows video generation models with general editing capabilities and can be efficiently refined with minimal paired data, outperforming current methods.

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of instruction-based image editing, its extension
to video remains underexplored, primarily due to the prohibitive cost and
complexity of constructing large-scale paired video editing datasets. To
address this challenge, we introduce a low-cost pretraining strategy for
instruction-based video editing that leverages in-context learning from
unpaired video clips. We show that pretraining a foundation video generation
model with this strategy endows it with general editing capabilities, such as
adding, replacing, or deleting operations, according to input editing
instructions. The pretrained model can then be efficiently refined with a small
amount of high-quality paired editing data. Built upon HunyuanVideoT2V, our
framework first pretrains on approximately 1M real video clips to learn basic
editing concepts, and subsequently fine-tunes on fewer than 150k curated
editing pairs to extend more editing tasks and improve the editing quality.
Comparative experiments show that our method surpasses existing
instruction-based video editing approaches in both instruction alignment and
visual fidelity, achieving a 12\% improvement in editing instruction following
and a 15\% improvement in editing quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DBP-MAE integrates Decorrelated Backpropagation into MAE pre-training to accelerate convergence, reducing training time by 21.1%, carbon emissions by 21.4%, while improving downstream segmentation performance by 1.1 mIoU points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAE pre-training for vision transformers provides strong performance but is computationally expensive and impractical for time- and resource-constrained industrial settings.

Method: Integrate Decorrelated Backpropagation (DBP) into MAE pre-training, applying it selectively to the encoder to iteratively reduce input correlations at each layer for faster convergence without stability loss.

Result: On ImageNet-1K pre-training with ADE20K fine-tuning: 21.1% reduction in wall-clock time to baseline performance, 21.4% lower carbon emissions, and 1.1 points improvement in segmentation mIoU. Similar gains observed on proprietary industrial data.

Conclusion: DBP can effectively reduce training time and energy consumption while improving downstream performance for large-scale ViT pre-training, making it applicable in real-world industrial scenarios.

Abstract: Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pre-training of vision transformers (ViTs) yields
strong performance in low-label regimes but comes with substantial
computational costs, making it impractical in time- and resource-constrained
industrial settings. We address this by integrating Decorrelated
Backpropagation (DBP) into MAE pre-training, an optimization method that
iteratively reduces input correlations at each layer to accelerate convergence.
Applied selectively to the encoder, DBP achieves faster pre-training without
loss of stability. On ImageNet-1K pre-training with ADE20K fine-tuning, DBP-MAE
reduces wall-clock time to baseline performance by 21.1%, lowers carbon
emissions by 21.4% and improves segmentation mIoU by 1.1 points. We observe
similar gains when pre-training and fine-tuning on proprietary industrial data,
confirming the method's applicability in real-world scenarios. These results
demonstrate that DBP can reduce training time and energy use while improving
downstream performance for large-scale ViT pre-training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EuroMineNet is the first comprehensive multitemporal benchmark for mining footprint mapping using Sentinel-2 imagery, covering 133 EU mining sites from 2015-2024 with expert-verified annotations to support GeoAI-based environmental monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mining activities cause significant environmental degradation but existing datasets lack temporal depth and geographic scope for consistent long-term monitoring of mining-induced land surface changes.

Method: Created EuroMineNet dataset with 133 mining sites across EU using Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery from 2015-2024, providing annual observations and expert-verified annotations. Supports two tasks: multitemporal mining footprint mapping and cross-temporal change detection.

Result: Benchmarked 20 state-of-the-art deep learning models, showing GeoAI methods effectively identify long-term environmental changes but struggle with detecting short-term dynamics critical for timely mitigation.

Conclusion: EuroMineNet advances temporally consistent and explainable mining monitoring for sustainable land-use management and environmental resilience, contributing to GeoAI applications for social and environmental good.

Abstract: Mining activities are essential for industrial and economic development, but
remain a leading source of environmental degradation, contributing to
deforestation, soil erosion, and water contamination. Sustainable resource
management and environmental governance require consistent, long-term
monitoring of mining-induced land surface changes, yet existing datasets are
often limited in temporal depth or geographic scope. To address this gap, we
present EuroMineNet, the first comprehensive multitemporal benchmark for mining
footprint mapping and monitoring based on Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery.
Spanning 133 mining sites across the European Union, EuroMineNet provides
annual observations and expert-verified annotations from 2015 to 2024, enabling
GeoAI-based models to analyze environmental dynamics at a continental scale. It
supports two sustainability-driven tasks: (1) multitemporal mining footprint
mapping for consistent annual land-use delineation, evaluated with a novel
Change-Aware Temporal IoU (CA-TIoU) metric, and (2) cross-temporal change
detection to capture both gradual and abrupt surface transformations.
Benchmarking 20 state-of-the-art deep learning models reveals that while GeoAI
methods effectively identify long-term environmental changes, challenges remain
in detecting short-term dynamics critical for timely mitigation. By advancing
temporally consistent and explainable mining monitoring, EuroMineNet
contributes to sustainable land-use management, environmental resilience, and
the broader goal of applying GeoAI for social and environmental good. We
release the codes and datasets by aligning with FAIR and the open science
paradigm at https://github.com/EricYu97/EuroMineNet.

*Md. Abdur Rahman,Mohaimenul Azam Khan Raiaan,Sami Azam,Asif Karim,Jemima Beissbarth,Amanda Leach*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WeCKD introduces a chain-based knowledge distillation framework where models learn progressively from predecessors, reducing data dependency and improving performance in limited-data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional KD suffers from knowledge degradation, inefficient supervision, and reliance on strong teachers or large datasets, limiting effectiveness in real-world limited-data scenarios.

Method: Progressive distillation chain where each model learns from its predecessor and refines knowledge before passing forward, with each model trained on only a fraction of the dataset.

Result: Achieves up to +23% accuracy gain over single backbone models, surpasses existing supervised methods on otoscopic imaging datasets, and generalizes well to other medical imaging modalities.

Conclusion: WeCKD provides an effective solution for knowledge transfer in limited-data scenarios, demonstrating strong performance across diverse medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has traditionally relied on a static
teacher-student framework, where a large, well-trained teacher transfers
knowledge to a single student model. However, these approaches often suffer
from knowledge degradation, inefficient supervision, and reliance on either a
very strong teacher model or large labeled datasets, which limits their
effectiveness in real-world, limited-data scenarios. To address these, we
present the first-ever Weakly-supervised Chain-based KD network (WeCKD) that
redefines knowledge transfer through a structured sequence of interconnected
models. Unlike conventional KD, it forms a progressive distillation chain,
where each model not only learns from its predecessor but also refines the
knowledge before passing it forward. This structured knowledge transfer further
enhances feature learning, reduces data dependency, and mitigates the
limitations of one-step KD. Each model in the distillation chain is trained on
only a fraction of the dataset and demonstrates that effective learning can be
achieved with minimal supervision. Extensive evaluations across four otoscopic
imaging datasets demonstrate that it not only matches but in many cases
surpasses the performance of existing supervised methods. Experimental results
on two other datasets further underscore its generalization across diverse
medical imaging modalities, including microscopic and magnetic resonance
imaging. Furthermore, our evaluations resulted in cumulative accuracy gains of
up to +23% over a single backbone trained on the same limited data, which
highlights its potential for real-world adoption.

TL;DR: VTimeCoT is a training-free framework that enhances video temporal grounding and reasoning in MLLMs by integrating progress bar tools and visuotemporal chain-of-thought reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal large language models have deficiencies in video temporal grounding and reasoning, limiting their effectiveness for real-world video understanding systems.

Method: Uses two visual tools: plug-and-play progress bar integration and high-efficiency highlighting tool, plus visuotemporal chain-of-thought reasoning that integrates cross-modality reasoning across video and text.

Result: Significant performance improvements on Qwen2VL-7B and GPT4o baselines for video temporal grounding and reasoning-based question answering.

Conclusion: The framework achieves compositional and interpretable reasoning process, enhancing video understanding capabilities of MLLMs.

Abstract: In recent years, video question answering based on multimodal large language
models (MLLM) has garnered considerable attention, due to the benefits from the
substantial advancements in LLMs. However, these models have a notable
deficiency in the domains of video temporal grounding and reasoning, posing
challenges to the development of effective real-world video understanding
systems. Inspired by how humans use video players to interact with the progress
bar for video comprehension, we introduce VTimeCoT, a simple yet effective
training-free framework, designed for high-performance video grounding and
reasoning. The proposed framework incorporates two novel visual tools of the
progress bar: a plug-and-play progress bar integration tool and a
high-efficiency highlighting tool. In addition, to address the limitations of
conventional text-based chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, we introduce a
visuotemporal CoT process that integrates cross-modality reasoning across both
video and text. Our approach demonstrates significant performance improvements
on both Qwen2VL-7B and GPT4o baselines in tasks of video temporal grounding and
reasoning-based question answering. Finally, we showcase that the proposed
framework achieves a compositional and interpretable reasoning process. Project

*Seungjoo Shin,Jaesik Park,Sunghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel 3D Gaussian Splatting compression framework that uses learned image priors to restore quality degradation from compression, achieving superior rate-distortion performance with less storage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS compression methods lack learned priors, limiting further advances in rate-distortion trade-off despite achieving considerable storage reduction.

Method: Uses a restoration network to model compression artifacts in image space between degraded and original Gaussians, incorporates coarse rendering residuals as side information, and refines compressed Gaussians using restored image supervision.

Result: Superior rate-distortion performance compared to state-of-the-art 3DGS compression methods, with enhanced rendering quality requiring substantially less storage.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages learned image priors to recover compression-induced quality degradation, is compatible with existing Gaussian compression methods, and achieves highly compact representations with improved rendering performance.

Abstract: Compression techniques for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have recently
achieved considerable success in minimizing storage overhead for 3D Gaussians
while preserving high rendering quality. Despite the impressive storage
reduction, the lack of learned priors restricts further advances in the
rate-distortion trade-off for 3DGS compression tasks. To address this, we
introduce a novel 3DGS compression framework that leverages the powerful
representational capacity of learned image priors to recover
compression-induced quality degradation. Built upon initially compressed
Gaussians, our restoration network effectively models the compression artifacts
in the image space between degraded and original Gaussians. To enhance the
rate-distortion performance, we provide coarse rendering residuals into the
restoration network as side information. By leveraging the supervision of
restored images, the compressed Gaussians are refined, resulting in a highly
compact representation with enhanced rendering performance. Our framework is
designed to be compatible with existing Gaussian compression methods, making it
broadly applicable across different baselines. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating superior rate-distortion
performance and outperforming the rendering quality of state-of-the-art 3DGS
compression methods while requiring substantially less storage.

TL;DR: Semi-automated whale detection in satellite imagery using statistical anomaly detection to flag spatial outliers, reducing expert inspection area by up to 99.8% while maintaining high recall rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional whale monitoring methods are expensive and difficult to scale, while automated detection faces challenges due to lack of annotated data, image variability, and high computational costs.

Method: Statistical anomaly detection method that flags spatial outliers ('interesting points') paired with a web-based labeling interface for expert annotation, without requiring labeled training data.

Result: Achieved recalls of 90.3% to 96.4% on benchmark scenes while reducing expert inspection area by up to 99.8% (from over 1,000 sq km to less than 2 sq km).

Conclusion: The approach provides a scalable first step for machine-assisted marine mammal monitoring from space and has been open-sourced for community use.

Abstract: Effective monitoring of whale populations is critical for conservation, but
traditional survey methods are expensive and difficult to scale. While prior
work has shown that whales can be identified in very high-resolution (VHR)
satellite imagery, large-scale automated detection remains challenging due to a
lack of annotated imagery, variability in image quality and environmental
conditions, and the cost of building robust machine learning pipelines over
massive remote sensing archives. We present a semi-automated approach for
surfacing possible whale detections in VHR imagery using a statistical anomaly
detection method that flags spatial outliers, i.e. "interesting points". We
pair this detector with a web-based labeling interface designed to enable
experts to quickly annotate the interesting points. We evaluate our system on
three benchmark scenes with known whale annotations and achieve recalls of
90.3% to 96.4%, while reducing the area requiring expert inspection by up to
99.8% -- from over 1,000 sq km to less than 2 sq km in some cases. Our method
does not rely on labeled training data and offers a scalable first step toward
future machine-assisted marine mammal monitoring from space. We have open
sourced this pipeline at https://github.com/microsoft/whales.

TL;DR: Proposes Cross-Layer Feature Self-Attention Module (CFSAM) that models local and global dependencies across multi-scale features for object detection, achieving significant performance gains on PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attention mechanisms in object detection are limited to single-layer or dual-layer feature refinement, missing rich inter-layer dependencies across multi-scale representations needed for handling large scale variations in objects.

Method: CFSAM consists of three components: convolutional local feature extractor, Transformer-based global modeling unit for cross-layer interactions, and feature fusion mechanism to enhance original representations. Integrated into SSD300 framework.

Result: Achieved 78.6% mAP on PASCAL VOC (vs 75.5% baseline) and 52.1% mAP on COCO (vs 43.1% baseline), outperforming existing attention modules. Also accelerates convergence during training without substantial computational overhead.

Conclusion: Explicit cross-layer attention modeling is crucial for advancing multi-scale object detection, as demonstrated by CFSAM's significant performance improvements and training efficiency.

Abstract: Recent object detection methods have made remarkable progress by leveraging
attention mechanisms to improve feature discriminability. However, most
existing approaches are confined to refining single-layer or fusing dual-layer
features, overlooking the rich inter-layer dependencies across multi-scale
representations. This limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual
information essential for detecting objects with large scale variations. In
this paper, we propose a novel Cross-Layer Feature Self-Attention Module
(CFSAM), which holistically models both local and global dependencies within
multi-scale feature maps. CFSAM consists of three key components: a
convolutional local feature extractor, a Transformer-based global modeling unit
that efficiently captures cross-layer interactions, and a feature fusion
mechanism to restore and enhance the original representations. When integrated
into the SSD300 framework, CFSAM significantly boosts detection performance,
achieving 78.6% mAP on PASCAL VOC (vs. 75.5% baseline) and 52.1% mAP on COCO
(vs. 43.1% baseline), outperforming existing attention modules. Moreover, the
module accelerates convergence during training without introducing substantial
computational overhead. Our work highlights the importance of explicit
cross-layer attention modeling in advancing multi-scale object detection.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ImageNet-F, a hierarchical image classification benchmark with mixed-granularity labels that better reflects real-world annotation scenarios, and proposes free-grain learning methods to handle heterogeneous supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hierarchical classification methods assume complete fine-grained annotations, which doesn't reflect real-world scenarios where supervision varies in granularity due to factors like image quality, annotator expertise, and task demands.

Method: Created ImageNet-F benchmark from ImageNet with cognitively inspired hierarchical levels (basic, subordinate, fine-grained). Used CLIP to simulate realistic mixed-granularity labels. Proposed free-grain learning with methods that enhance semantic guidance via pseudo-attributes from vision-language models and visual guidance via semi-supervised learning.

Result: The proposed methods, along with strong baselines, substantially improve performance under mixed supervision conditions compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: The ImageNet-F benchmark and free-grain learning methods advance hierarchical classification under real-world constraints by better handling the natural variation in annotation granularity that occurs in practice.

Abstract: Hierarchical image classification predicts labels across a semantic taxonomy,
but existing methods typically assume complete, fine-grained annotations, an
assumption rarely met in practice. Real-world supervision varies in
granularity, influenced by image quality, annotator expertise, and task
demands; a distant bird may be labeled Bird, while a close-up reveals Bald
eagle. We introduce ImageNet-F, a large-scale benchmark curated from ImageNet
and structured into cognitively inspired basic, subordinate, and fine-grained
levels. Using CLIP as a proxy for semantic ambiguity, we simulate realistic,
mixed-granularity labels reflecting human annotation behavior. We propose
free-grain learning, with heterogeneous supervision across instances. We
develop methods that enhance semantic guidance via pseudo-attributes from
vision-language models and visual guidance via semi-supervised learning. These,
along with strong baselines, substantially improve performance under mixed
supervision. Together, our benchmark and methods advance hierarchical
classification under real-world constraints.

Motivation: To build transparent and trustworthy AI systems by understanding and explaining machine learning model behavior, especially for visual classifiers.

Method: Optimizes text prompts to synthesize class-conditional images that strongly activate target classifiers, then uses these synthetic samples to generate natural language reports describing class-specific decision patterns and biases.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches in global model explanation and class-level bias reporting across ImageNet, Waterbirds, CelebA, and FairFaces datasets, producing accurate and interpretable outputs.

Conclusion: DEXTER provides an effective data-free solution for explaining visual classifiers through natural language, enabling better understanding of model decision processes and biases without requiring original training data.

Abstract: Understanding and explaining the behavior of machine learning models is
essential for building transparent and trustworthy AI systems. We introduce
DEXTER, a data-free framework that employs diffusion models and large language
models to generate global, textual explanations of visual classifiers. DEXTER
operates by optimizing text prompts to synthesize class-conditional images that
strongly activate a target classifier. These synthetic samples are then used to
elicit detailed natural language reports that describe class-specific decision
patterns and biases. Unlike prior work, DEXTER enables natural language
explanation about a classifier's decision process without access to training
data or ground-truth labels. We demonstrate DEXTER's flexibility across three
tasks-activation maximization, slice discovery and debiasing, and bias
explanation-each illustrating its ability to uncover the internal mechanisms of
visual classifiers. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including a user
study, show that DEXTER produces accurate, interpretable outputs. Experiments
on ImageNet, Waterbirds, CelebA, and FairFaces confirm that DEXTER outperforms
existing approaches in global model explanation and class-level bias reporting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LightQANet introduces quantized and adaptive feature learning for low-light image enhancement, using a Light Quantization Module for structured light factor learning and a Light-Aware Prompt Module for dynamic adaptation to varying lighting conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing low-light image enhancement methods often fail to extract reliable feature representations due to severely degraded pixel-level information under low-light conditions, leading to poor texture restoration, color inconsistency, and artifacts.

Method: Proposes LightQANet with two key components: 1) Light Quantization Module (LQM) to explicitly extract and quantify illumination-related factors, enhancing light-invariant representations; 2) Light-Aware Prompt Module (LAPM) that encodes illumination priors into learnable prompts to dynamically guide feature learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple low-light datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior qualitative and quantitative results across various challenging lighting scenarios.

Conclusion: LightQANet effectively addresses the challenges in low-light image enhancement by combining static light factor quantization with dynamic adaptation mechanisms, achieving consistent and robust image quality across diverse lighting conditions.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve illumination while
preserving high-quality color and texture. However, existing methods often fail
to extract reliable feature representations due to severely degraded
pixel-level information under low-light conditions, resulting in poor texture
restoration, color inconsistency, and artifact. To address these challenges, we
propose LightQANet, a novel framework that introduces quantized and adaptive
feature learning for low-light enhancement, aiming to achieve consistent and
robust image quality across diverse lighting conditions. From the static
modeling perspective, we design a Light Quantization Module (LQM) to explicitly
extract and quantify illumination-related factors from image features. By
enforcing structured light factor learning, LQM enhances the extraction of
light-invariant representations and mitigates feature inconsistency across
varying illumination levels. From the dynamic adaptation perspective, we
introduce a Light-Aware Prompt Module (LAPM), which encodes illumination priors
into learnable prompts to dynamically guide the feature learning process. LAPM
enables the model to flexibly adapt to complex and continuously changing
lighting conditions, further improving image enhancement. Extensive experiments
on multiple low-light datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior qualitative and quantitative
results across various challenging lighting scenarios.

*Giuseppe Lorenzo Catalano,Agata Marta Soccini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an unconditional diffusion model for reconstructing Martian terrain heightmaps with missing data, outperforming traditional interpolation methods in accuracy and perceptual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Space exploration relies on accurate 3D planetary terrain simulations, but Mars heightmaps often contain missing values. Current interpolation methods fail to preserve geometric coherence, and conditional deep learning approaches used on Earth can't be applied to Mars due to incomplete datasets.

Method: Uses an unconditional diffusion model trained on 12,000 Martian heightmaps from NASA's HiRISE survey. Implements non-homogeneous rescaling to capture multi-scale terrain features before resizing to 128x128 resolution.

Result: Outperformed established methods (Inverse Distance Weighting, kriging, Navier-Stokes) on 1000 test samples, achieving 4-15% improvement in RMSE and 29-81% improvement in LPIPS perceptual similarity compared to original data.

Conclusion: The unconditional diffusion model approach provides superior Martian terrain reconstruction compared to traditional interpolation techniques, offering better accuracy and geometric coherence for space exploration applications.

Abstract: Space exploration increasingly relies on Virtual Reality for several tasks,
such as mission planning, multidisciplinary scientific analysis, and astronaut
training. A key factor for the reliability of the simulations is having
accurate 3D representations of planetary terrains. Extraterrestrial heightmaps
derived from satellite imagery often contain missing values due to acquisition
and transmission constraints. Mars is among the most studied planets beyond
Earth, and its extensive terrain datasets make the Martian surface
reconstruction a valuable task, although many areas remain unmapped. Deep
learning algorithms can support void-filling tasks; however, whereas Earth's
comprehensive datasets enables the use of conditional methods, such approaches
cannot be applied to Mars. Current approaches rely on simpler interpolation
techniques which, however, often fail to preserve geometric coherence. In this
work, we propose a method for reconstructing the surface of Mars based on an
unconditional diffusion model. Training was conducted on an augmented dataset
of 12000 Martian heightmaps derived from NASA's HiRISE survey. A
non-homogeneous rescaling strategy captures terrain features across multiple
scales before resizing to a fixed 128x128 model resolution. We compared our
method against established void-filling and inpainting techniques, including
Inverse Distance Weighting, kriging, and Navier-Stokes algorithm, on an
evaluation set of 1000 samples. Results show that our approach consistently
outperforms these methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy (4-15% on RMSE)
and perceptual similarity (29-81% on LPIPS) with the original data.

*Zhang Nengbo,Hann Woei Ho,Ye Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A visual communication framework for MAV swarms using motion-based signaling inspired by honeybee waggle dance, employing event cameras and SNNs for energy-efficient information transmission.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional radio-based MAV communication suffers from spectrum congestion, jamming, and high power consumption, necessitating alternative communication methods for constrained environments.

Method: MAVs convey information through deliberate flight patterns captured by event cameras, using four motion primitives as control symbols. A segmentation model and lightweight SNN decode the signals through an integrated decoding algorithm.

Result: Experimental validation shows accurate decoding performance and low power consumption, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed visual communication framework offers a promising energy-efficient alternative for MAV swarm communication in constrained environments.

Abstract: Reliable communication in Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) swarms is challenging in
environments, where conventional radio-based methods suffer from spectrum
congestion, jamming, and high power consumption. Inspired by the waggle dance
of honeybees, which efficiently communicate the location of food sources
without sound or contact, we propose a novel visual communication framework for
MAV swarms using motion-based signaling. In this framework, MAVs convey
information, such as heading and distance, through deliberate flight patterns,
which are passively captured by event cameras and interpreted using a
predefined visual codebook of four motion primitives: vertical (up/down),
horizontal (left/right), left-to-up-to-right, and left-to-down-to-right,
representing control symbols (``start'', ``end'', ``1'', ``0''). To decode
these signals, we design an event frame-based segmentation model and a
lightweight Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for action recognition. An integrated
decoding algorithm then combines segmentation and classification to robustly
interpret MAV motion sequences. Experimental results validate the framework's
effectiveness, which demonstrates accurate decoding and low power consumption,
and highlights its potential as an energy-efficient alternative for MAV
communication in constrained environments.

### [73] [CoT-PL: Visual Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Meets Pseudo-Labeling for Open-Vocabulary Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14792)
*Hojun Choi,Youngsun Lim,Jaeyo Shin,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoT-PL introduces chain-of-thought reasoning into pseudo-labeling for open-vocabulary object detection, achieving significant improvements in crowded and occluded scenes through structured visual reasoning and contrastive background learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OVD methods rely on direct image-text matching but lack intermediate reasoning steps, leading to limited robustness in crowded or occluded scenes where semantic complexity challenges detection.

Method: CoT-PL decomposes object understanding into three steps: region perception, category recognition via zero-shot reasoning, and background grounding. It integrates contrastive background learning (CBL) that uses background cues as negatives to disentangle object and background features.

Result: Achieves 103.4% and 168.4% relative improvements in novel-class pseudo-label quality for crowded and occluded scenes respectively. Sets new SOTA with +7.7 AP50 on open-vocabulary COCO and +2.9 mask AP on LVIS for novel classes.

Conclusion: Structured chain-of-thought reasoning combined with contrastive background learning significantly enhances pseudo-labeling robustness in complex visual contexts, establishing a new state-of-the-art approach for open-vocabulary object detection.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) seeks to recognize and localize object
categories beyond those seen during training. Recent approaches typically
leverage vision-language models (VLMs) to generate pseudo-labels using
image-text alignment, allowing detectors to generalize to unseen classes
without explicit supervision. However, these methods depend heavily on direct
image-text matching, neglecting the intermediate reasoning steps essential for
interpreting semantically complex scenes. This results in limited robustness
when confronted with crowded or occluded visual contexts. In this paper, we
introduce CoT-PL, a new framework that employs structured visual
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning into the pseudo-labeling process. CoT-PL
decomposes object understanding into three interpretable steps: (1) region
perception even for unseen objects, (2) category recognition via zero-shot
reasoning, and (3) background grounding to separate semantically complex
objects. Crucially, the third step naturally motivates our contrastive
background learning (CBL) that uses the pre-computed background cues as
negatives to promote feature disentanglement between objects and background. In
this way, CoT reasoning and CBL form an integrated pipeline tailored to robust
pseudo-labeling in crowded or occluded scenes. Notably, in these two settings,
our novel-class pseudo-label quality achieves relative improvements of 103.4%
and 168.4% over the best prior, respectively. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that CoT-PL achieves +7.7 AP50 on open-vocabulary COCO and +2.9
mask AP on LVIS for novel classes, setting a new state of the art.

*Usama Sajjad,Abdul Rehman Akbar,Ziyu Su,Deborah Knight,Wendy L. Frankel,Metin N. Gurcan,Wei Chen,Muhammad Khalid Khan Niazi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM is an interpretable AI model for colorectal cancer prognosis that captures continuous morphological variability, achieving superior 5-year overall survival prediction (AUC=0.70) and outperforming existing methods by 15-23% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation models in computational pathology overlook organ-specific morphological patterns that influence tumor behavior and patient outcomes. CRC remains a major global health concern with 154,000 new cases projected for 2025.

Method: PRISM incorporates continuous variability spectrum within distinct morphologies to characterize phenotypic diversity, trained on 8.74 million histological images from 424 stage III CRC patients' surgical resection specimens.

Result: Superior prognostic performance for 5-year OS (AUC=0.70±0.04, accuracy=68.37%±4.75%, HR=3.34), outperforming CRC-specific methods by 15% and foundation models by ~23% accuracy. Showed sex-agnostic robustness and stable performance across subgroups.

Conclusion: PRISM successfully captures incremental evolutionary processes in CRC through continuous morphological variability, providing interpretable prognostic predictions that reflect biological tumor progression principles.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the third most prevalent malignancy globally,
with approximately 154,000 new cases and 54,000 projected deaths anticipated
for 2025. The recent advancement of foundation models in computational
pathology has been largely propelled by task agnostic methodologies that can
overlook organ-specific crucial morphological patterns that represent distinct
biological processes that can fundamentally influence tumor behavior,
therapeutic response, and patient outcomes. The aim of this study is to develop
a novel, interpretable AI model, PRISM (Prognostic Representation of Integrated
Spatial Morphology), that incorporates a continuous variability spectrum within
each distinct morphology to characterize phenotypic diversity and reflecting
the principle that malignant transformation occurs through incremental
evolutionary processes rather than abrupt phenotypic shifts. PRISM is trained
on 8.74 million histological images extracted from surgical resection specimens
of 424 patients with stage III CRC. PRISM achieved superior prognostic
performance for five-year OS (AUC = 0.70 +- 0.04; accuracy = 68.37% +- 4.75%;
HR = 3.34, 95% CI = 2.28-4.90; p < 0.0001), outperforming existing CRC-specific
methods by 15% and AI foundation models by ~23% accuracy. It showed
sex-agnostic robustness (AUC delta = 0.02; accuracy delta = 0.15%) and stable
performance across clinicopathological subgroups, with minimal accuracy
fluctuation (delta = 1.44%) between 5FU/LV and CPT-11/5FU/LV regimens,
replicating the Alliance cohort finding of no survival difference between
treatments.

TL;DR: R-Super trains AI models to segment tumors using medical reports instead of expensive manual tumor masks, achieving comparable performance while enabling segmentation of previously unsupported tumor types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual tumor mask creation for AI training is costly and time-consuming, while medical reports containing tumor descriptions are abundant but underutilized.

Method: R-Super trains AI models to segment tumors that match descriptions in medical reports, leveraging large collections of readily available reports rather than relying solely on manually drawn tumor masks.

Result: Models trained on 101,654 reports achieved performance comparable to those trained on 723 masks. Combining reports and masks improved sensitivity by +13% and specificity by +8%, surpassing radiologists in detecting 5 of 7 tumor types.

Conclusion: This approach challenges the necessity of labor-intensive tumor mask creation and provides a scalable path for early tumor detection across diverse tumor types, including previously unsupported organs.

Abstract: Early tumor detection save lives. Each year, more than 300 million computed
tomography (CT) scans are performed worldwide, offering a vast opportunity for
effective cancer screening. However, detecting small or early-stage tumors on
these CT scans remains challenging, even for experts. Artificial intelligence
(AI) models can assist by highlighting suspicious regions, but training such
models typically requires extensive tumor masks--detailed, voxel-wise outlines
of tumors manually drawn by radiologists. Drawing these masks is costly,
requiring years of effort and millions of dollars. In contrast, nearly every CT
scan in clinical practice is already accompanied by medical reports describing
the tumor's size, number, appearance, and sometimes, pathology
results--information that is rich, abundant, and often underutilized for AI
training. We introduce R-Super, which trains AI to segment tumors that match
their descriptions in medical reports. This approach scales AI training with
large collections of readily available medical reports, substantially reducing
the need for manually drawn tumor masks. When trained on 101,654 reports, AI
models achieved performance comparable to those trained on 723 masks. Combining
reports and masks further improved sensitivity by +13% and specificity by +8%,
surpassing radiologists in detecting five of the seven tumor types. Notably,
R-Super enabled segmentation of tumors in the spleen, gallbladder, prostate,
bladder, uterus, and esophagus, for which no public masks or AI models
previously existed. This study challenges the long-held belief that
large-scale, labor-intensive tumor mask creation is indispensable, establishing
a scalable and accessible path toward early detection across diverse tumor
types.

### [76] [Unifying Environment Perception and Route Choice Modeling for Trajectory Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14819)
*Ji Cao,Yu Wang,Tongya Zheng,Zujie Ren,Canghong Jin,Gang Chen,Mingli Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRTraj is a novel trajectory representation learning framework that integrates environment perception and route choice modeling to create more effective trajectory embeddings for downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing trajectory representation methods treat trajectories as isolated sequences without considering external environmental factors and internal route choice behaviors that shape trajectory formation.

Method: PRTraj uses an Environment Perception Module to capture multi-granularity environmental semantics from POI distributions, and a Route Choice Encoder that models road segment transitions as decision sequences to capture route choice behavior.

Result: Extensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets across 5 downstream tasks show PRTraj's effectiveness, generalizability, and strong data efficiency with robust performance in few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: PRTraj successfully bridges the gap in trajectory representation learning by unifying environment perception and route choice modeling, demonstrating superior performance across multiple tasks and datasets.

Abstract: Trajectory Representation Learning (TRL) aims to encode raw trajectories into
low-dimensional vectors, which can then be leveraged in various downstream
tasks, including travel time estimation, location prediction, and trajectory
similarity analysis. However, existing TRL methods suffer from a key oversight:
treating trajectories as isolated spatio-temporal sequences, without
considering the external environment and internal route choice behavior that
govern their formation. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that
unifies comprehensive environment \textbf{P}erception and explicit
\textbf{R}oute choice modeling for effective \textbf{Traj}ectory representation
learning, dubbed \textbf{PRTraj}. Specifically, PRTraj first introduces an
Environment Perception Module to enhance the road network by capturing
multi-granularity environmental semantics from surrounding POI distributions.
Building on this environment-aware backbone, a Route Choice Encoder then
captures the route choice behavior inherent in each trajectory by modeling its
constituent road segment transitions as a sequence of decisions. These
route-choice-aware representations are finally aggregated to form the global
trajectory embedding. Extensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets across 5
downstream tasks validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PRTraj.
Moreover, PRTraj demonstrates strong data efficiency, maintaining robust
performance under few-shot scenarios. Our code is available at:

*Luca Morreale,Alberto Gil C. P. Ramos,Malcolm Chadwick,Mehid Noroozi,Ruchika Chavhan,Abhinav Mehrotra,Sourav Bhattacharya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes fractional bits quantization (SHORT) to progressively reduce model precision from 32 to 4 bits while maintaining generation quality, enabling deployment of large generative models on smartphones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large generative models cannot be deployed on smartphones due to memory and computation constraints, and aggressive quantization methods struggle to preserve model quality.

Method: Fractional bits quantization approach that progressively reduces model precision from 32 to 4 bits per parameter, exploiting fractional bits during optimization to maintain quality.

Result: SHORT yields improved quality on various diffusion models (SD3.5-Medium, Sana, PixArt, FLUX.1-schnell) with 4-7% lower FiD than standard QAT, and successfully deployed Sana on Samsung S25U with Snapdragon 8 Elite HTP.

Conclusion: Fractional bits quantization enables efficient deployment of large generative models on mobile devices while maintaining high generation quality.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in image synthesis or text generation, often with a large capacity
model. However, these large models cannot be deployed on smartphones due to the
limited availability of on-board memory and computations. Quantization methods
lower the precision of the model parameters, allowing for efficient
computations, \eg, in \INT{8}. Although aggressive quantization addresses
efficiency and memory constraints, preserving the quality of the model remains
a challenge. To retain quality in previous aggressive quantization, we propose
a new fractional bits quantization (\short) approach. The novelty is a simple
yet effective idea: we progressively reduce the model's precision from 32 to 4
bits per parameter, and exploit the fractional bits during optimization to
maintain high generation quality. We show that the \short{} yields improved
quality on a variety of diffusion models, including SD3.5-Medium, Sana,
\pixart, and FLUX.1-schnell, while achieving $4-7\%$ lower FiD than standard
QAT. Finally, we deploy and run Sana on a Samsung S25U, which runs on the
Qualcomm SM8750-AB Snapdragon 8 Elite Hexagon Tensor Processor (HTP).

TL;DR: Synthetic data can match AI tumor segmentation performance using fewer real scans. AbdomenAtlas 2.0 provides 10,135 CT scans with 15,130 tumor instances across 6 organs, achieving +7-16% DSC improvements over existing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI for tumor segmentation is limited by the lack of large, voxel-wise annotated datasets, which are hard to create and require medical experts. The proprietary JHH dataset showed performance plateauing at 1,500 scans.

Method: Created AbdomenAtlas 2.0 - a dataset of 10,135 CT scans with 15,130 tumor instances manually annotated by 23 expert radiologists across six organs (pancreas, liver, kidney, colon, esophagus, uterus) plus 5,893 control scans.

Result: Synthetic data reached same performance using only 500 real scans vs. 1,500 real scans. AbdomenAtlas 2.0 achieves +7% DSC gain on in-distribution tests and +16% on out-of-distribution tests compared to public datasets.

Conclusion: Synthetic data can steepen data scaling laws, enabling more efficient model training than real data alone. AbdomenAtlas 2.0 provides a strong foundation for training AI to segment tumors in six organs based on lessons from the JHH dataset.

Abstract: AI for tumor segmentation is limited by the lack of large, voxel-wise
annotated datasets, which are hard to create and require medical experts. In
our proprietary JHH dataset of 3,000 annotated pancreatic tumor scans, we found
that AI performance stopped improving after 1,500 scans. With synthetic data,
we reached the same performance using only 500 real scans. This finding
suggests that synthetic data can steepen data scaling laws, enabling more
efficient model training than real data alone. Motivated by these lessons, we
created AbdomenAtlas 2.0--a dataset of 10,135 CT scans with a total of 15,130
tumor instances per-voxel manually annotated in six organs (pancreas, liver,
kidney, colon, esophagus, and uterus) and 5,893 control scans. Annotated by 23
expert radiologists, it is several orders of magnitude larger than existing
public tumor datasets. While we continue expanding the dataset, the current
version of AbdomenAtlas 2.0 already provides a strong foundation--based on
lessons from the JHH dataset--for training AI to segment tumors in six organs.
It achieves notable improvements over public datasets, with a +7% DSC gain on
in-distribution tests and +16% on out-of-distribution tests.

Motivation: To evaluate and compare the performance of open-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with existing face recognition models on standard benchmarks, as their potential in face recognition remains underexplored.

Method: Conducted systematic benchmarking of state-of-the-art MLLMs on several face recognition datasets including LFW, CALFW, CPLFW, CFP, AgeDB and RFW using similar protocols as existing models.

Result: MLLMs capture rich semantic cues useful for face-related tasks but lag behind specialized face recognition models in high-precision recognition scenarios in zero-shot applications.

Conclusion: The benchmark provides a foundation for advancing MLLM-based face recognition and offers insights for designing next-generation models with higher accuracy and generalization.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance
across diverse vision-and-language tasks. However, their potential in face
recognition remains underexplored. In particular, the performance of
open-source MLLMs needs to be evaluated and compared with existing face

we present a systematic benchmark of state-of-the-art MLLMs for face
recognition on several face recognition datasets, including LFW, CALFW, CPLFW,
CFP, AgeDB and RFW. Experimental results reveal that while MLLMs capture rich
semantic cues useful for face-related tasks, they lag behind specialized models
in high-precision recognition scenarios in zero-shot applications. This
benchmark provides a foundation for advancing MLLM-based face recognition,
offering insights for the design of next-generation models with higher accuracy

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MaskCaptioner, an end-to-end model for Dense Video Object Captioning that jointly detects, tracks, and captions object trajectories using synthetic captions generated from a VLM and achieves SOTA results on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous approaches to DVOC use disjoint training strategies due to the complexity and high annotation costs, leading to suboptimal performance. The authors aim to create a unified end-to-end solution.

Method: Generate synthetic captions for spatio-temporally localized entities using a state-of-the-art VLM, extend LVIS and LV-VIS datasets with these captions (creating LVISCap and LV-VISCap), and train MaskCaptioner for joint detection, segmentation, tracking, and captioning.

Result: MaskCaptioner achieves state-of-the-art DVOC results on three benchmarks: VidSTG, VLN, and BenSMOT.

Conclusion: The proposed approach of using synthetic captions and end-to-end training enables superior performance in dense video object captioning, demonstrating the effectiveness of unified modeling for this complex task.

Abstract: Dense Video Object Captioning (DVOC) is the task of jointly detecting,
tracking, and captioning object trajectories in a video, requiring the ability
to understand spatio-temporal details and describe them in natural language.
Due to the complexity of the task and the high cost associated with manual
annotation, previous approaches resort to disjoint training strategies,
potentially leading to suboptimal performance. To circumvent this issue, we
propose to generate captions about spatio-temporally localized entities
leveraging a state-of-the-art VLM. By extending the LVIS and LV-VIS datasets
with our synthetic captions (LVISCap and LV-VISCap), we train MaskCaptioner, an
end-to-end model capable of jointly detecting, segmenting, tracking and
captioning object trajectories. Moreover, with pretraining on LVISCap and
LV-VISCap, MaskCaptioner achieves state-of-the-art DVOC results on three
existing benchmarks, VidSTG, VLN and BenSMOT. The datasets and code are

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models perform poorly in imaginative scenarios involving rarely co-occurring concepts with long-distance semantic relationships that fall outside training distributions.

Method: Proposes ImagerySearch - a prompt-guided adaptive test-time search strategy that dynamically adjusts both inference search space and reward function based on semantic relationships in the prompt. Also introduces LDT-Bench benchmark for long-distance semantic prompts.

Result: ImagerySearch consistently outperforms strong video generation baselines and existing test-time scaling approaches on LDT-Bench, and achieves competitive improvements on VBench across diverse prompt types.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the challenge of imaginative video generation by adapting search strategies to prompt semantics, with comprehensive evaluation showing significant improvements over existing approaches.

Abstract: Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress, particularly
excelling in realistic scenarios; however, their performance degrades notably
in imaginative scenarios. These prompts often involve rarely co-occurring
concepts with long-distance semantic relationships, falling outside training
distributions. Existing methods typically apply test-time scaling for improving
video quality, but their fixed search spaces and static reward designs limit
adaptability to imaginative scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose
ImagerySearch, a prompt-guided adaptive test-time search strategy that
dynamically adjusts both the inference search space and reward function
according to semantic relationships in the prompt. This enables more coherent
and visually plausible videos in challenging imaginative settings. To evaluate
progress in this direction, we introduce LDT-Bench, the first dedicated
benchmark for long-distance semantic prompts, consisting of 2,839 diverse
concept pairs and an automated protocol for assessing creative generation
capabilities. Extensive experiments show that ImagerySearch consistently
outperforms strong video generation baselines and existing test-time scaling
approaches on LDT-Bench, and achieves competitive improvements on VBench,
demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse prompt types. We will release
LDT-Bench and code to facilitate future research on imaginative video

*Harsha Kotla,Arun Kumar Rajasekaran,Hannah Rana*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a deep learning framework that classifies skin lesions and quantifies ABCD features from the ABCDE method, visualizing feature trajectories as lesions evolve from benign to malignant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated melanoma detection is crucial for improved survival rates, but current deep learning approaches lack interpretability of clinically relevant ABCDE features that doctors use for diagnosis.

Method: A deep learning framework that both classifies skin lesions and quantifies scores for Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Color variation, and Diameter features, simulating their evolution over time to represent the Evolving aspect.

Result: Achieved 89% classification accuracy with melanoma AUC of 0.96. Feature evaluation performed well for asymmetry, color variation, and diameter prediction, though border irregularity remained challenging to model.

Conclusion: The framework enables doctors to link ML diagnoses to clinically relevant ABCDE criteria, improving understanding of skin cancer progression and providing interpretable feature trajectories in latent space.

Abstract: Early detection of melanoma has grown to be essential because it
significantly improves survival rates, but automated analysis of skin lesions
still remains challenging. ABCDE, which stands for Asymmetry, Border
irregularity, Color variation, Diameter, and Evolving, is a well-known
classification method for skin lesions, but most deep learning mechanisms treat
it as a black box, as most of the human interpretable features are not
explained. In this work, we propose a deep learning framework that both
classifies skin lesions into categories and also quantifies scores for each
ABCD feature. It simulates the evolution of these features over time in order
to represent the E aspect, opening more windows for future exploration. The A,
B, C, and D values are quantified particularly within this work. Moreover, this
framework also visualizes ABCD feature trajectories in latent space as skin
lesions evolve from benign nevuses to malignant melanoma. The experiments are
conducted using the HAM10000 dataset that contains around ten thousand images
of skin lesions of varying stages. In summary, the classification worked with
an accuracy of around 89 percent, with melanoma AUC being 0.96, while the
feature evaluation performed well in predicting asymmetry, color variation, and
diameter, though border irregularity remains more difficult to model. Overall,
this work provides a deep learning framework that will allow doctors to link ML
diagnoses to clinically relevant criteria, thus improving our understanding of
skin cancer progression.

TL;DR: RealDPO is a novel alignment paradigm that uses real-world videos as positive samples for preference learning to improve complex motion synthesis in video generation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generative models struggle with producing natural, smooth, and contextually consistent complex motions, limiting their practical applicability.

Method: RealDPO employs Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with a tailored loss function that contrasts real-world videos with erroneous model outputs, enabling iterative self-correction. The method is supported by RealAction-5K, a curated dataset of high-quality videos capturing human daily activities.

Result: Extensive experiments show RealDPO significantly improves video quality, text alignment, and motion realism compared to state-of-the-art models and existing preference optimization techniques.

Conclusion: RealDPO effectively addresses the challenge of complex motion synthesis in video generation by leveraging real-world data for preference learning, enabling more accurate and realistic motion generation.

Abstract: Video generative models have recently achieved notable advancements in
synthesis quality. However, generating complex motions remains a critical
challenge, as existing models often struggle to produce natural, smooth, and
contextually consistent movements. This gap between generated and real-world
motions limits their practical applicability. To address this issue, we
introduce RealDPO, a novel alignment paradigm that leverages real-world data as
positive samples for preference learning, enabling more accurate motion
synthesis. Unlike traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which offers
limited corrective feedback, RealDPO employs Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) with a tailored loss function to enhance motion realism. By contrasting
real-world videos with erroneous model outputs, RealDPO enables iterative
self-correction, progressively refining motion quality. To support
post-training in complex motion synthesis, we propose RealAction-5K, a curated
dataset of high-quality videos capturing human daily activities with rich and
precise motion details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RealDPO
significantly improves video quality, text alignment, and motion realism
compared to state-of-the-art models and existing preference optimization
techniques.

*Mihai-Cristian Pîrvu,Marius Leordeanu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for combining multiple visual modalities with minimal human supervision using pre-trained experts and procedural combinations, achieving competitive results with significantly fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The real world is multi-modal but traditional ML models are unimodal. Recent bi-modal approaches are insufficient for true world understanding, requiring integration of all independent modalities.

Method: Use pre-trained experts and procedural combinations on raw videos through an autonomous data-pipeline, leveraging PHG-MAE model designed for multi-modal data with efficient distillation to <1M parameters.

Result: Achieved competitive results compared to models with ~300M parameters, enabling real-time semantic segmentation on commodity hardware and near real-time depth estimation.

Conclusion: Multi-modal integration with minimal supervision is feasible and effective, with compact models performing competitively against much larger counterparts for real-time applications.

Abstract: The real-world is inherently multi-modal at its core. Our tools observe and
take snapshots of it, in digital form, such as videos or sounds, however much
of it is lost. Similarly for actions and information passing between humans,
languages are used as a written form of communication. Traditionally, Machine
Learning models have been unimodal (i.e. rgb -> semantic or text ->
sentiment_class). Recent trends go towards bi-modality, where images and text
are learned together, however, in order to truly understand the world, we need
to integrate all these independent modalities. In this work we try to combine
as many visual modalities as we can using little to no human supervision. In
order to do this, we use pre-trained experts and procedural combinations
between them on top of raw videos using a fully autonomous data-pipeline, which
we also open-source. We then make use of PHG-MAE, a model specifically designed
to leverage multi-modal data. We show that this model which was efficiently
distilled into a low-parameter (<1M) can have competitive results compared to
models of ~300M parameters. We deploy this model and analyze the use-case of
real-time semantic segmentation from handheld devices or webcams on commodity
hardware. Finally, we deploy other off-the-shelf models using the same
framework, such as DPT for near real-time depth estimation.

*Shizun Wang,Zhenxiang Jiang,Xingyi Yang,Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C4D is a framework that extends 3D reconstruction to 4D by leveraging temporal correspondences (optical flow and point tracking) to handle dynamic scenes, enabling joint estimation of dynamic geometry and camera poses from monocular video.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D reconstruction methods fail on dynamic scenes because moving objects violate multi-view geometric constraints, leading to inaccurate results. There's a need to extend static scene reconstruction to handle dynamic content.

Method: C4D captures short-term optical flow and long-term point tracking, trains a dynamic-aware point tracker to identify moving elements, and introduces dynamic scene optimization objectives to recover 3D geometry and camera parameters while lifting 2D trajectories to smooth 3D trajectories.

Result: The framework achieves complete 4D recovery and demonstrates strong performance in depth estimation, camera pose estimation, and point tracking across multiple downstream tasks.

Conclusion: C4D successfully extends 3D reconstruction to dynamic scenes by leveraging temporal correspondences, enabling robust 4D reconstruction from monocular video with applications in various computer vision tasks.

Abstract: Recovering 4D from monocular video, which jointly estimates dynamic geometry
and camera poses, is an inevitably challenging problem. While recent
pointmap-based 3D reconstruction methods (e.g., DUSt3R) have made great
progress in reconstructing static scenes, directly applying them to dynamic
scenes leads to inaccurate results. This discrepancy arises because moving
objects violate multi-view geometric constraints, disrupting the
reconstruction. To address this, we introduce C4D, a framework that leverages
temporal Correspondences to extend existing 3D reconstruction formulation to
4D. Specifically, apart from predicting pointmaps, C4D captures two types of
correspondences: short-term optical flow and long-term point tracking. We train
a dynamic-aware point tracker that provides additional mobility information,
facilitating the estimation of motion masks to separate moving elements from
the static background, thus offering more reliable guidance for dynamic scenes.
Furthermore, we introduce a set of dynamic scene optimization objectives to
recover per-frame 3D geometry and camera parameters. Simultaneously, the
correspondences lift 2D trajectories into smooth 3D trajectories, enabling
fully integrated 4D reconstruction. Experiments show that our framework
achieves complete 4D recovery and demonstrates strong performance across
multiple downstream tasks, including depth estimation, camera pose estimation,
and point tracking. Project Page: https://littlepure2333.github.io/C4D

*Guangyi Han,Wei Zhai,Yuhang Yang,Yang Cao,Zheng-Jun Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Free-Form HOI Generation to create diverse hand-object interactions beyond fixed grasping patterns, using a multi-level diffusion model with fine-grained semantic control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HOI research is limited to fixed grasping patterns tied to physical priors, failing to capture the diversity of daily hand-object interactions like pushing, poking, and rotating.

Method: Proposed TOUCH framework: three-stage approach with multi-level diffusion model using explicit contact modeling for conditioning, refined with contact consistency and physical constraints. Built on WildO2 dataset containing 4.4k unique interactions across 92 intents and 610 object categories.

Result: Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the method's ability to generate controllable, diverse, and physically plausible hand interactions representative of daily activities.

Conclusion: The approach successfully extends HOI from grasping to free-form interactions, enabling fine-grained semantic control to generate versatile hand poses beyond traditional grasping priors.

Abstract: Hand-object interaction (HOI) is fundamental for humans to express intent.
Existing HOI generation research is predominantly confined to fixed grasping
patterns, where control is tied to physical priors such as force closure or
generic intent instructions, even when expressed through elaborate language.
Such an overly general conditioning imposes a strong inductive bias for stable
grasps, thus failing to capture the diversity of daily HOI. To address these
limitations, we introduce Free-Form HOI Generation, which aims to generate
controllable, diverse, and physically plausible HOI conditioned on fine-grained
intent, extending HOI from grasping to free-form interactions, like pushing,
poking, and rotating. To support this task, we construct WildO2, an in-the-wild
diverse 3D HOI dataset, which includes diverse HOI derived from internet
videos. Specifically, it contains 4.4k unique interactions across 92 intents
and 610 object categories, each with detailed semantic annotations. Building on
this dataset, we propose TOUCH, a three-stage framework centered on a
multi-level diffusion model that facilitates fine-grained semantic control to
generate versatile hand poses beyond grasping priors. This process leverages
explicit contact modeling for conditioning and is subsequently refined with
contact consistency and physical constraints to ensure realism. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate our method's ability to generate controllable, diverse,
and physically plausible hand interactions representative of daily activities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BADAS is a family of collision prediction models that specifically focuses on ego-vehicle threats rather than random accidents, trained on Nexar's real-world dashcam dataset and achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing collision prediction methods fail to distinguish between ego-vehicle threats and random accidents not involving the ego vehicle, leading to excessive false alerts in real-world deployment.

Method: BADAS uses a V-JEPA2 backbone trained end-to-end, comes in two variants (BADAS-Open trained on 1.5k public videos and BADAS1.0 trained on 40k proprietary videos), and involves re-annotating major benchmarks to identify ego involvement with consensus alert-time labels.

Result: BADAS achieves state-of-the-art AP/AUC across DAD, DADA-2000, DoTA, and Nexar datasets, outperforms forward-collision ADAS baseline, and produces more realistic time-to-accident estimates.

Conclusion: The authors release BADAS-Open model weights, code, and re-annotations of all evaluation datasets to promote ego-centric collision prediction research.

Abstract: Existing collision prediction methods often fail to distinguish between
ego-vehicle threats and random accidents not involving the ego vehicle, leading

*Hengyuan Xu,Wei Cheng,Peng Xing,Yixiao Fang,Shuhan Wu,Rui Wang,Xianfang Zeng,Daxin Jiang,Gang Yu,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the copy-paste problem in identity-consistent text-to-image generation by creating a large-scale dataset, introducing a benchmark, and proposing a contrastive identity loss method, resulting in the WithAnyone model that reduces artifacts while maintaining identity fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current identity-consistent generation models suffer from copy-paste artifacts where they directly replicate reference faces instead of preserving identity across natural variations in pose, expression, or lighting, which limits controllability and expressive power.

Method: Constructed MultiID-2M dataset for multi-person scenarios, introduced a benchmark to quantify copy-paste artifacts and fidelity-variation trade-off, and proposed a training paradigm with contrastive identity loss using paired data.

Result: WithAnyone model significantly reduces copy-paste artifacts, improves controllability over pose and expression, maintains strong perceptual quality, and achieves high identity fidelity while enabling expressive controllable generation.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively mitigates copy-paste problems in identity-consistent generation while preserving identity similarity, as validated through extensive experiments and user studies.

Abstract: Identity-consistent generation has become an important focus in text-to-image
research, with recent models achieving notable success in producing images
aligned with a reference identity. Yet, the scarcity of large-scale paired
datasets containing multiple images of the same individual forces most
approaches to adopt reconstruction-based training. This reliance often leads to
a failure mode we term copy-paste, where the model directly replicates the
reference face rather than preserving identity across natural variations in
pose, expression, or lighting. Such over-similarity undermines controllability
and limits the expressive power of generation. To address these limitations, we
(1) construct a large-scale paired dataset MultiID-2M, tailored for
multi-person scenarios, providing diverse references for each identity; (2)
introduce a benchmark that quantifies both copy-paste artifacts and the
trade-off between identity fidelity and variation; and (3) propose a novel
training paradigm with a contrastive identity loss that leverages paired data
to balance fidelity with diversity. These contributions culminate in
WithAnyone, a diffusion-based model that effectively mitigates copy-paste while
preserving high identity similarity. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that WithAnyone significantly reduces copy-paste
artifacts, improves controllability over pose and expression, and maintains
strong perceptual quality. User studies further validate that our method
achieves high identity fidelity while enabling expressive controllable
generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScaleWeaver is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework for visual autoregressive models that enables high-fidelity controllable text-to-image generation through improved MMDiT blocks with Reference Attention, achieving precise control while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While visual autoregressive models have advanced text-to-image generation, control mechanisms for precise and flexible generation within this paradigm remain underexplored compared to diffusion models.

Method: Proposes ScaleWeaver framework with improved MMDiT blocks featuring Reference Attention module that efficiently incorporates conditional information by discarding unnecessary image→condition attention, emphasizing parameter reuse, and using zero-initialized linear projection to preserve base model capabilities.

Result: Extensive experiments show ScaleWeaver delivers high-quality generation with precise control while achieving superior efficiency over diffusion-based methods.

Conclusion: ScaleWeaver provides a practical and effective solution for controllable text-to-image generation within the visual autoregressive paradigm, balancing quality, control precision, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation with visual autoregressive~(VAR) models has recently
achieved impressive advances in generation fidelity and inference efficiency.
While control mechanisms have been explored for diffusion models, enabling
precise and flexible control within VAR paradigm remains underexplored. To
bridge this critical gap, in this paper, we introduce ScaleWeaver, a novel
framework designed to achieve high-fidelity, controllable generation upon
advanced VAR models through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The core module in
ScaleWeaver is the improved MMDiT block with the proposed Reference Attention
module, which efficiently and effectively incorporates conditional information.
Different from MM Attention, the proposed Reference Attention module discards
the unnecessary attention from image$\rightarrow$condition, reducing
computational cost while stabilizing control injection. Besides, it
strategically emphasizes parameter reuse, leveraging the capability of the VAR
backbone itself with a few introduced parameters to process control
information, and equipping a zero-initialized linear projection to ensure that
control signals are incorporated effectively without disrupting the generative
capability of the base model. Extensive experiments show that ScaleWeaver
delivers high-quality generation and precise control while attaining superior
efficiency over diffusion-based methods, making ScaleWeaver a practical and
effective solution for controllable text-to-image generation within the visual
autoregressive paradigm. Code and models will be released.

TL;DR: Terra is a native 3D world model that represents and generates explorable environments using intrinsic 3D latent space, achieving state-of-the-art performance with high 3D consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing world models rely on pixel-aligned representations that neglect the inherent 3D nature of the physical world, undermining 3D consistency and modeling efficiency.

Method: Proposes P2G-VAE to encode 3D inputs into latent point representation decoded as 3D Gaussian primitives, and SPFlow network for generating latent point representation by denoising positions and features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction and generation on ScanNet v2 indoor scenes with high 3D consistency, enabling exact multi-view consistency and flexible rendering from any viewpoint.

Conclusion: Terra demonstrates that native 3D representation enables explorable world modeling with superior 3D consistency compared to pixel-aligned approaches.

Abstract: World models have garnered increasing attention for comprehensive modeling of
the real world. However, most existing methods still rely on pixel-aligned
representations as the basis for world evolution, neglecting the inherent 3D
nature of the physical world. This could undermine the 3D consistency and
diminish the modeling efficiency of world models. In this paper, we present
Terra, a native 3D world model that represents and generates explorable
environments in an intrinsic 3D latent space. Specifically, we propose a novel
point-to-Gaussian variational autoencoder (P2G-VAE) that encodes 3D inputs into
a latent point representation, which is subsequently decoded as 3D Gaussian
primitives to jointly model geometry and appearance. We then introduce a sparse
point flow matching network (SPFlow) for generating the latent point
representation, which simultaneously denoises the positions and features of the
point latents. Our Terra enables exact multi-view consistency with native 3D
representation and architecture, and supports flexible rendering from any
viewpoint with only a single generation process. Furthermore, Terra achieves
explorable world modeling through progressive generation in the point latent
space. We conduct extensive experiments on the challenging indoor scenes from
ScanNet v2. Terra achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction
and generation with high 3D consistency.

TL;DR: nlg2choice is a two-stage method that first asks MLLMs open-ended questions for fine-grained visual classification tasks, then uses text-only constrained decoding to predict the most likely choice from hundreds to thousands of highly related options.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods struggle with free-form responses from auto-regressive models in fine-grained visual classification, especially with multiple choice questions beyond 5-way options and retrieval-based problems where computing probabilities over large choice sets is computationally expensive.

Method: A two-stage approach: (1) ask MLLM open-ended questions with minimal constraints, (2) use text-only constrained decoding to predict the most likely choice. For retrieval settings, compute probability of constrained response with early stopping to improve throughput.

Result: The method shows improvement over seven fine-grained visual datasets in both classification and retrieval tasks, and maintains performance across various natural language task implementations.

Conclusion: nlg2choice effectively addresses the challenges of evaluating free-form responses in fine-grained visual classification with large choice sets, providing computational efficiency through early stopping while maintaining strong performance across different task formulations.

Abstract: Despite the renewed interest in zero-shot visual classification due to the
rise of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the problem of evaluating
free-form responses of auto-regressive models remains a persistent challenge.
Most existing works focus on language-only tasks or don't consider Multiple
Choice Questions (MCQs) beyond 5-way options, both of which are critical
capabilities to solve tasks in Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) where
choice counts are in the hundreds to thousands and the choices are highly
related. Furthermore, in this highly multi-way MCQ setting it is not clear how
to extend LLM choice extraction to retrieval-based problems, where computing
probabilities over the choice set is computationally costly. In this work we
investigate nlg2choice, a simple two-stage method which first asks the MLLM an
open-ended question for the task with minimal constraints, then uses text-only
constrained decoding to predict the most likely choice. In retrieval settings,
we compute the probability of the constrained response taking that choice with
an early stopping method to significantly improve throughput. Our results show
improvement over a suite of seven fine-grained visual datasets when evaluating
in terms of classification and retrieval, and show that this performance holds
over the various ways that users of LLMs can implement tasks in natural
language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of modular VLMs and make native VLM research more accessible by clarifying fundamental constraints and providing guiding principles for constructing unified vision-language models.

Method: Developed NEO family of native VLMs using three core primitives: (1) aligning pixel and word representations in shared semantic space, (2) integrating strengths of separate vision and language modules, (3) embodying cross-modal properties for unified encoding, aligning, and reasoning.

Result: NEO achieves competitive performance against top-tier modular VLMs across diverse real-world scenarios while efficiently developing visual perception from scratch with only 390M image-text examples, mitigating vision-language conflicts in a dense monolithic model.

Conclusion: NEO serves as a cornerstone for scalable and powerful native VLMs, providing reusable components that foster a cost-effective and extensible ecosystem for advancing unified vision-language modeling.

Abstract: The edifice of native Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has emerged as a rising
contender to typical modular VLMs, shaped by evolving model architectures and
training paradigms. Yet, two lingering clouds cast shadows over its widespread
exploration and promotion: (-) What fundamental constraints set native VLMs
apart from modular ones, and to what extent can these barriers be overcome? (-)
How to make research in native VLMs more accessible and democratized, thereby
accelerating progress in the field. In this paper, we clarify these challenges
and outline guiding principles for constructing native VLMs. Specifically, one
native VLM primitive should: (i) effectively align pixel and word
representations within a shared semantic space; (ii) seamlessly integrate the
strengths of formerly separate vision and language modules; (iii) inherently
embody various cross-modal properties that support unified vision-language
encoding, aligning, and reasoning. Hence, we launch NEO, a novel family of
native VLMs built from first principles, capable of rivaling top-tier modular
counterparts across diverse real-world scenarios. With only 390M image-text
examples, NEO efficiently develops visual perception from scratch while
mitigating vision-language conflicts inside a dense and monolithic model
crafted from our elaborate primitives. We position NEO as a cornerstone for
scalable and powerful native VLMs, paired with a rich set of reusable
components that foster a cost-effective and extensible ecosystem. Our code and

TL;DR: A novel semi-supervised video anomaly detection framework using Multimodal Large Language Models to analyze object activities and interactions over time, providing explainability and state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semi-supervised VAD methods struggle with complex anomalies involving object interactions and lack explainability, motivating the need for a more interpretable approach.

Method: Uses MLLMs to generate textual descriptions of object activities and interactions from nominal videos by querying with visual inputs of object pairs at different moments, then compares test videos to these textual descriptions for anomaly detection.

Result: Effectively detects complex interaction-based anomalies and achieves state-of-the-art performance on datasets without interaction anomalies, while providing inherent explainability.

Conclusion: The proposed MLLM-based framework successfully addresses limitations of existing VAD methods by focusing on object activity interpretation, enabling detection of complex anomalies and providing explainable results that can enhance traditional VAD methods.

Abstract: Existing semi-supervised video anomaly detection (VAD) methods often struggle
with detecting complex anomalies involving object interactions and generally
lack explainability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel VAD
framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Unlike previous
MLLM-based approaches that make direct anomaly judgments at the frame level,
our method focuses on extracting and interpreting object activity and
interactions over time. By querying an MLLM with visual inputs of object pairs
at different moments, we generate textual descriptions of the activity and
interactions from nominal videos. These textual descriptions serve as a
high-level representation of the activity and interactions of objects in a
video. They are used to detect anomalies during test time by comparing them to
textual descriptions found in nominal training videos. Our approach inherently
provides explainability and can be combined with many traditional VAD methods
to further enhance their interpretability. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method not only detects complex interaction-based
anomalies effectively but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on
datasets without interaction anomalies.

TL;DR: A diffusion sampling method for multi-view consistent image editing using pre-trained 2D models, avoiding explicit 3D optimization through implicit 3D regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 2D image editing models produce high-quality edits but lack consistency across multiple views of 3D scenes, while current 3D approaches suffer from slow optimization and instability with sparse views.

Method: Coupled diffusion sampling that concurrently samples from multi-view image distribution and 2D edited image distribution, using a coupling term to enforce multi-view consistency.

Result: Validated on three distinct multi-view image editing tasks, showing effectiveness and generality across various model architectures.

Conclusion: The framework provides a general solution for multi-view consistent editing that works with existing 2D models without requiring explicit 3D optimization.

Abstract: We present an inference-time diffusion sampling method to perform multi-view
consistent image editing using pre-trained 2D image editing models. These
models can independently produce high-quality edits for each image in a set of
multi-view images of a 3D scene or object, but they do not maintain consistency
across views. Existing approaches typically address this by optimizing over
explicit 3D representations, but they suffer from a lengthy optimization
process and instability under sparse view settings. We propose an implicit 3D
regularization approach by constraining the generated 2D image sequences to
adhere to a pre-trained multi-view image distribution. This is achieved through
coupled diffusion sampling, a simple diffusion sampling technique that
concurrently samples two trajectories from both a multi-view image distribution
and a 2D edited image distribution, using a coupling term to enforce the
multi-view consistency among the generated images. We validate the
effectiveness and generality of this framework on three distinct multi-view
image editing tasks, demonstrating its applicability across various model
architectures and highlighting its potential as a general solution for
multi-view consistent editing.

TL;DR: 3DScenePrompt is a framework for video generation that uses dual spatio-temporal conditioning and a 3D scene memory to enable precise camera control while maintaining scene consistency across long video sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation methods are limited by conditioning on single images or short clips, which struggle with maintaining scene consistency and precise camera control over longer sequences, especially when dynamic elements need to evolve naturally.

Method: Uses dual spatio-temporal conditioning with temporally adjacent frames for motion continuity and spatially adjacent content for scene consistency. Introduces a 3D scene memory that represents static geometry extracted from input video using dynamic SLAM with dynamic masking to separate static scene from moving elements.

Result: The framework significantly outperforms existing methods in scene consistency, camera controllability, and generation quality, enabling long-range spatial coherence without sacrificing computational efficiency or motion realism.

Conclusion: 3DScenePrompt successfully addresses the challenge of maintaining scene consistency and precise camera control in long video generation by leveraging 3D scene representations and dual conditioning strategies.

Abstract: We present 3DScenePrompt, a framework that generates the next video chunk
from arbitrary-length input while enabling precise camera control and
preserving scene consistency. Unlike methods conditioned on a single image or a
short clip, we employ dual spatio-temporal conditioning that reformulates
context-view referencing across the input video. Our approach conditions on
both temporally adjacent frames for motion continuity and spatially adjacent
content for scene consistency. However, when generating beyond temporal
boundaries, directly using spatially adjacent frames would incorrectly preserve
dynamic elements from the past. We address this by introducing a 3D scene
memory that represents exclusively the static geometry extracted from the
entire input video. To construct this memory, we leverage dynamic SLAM with our
newly introduced dynamic masking strategy that explicitly separates static
scene geometry from moving elements. The static scene representation can then
be projected to any target viewpoint, providing geometrically consistent warped
views that serve as strong 3D spatial prompts while allowing dynamic regions to
evolve naturally from temporal context. This enables our model to maintain
long-range spatial coherence and precise camera control without sacrificing
computational efficiency or motion realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in scene
consistency, camera controllability, and generation quality. Project page :

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A continuous masked autoregressive motion transformer with gated linear attention and RMSNorm is proposed for whole-body multi-modal human motion generation, outperforming previous methods across text-to-motion, speech-to-gesture, and music-to-dance tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in whole-body multi-modal human motion generation: creating effective motion generation mechanisms and integrating various modalities (text, speech, music) into a cohesive framework, overcoming limitations of previous discrete masked modeling or autoregressive approaches.

Method: Developed a continuous masked autoregressive motion transformer with causal attention for sequential human motion. Introduced gated linear attention and RMSNorm to focus on key actions and suppress instability. Used DiT structure for diffusion-based condition propagation, and leveraged AdaLN and cross-attention to fuse text, speech, and music modalities.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the framework outperforms previous methods across all modalities, including text-to-motion, speech-to-gesture, and music-to-dance tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed continuous masked autoregressive motion transformer with multimodal fusion capabilities effectively addresses whole-body human motion generation challenges and shows superior performance across multiple modalities.

Abstract: Whole-body multi-modal human motion generation poses two primary challenges:
creating an effective motion generation mechanism and integrating various
modalities, such as text, speech, and music, into a cohesive framework. Unlike
previous methods that usually employ discrete masked modeling or autoregressive
modeling, we develop a continuous masked autoregressive motion transformer,
where a causal attention is performed considering the sequential nature within
the human motion. Within this transformer, we introduce a gated linear
attention and an RMSNorm module, which drive the transformer to pay attention
to the key actions and suppress the instability caused by either the abnormal
movements or the heterogeneous distributions within multi-modalities. To
further enhance both the motion generation and the multimodal generalization,
we employ the DiT structure to diffuse the conditions from the transformer
towards the targets. To fuse different modalities, AdaLN and cross-attention
are leveraged to inject the text, speech, and music signals. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework outperforms previous methods across all
modalities, including text-to-motion, speech-to-gesture, and music-to-dance.
The code of our method will be made public.

TL;DR: MathCanvas is a framework that enables Large Multimodal Models to perform visual chain-of-thought reasoning for mathematical problems through diagram generation and strategic visual-textual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with mathematical domains like geometry that require visual aids, and existing VCoT approaches are limited by rigid tools or poor diagram quality.

Method: Two-phase approach: 1) Visual Manipulation pre-training on 15.2M caption-to-diagram pairs and editing trajectories, 2) Strategic Visual-Aided Reasoning fine-tuning on 219K interleaved visual-textual reasoning examples.

Result: BAGEL-Canvas model achieves 86% relative improvement over strong LMM baselines on MathCanvas-Bench and shows excellent generalization to other math benchmarks.

Conclusion: MathCanvas provides a complete toolkit to unlock complex visual-aided reasoning in LMMs, bridging the gap between textual and visual mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in textual reasoning, they
struggle with mathematical domains like geometry that intrinsically rely on
visual aids. Existing approaches to Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) are often
limited by rigid external tools or fail to generate the high-fidelity,
strategically-timed diagrams necessary for complex problem-solving. To bridge
this gap, we introduce MathCanvas, a comprehensive framework designed to endow
unified Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with intrinsic VCoT capabilities for
mathematics. Our approach consists of two phases. First, a Visual Manipulation
stage pre-trains the model on a novel 15.2M-pair corpus, comprising 10M
caption-to-diagram pairs (MathCanvas-Imagen) and 5.2M step-by-step editing
trajectories (MathCanvas-Edit), to master diagram generation and editing.
Second, a Strategic Visual-Aided Reasoning stage fine-tunes the model on
MathCanvas-Instruct, a new 219K-example dataset of interleaved visual-textual
reasoning paths, teaching it when and how to leverage visual aids. To
facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce MathCanvas-Bench, a challenging
benchmark with 3K problems that require models to produce interleaved
visual-textual solutions. Our model, BAGEL-Canvas, trained under this
framework, achieves an 86% relative improvement over strong LMM baselines on
MathCanvas-Bench, demonstrating excellent generalization to other public math
benchmarks. Our work provides a complete toolkit-framework, datasets, and
benchmark-to unlock complex, human-like visual-aided reasoning in LMMs. Project

### [98] [RainDiff: End-to-end Precipitation Nowcasting Via Token-wise Attention Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14962)
*Thao Nguyen,Jiaqi Ma,Fahad Shahbaz Khan,Souhaib Ben Taieb,Salman Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel diffusion-based precipitation nowcasting method that integrates Token-wise Attention into both U-Net and spatio-temporal encoder to capture multi-scale spatial interactions and temporal evolution, overcoming scalability issues of existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of current diffusion-based precipitation nowcasting models that suffer from scalability issues - latent-space approaches require separate autoencoders adding complexity, while pixel-space approaches are computationally intensive and lack attention mechanisms for long-range dependencies.

Method: Proposes Token-wise Attention integrated into U-Net diffusion model and spatio-temporal encoder to dynamically capture multi-scale spatial interactions and temporal evolution, eliminating need for separate latent modules while maintaining computational efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior local fidelity, generalization, and robustness in complex precipitation forecasting scenarios across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed attention-integrated diffusion model provides an effective solution for precipitation nowcasting that balances computational efficiency with the ability to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies, demonstrating strong performance improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting, predicting future radar echo sequences from current
observations, is a critical yet challenging task due to the inherently chaotic
and tightly coupled spatio-temporal dynamics of the atmosphere. While recent
advances in diffusion-based models attempt to capture both large-scale motion
and fine-grained stochastic variability, they often suffer from scalability
issues: latent-space approaches require a separately trained autoencoder,
adding complexity and limiting generalization, while pixel-space approaches are
computationally intensive and often omit attention mechanisms, reducing their
ability to model long-range spatio-temporal dependencies. To address these
limitations, we propose a Token-wise Attention integrated into not only the
U-Net diffusion model but also the spatio-temporal encoder that dynamically
captures multi-scale spatial interactions and temporal evolution. Unlike prior
approaches, our method natively integrates attention into the architecture
without incurring the high resource cost typical of pixel-space diffusion,
thereby eliminating the need for separate latent modules. Our extensive
experiments and visual evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate that the
proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, yielding
superior local fidelity, generalization, and robustness in complex
precipitation forecasting scenarios.

*Miao Hu,Zhiwei Huang,Tai Wang,Jiangmiao Pang,Dahua Lin,Nanning Zheng,Runsen Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChangingGrounding, the first benchmark for 3D visual grounding in changing scenes, and proposes Mem-ChangingGrounder, a zero-shot method that uses memory-driven exploration and multi-view fusion to localize objects efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world robots need to localize objects from natural language in changing environments, but existing 3DVG methods assume static, up-to-date point clouds which require costly re-scans and hinder practical deployment.

Method: Proposes Mem-ChangingGrounder, a zero-shot method that: 1) identifies object type from query, 2) retrieves relevant memories to guide actions, 3) explores target efficiently, 4) falls back when previous operations are invalid, 5) performs multi-view scanning, and 6) projects fused evidence to get accurate bounding boxes.

Result: Mem-ChangingGrounder achieves the highest localization accuracy on the ChangingGrounding benchmark while significantly reducing exploration cost compared to other baselines.

Conclusion: The benchmark and method aim to catalyze a shift toward practical, memory-centric 3DVG research for real-world applications where scenes are dynamic and costly re-scans should be avoided.

Abstract: Real-world robots localize objects from natural-language instructions while
scenes around them keep changing. Yet most of the existing 3D visual grounding
(3DVG) method still assumes a reconstructed and up-to-date point cloud, an
assumption that forces costly re-scans and hinders deployment. We argue that
3DVG should be formulated as an active, memory-driven problem, and we introduce
ChangingGrounding, the first benchmark that explicitly measures how well an
agent can exploit past observations, explore only where needed, and still
deliver precise 3D boxes in changing scenes. To set a strong reference point,
we also propose Mem-ChangingGrounder, a zero-shot method for this task that
marries cross-modal retrieval with lightweight multi-view fusion: it identifies
the object type implied by the query, retrieves relevant memories to guide
actions, then explores the target efficiently in the scene, falls back when
previous operations are invalid, performs multi-view scanning of the target,
and projects the fused evidence from multi-view scans to get accurate object
bounding boxes. We evaluate different baselines on ChangingGrounding, and our
Mem-ChangingGrounder achieves the highest localization accuracy while greatly
reducing exploration cost. We hope this benchmark and method catalyze a shift
toward practical, memory-centric 3DVG research for real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new training paradigm for image editing that eliminates the need for paired data by directly optimizing diffusion models using vision-language model feedback and distribution matching loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image editing models rely on supervised fine-tuning with large datasets of input-target pairs, which are hard to curate at scale. Synthetic training pairs can propagate artifacts from pretrained models.

Method: Directly optimizes few-step diffusion models by unrolling during training and leveraging feedback from VLMs. Uses VLM evaluation for instruction following and content preservation, with distribution matching loss (DMD) for visual fidelity.

Result: Performs on par with supervised diffusion models trained on extensive paired data in few-step settings, and outperforms RL-based techniques like Flow-GRPO when using the same VLM as reward model.

Conclusion: The proposed training paradigm successfully eliminates the need for paired data while achieving competitive performance with supervised methods, offering a scalable alternative for image editing model training.

Abstract: Recent image editing models have achieved impressive results while following
natural language editing instructions, but they rely on supervised fine-tuning
with large datasets of input-target pairs. This is a critical bottleneck, as
such naturally occurring pairs are hard to curate at scale. Current workarounds
use synthetic training pairs that leverage the zero-shot capabilities of
existing models. However, this can propagate and magnify the artifacts of the
pretrained model into the final trained model. In this work, we present a new
training paradigm that eliminates the need for paired data entirely. Our
approach directly optimizes a few-step diffusion model by unrolling it during
training and leveraging feedback from vision-language models (VLMs). For each
input and editing instruction, the VLM evaluates if an edit follows the
instruction and preserves unchanged content, providing direct gradients for
end-to-end optimization. To ensure visual fidelity, we incorporate distribution
matching loss (DMD), which constrains generated images to remain within the
image manifold learned by pretrained models. We evaluate our method on standard
benchmarks and include an extensive ablation study. Without any paired data,
our method performs on par with various image editing diffusion models trained
on extensive supervised paired data, under the few-step setting. Given the same
VLM as the reward model, we also outperform RL-based techniques like Flow-GRPO.

*Raheleh Biglari,Joachim Denil*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces DOTechnique, a novel method for determining model validity based on decision consistency rather than output similarity, enabling efficient identification of validity regions without predefined boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model validity is critical for decision-making, but traditional approaches rely on predefined validity frames that may be unavailable or insufficient.

Method: DOTechnique evaluates whether surrogate models lead to equivalent decisions compared to high-fidelity models, integrating domain constraints and symbolic reasoning to narrow search space.

Result: Demonstrated on a highway lane change system, successfully uncovering the validity region of a simulation model.

Conclusion: DOTechnique shows potential to support finding model validity through decision-maker context, offering a practical alternative to traditional validity assessment methods.

Abstract: Model validity is as critical as the model itself, especially when guiding
decision-making processes. Traditional approaches often rely on predefined
validity frames, which may not always be available or sufficient. This paper
introduces the Decision Oriented Technique (DOTechnique), a novel method for
determining model validity based on decision consistency rather than output
similarity. By evaluating whether surrogate models lead to equivalent decisions
compared to high-fidelity models, DOTechnique enables efficient identification
of validity regions, even in the absence of explicit validity boundaries. The
approach integrates domain constraints and symbolic reasoning to narrow the
search space, enhancing computational efficiency. A highway lane change system
serves as a motivating example, demonstrating how DOTechnique can uncover the
validity region of a simulation model. The results highlight the potential of
the technique to support finding model validity through decision-maker context.

*Supriti Sinhamahapatra,Jan Niehues*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a multi-modal ASR system that integrates visual information from presentation slides to improve speech recognition accuracy, especially for domain-specific terminology in scientific presentations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SOTA ASR systems only use acoustic information and ignore multi-modal context. Visual information from presentation slides can help disambiguate speech and adapt to domain-specific content, which is particularly important for scientific presentations.

Method: Created a benchmark for multi-modal presentations with automatic domain-specific terminology analysis. Developed data augmentation techniques to overcome dataset limitations. Trained models using augmented datasets that incorporate slide information.

Result: Achieved 34% relative reduction in word error rate overall and 35% reduction for domain-specific terms compared to baseline acoustic-only models.

Conclusion: Integrating visual information from presentation slides significantly improves ASR performance, particularly for domain-specific terminology in scientific contexts.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems primarily
rely on acoustic information while disregarding additional multi-modal context.
However, visual information are essential in disambiguation and adaptation.
While most work focus on speaker images to handle noise conditions, this work
also focuses on integrating presentation slides for the use cases of scientific
presentation.
  In a first step, we create a benchmark for multi-modal presentation including
an automatic analysis of transcribing domain-specific terminology. Next, we
explore methods for augmenting speech models with multi-modal information. We
mitigate the lack of datasets with accompanying slides by a suitable approach
of data augmentation. Finally, we train a model using the augmented dataset,
resulting in a relative reduction in word error rate of approximately 34%,
across all words and 35%, for domain-specific terms compared to the baseline
model.

*María Victoria Carro,Denise Alejandra Mester,Francisca Gauna Selasco,Giovanni Franco Gabriel Marraffini,Mario Alejandro Leiva,Gerardo I. Simari,María Vanina Martinez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Large language models systematically infer unwarranted causal relationships in null contingency scenarios, showing susceptibility to the illusion of causality bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine whether LLMs develop causal illusions similar to humans when faced with contingency judgment tasks, particularly in medical contexts where accurate causal reasoning is crucial.

Method: Constructed a dataset of 1,000 null contingency scenarios in medical contexts and prompted LLMs to evaluate the effectiveness of potential causes using the classic contingency judgment task paradigm from cognitive science.

Result: All evaluated models systematically inferred unwarranted causal relationships, revealing strong susceptibility to the illusion of causality bias.

Conclusion: The findings support the hypothesis that LLMs reproduce causal language without true comprehension, raising concerns about their use in domains requiring accurate causal reasoning for informed decision-making.

Abstract: Causal learning is the cognitive process of developing the capability of
making causal inferences based on available information, often guided by
normative principles. This process is prone to errors and biases, such as the
illusion of causality, in which people perceive a causal relationship between
two variables despite lacking supporting evidence. This cognitive bias has been
proposed to underlie many societal problems, including social prejudice,
stereotype formation, misinformation, and superstitious thinking. In this work,
we examine whether large language models are prone to developing causal
illusions when faced with a classic cognitive science paradigm: the contingency
judgment task. To investigate this, we constructed a dataset of 1,000 null
contingency scenarios (in which the available information is not sufficient to
establish a causal relationship between variables) within medical contexts and
prompted LLMs to evaluate the effectiveness of potential causes. Our findings
show that all evaluated models systematically inferred unwarranted causal
relationships, revealing a strong susceptibility to the illusion of causality.
While there is ongoing debate about whether LLMs genuinely understand causality
or merely reproduce causal language without true comprehension, our findings
support the latter hypothesis and raise concerns about the use of language
models in domains where accurate causal reasoning is essential for informed
decision-making.

*Rajesh Mangannavar,Prasad Tadepalli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GammaZero introduces an action-centric graph representation for POMDP planning that enables zero-shot generalization to larger problem sizes by learning structural patterns from small problems and applying them via graph neural networks to guide Monte Carlo tree search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing POMDP planning approaches require domain-specific neural architectures and struggle with scalability, lacking the ability to generalize across different problem sizes within a domain.

Method: Uses action-centric graph representation of belief states with graph neural networks to learn value functions and policies from expert demonstrations on small problems, then applies these learned heuristics to guide Monte Carlo tree search on larger problems.

Result: Achieves comparable performance to BetaZero on same-sized problems while enabling zero-shot generalization to problems 2-4 times larger than training instances, maintaining solution quality with reduced search requirements.

Conclusion: GammaZero provides a scalable framework for POMDP planning that generalizes across problem sizes through structural pattern learning and transfer, overcoming limitations of existing domain-specific approaches.

Abstract: We introduce an action-centric graph representation framework for learning to
guide planning in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs).
Unlike existing approaches that require domain-specific neural architectures
and struggle with scalability, GammaZero leverages a unified graph-based belief
representation that enables generalization across problem sizes within a
domain. Our key insight is that belief states can be systematically transformed
into action-centric graphs where structural patterns learned on small problems
transfer to larger instances. We employ a graph neural network with a decoder
architecture to learn value functions and policies from expert demonstrations
on computationally tractable problems, then apply these learned heuristics to
guide Monte Carlo tree search on larger problems. Experimental results on
standard POMDP benchmarks demonstrate that GammaZero achieves comparable
performance to BetaZero when trained and tested on the same-sized problems,
while uniquely enabling zero-shot generalization to problems 2-4 times larger
than those seen during training, maintaining solution quality with reduced
search requirements.

*Shriyash Upadhyay,Chaithanya Bandi,Narmeen Oozeer,Philip Quirke*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes mandating AI labs to release small analog models (scaled-down versions) of their large proprietary models to enable safety verification and innovation without full disclosure, reducing the safety-innovation tradeoff.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address concerns about the cost of AI safety regulation and the shelving of regulations due to safety-innovation tradeoffs, by finding an approach that ensures safety while promoting innovation.

Method: Mandate that large AI laboratories release small, openly accessible analog models trained similarly to and distilled from their largest proprietary models, serving as public proxies for safety verification and research.

Result: Analog models enable broad participation in safety verification, interpretability research, and algorithmic transparency without forcing full model disclosure, with safety methods developed on smaller models generalizing to frontier-scale systems.

Conclusion: This regulatory approach promises minimal additional costs while significantly contributing to public good, illustrating that deeper understanding of models relaxes the safety-innovation tradeoff and enables both safety and innovation.

Abstract: Recent proposals for regulating frontier AI models have sparked concerns
about the cost of safety regulation, and most such regulations have been
shelved due to the safety-innovation tradeoff. This paper argues for an
alternative regulatory approach that ensures AI safety while actively promoting
innovation: mandating that large AI laboratories release small, openly
accessible analog models (scaled-down versions) trained similarly to and
distilled from their largest proprietary models.
  Analog models serve as public proxies, allowing broad participation in safety
verification, interpretability research, and algorithmic transparency without
forcing labs to disclose their full-scale models. Recent research demonstrates
that safety and interpretability methods developed using these smaller models
generalize effectively to frontier-scale systems. By enabling the wider
research community to directly investigate and innovate upon accessible
analogs, our policy substantially reduces the regulatory burden and accelerates
safety advancements.
  This mandate promises minimal additional costs, leveraging reusable resources
like data and infrastructure, while significantly contributing to the public
good. Our hope is not only that this policy be adopted, but that it illustrates
a broader principle supporting fundamental research in machine learning: deeper
understanding of models relaxes the safety-innovation tradeoff and lets us have
more of both.

### [106] [Generating Fair Consensus Statements with Social Choice on Token-Level MDPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14106)
*Carter Blair,Kate Larson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-objective MDP framework for consensus statement generation that provides provable fairness guarantees using social choice theory principles, with two approaches: stochastic generation for ex-ante core stability and search-based generation for egalitarian welfare maximization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current consensus generation frameworks lack provable fairness guarantees when aggregating diverse opinions, motivating the need for a structured approach that can ensure fair outcomes across different agents' preferences.

Method: Model the task as a token-level MDP with multiple objectives (one per agent), derive token-level rewards from agent policies, and apply social choice theory principles - specifically stochastic generation for ex-ante core stability and search algorithms for egalitarian welfare maximization.

Result: Empirical experiments show that search guided by the egalitarian objective generates consensus statements with improved worst-case agent alignment compared to baseline methods, including outperforming the Habermas Machine.

Conclusion: The proposed MDP framework combined with social choice theory provides a principled approach for fair consensus generation with provable guarantees, successfully extending voting theory concepts to text generation tasks.

Abstract: Current frameworks for consensus statement generation with large language
models lack the inherent structure needed to provide provable fairness
guarantees when aggregating diverse free-form opinions. We model the task as a
multi-objective, token-level Markov Decision Process (MDP), where each
objective corresponds to an agent's preference. Token-level rewards for each
agent are derived from their policy (e.g., a personalized language model). This
approach utilizes the finding that such policies implicitly define optimal
Q-functions, providing a principled way to quantify rewards at each generation
step without a value function (Rafailov et al., 2024). This MDP formulation
creates a formal structure amenable to analysis using principles from social
choice theory. We propose two approaches grounded in social choice theory.
First, we propose a stochastic generation policy guaranteed to be in the
ex-ante core, extending core stability concepts from voting theory to text
generation. This policy is derived from an underlying distribution over
complete statements that maximizes proportional fairness (Nash Welfare).
Second, for generating a single statement, we target the maximization of
egalitarian welfare using search algorithms within the MDP framework.
Empirically, experiments using language models to instantiate agent policies
show that search guided by the egalitarian objective generates consensus
statements with improved worst-case agent alignment compared to baseline
methods, including the Habermas Machine (Tessler et al., 2024).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STEMS is a safety-constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for coordinated building energy management that integrates spatial-temporal graph learning with control barrier functions, achieving significant cost and emission reductions while ensuring operational safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building energy management is crucial for carbon reduction, occupant comfort, and cost savings. Current multi-building systems face challenges in exploiting spatial-temporal dependencies, lacking rigorous safety guarantees, and handling system complexity.

Method: STEMS combines: (1) spatial-temporal graph representation learning using GCN-Transformer fusion to capture inter-building relationships and temporal patterns, and (2) safety-constrained multi-agent RL with Control Barrier Functions for mathematical safety guarantees.

Result: STEMS achieves 21% cost reduction, 18% emission reduction, reduces safety violations from 35.1% to 5.6%, and maintains optimal comfort with only 0.13 discomfort proportion. It shows strong robustness during extreme weather and effectiveness across different building types.

Conclusion: STEMS provides an effective solution for coordinated building energy management by successfully addressing spatial-temporal dependencies and safety constraints, demonstrating superior performance and practical applicability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Building energy management is essential for achieving carbon reduction goals,
improving occupant comfort, and reducing energy costs. Coordinated building
energy management faces critical challenges in exploiting spatial-temporal
dependencies while ensuring operational safety across multi-building systems.
Current multi-building energy systems face three key challenges: insufficient
spatial-temporal information exploitation, lack of rigorous safety guarantees,
and system complexity. This paper proposes Spatial-Temporal Enhanced Safe
Multi-Agent Coordination (STEMS), a novel safety-constrained multi-agent
reinforcement learning framework for coordinated building energy management.
STEMS integrates two core components: (1) a spatial-temporal graph
representation learning framework using a GCN-Transformer fusion architecture
to capture inter-building relationships and temporal patterns, and (2) a
safety-constrained multi-agent RL algorithm incorporating Control Barrier
Functions to provide mathematical safety guarantees. Extensive experiments on
real-world building datasets demonstrate STEMS's superior performance over
existing methods, showing that STEMS achieves 21% cost reduction, 18% emission
reduction, and dramatically reduces safety violations from 35.1% to 5.6% while
maintaining optimal comfort with only 0.13 discomfort proportion. The framework
also demonstrates strong robustness during extreme weather conditions and
maintains effectiveness across different building types.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified modeling framework for agentic AI systems to address fragmentation in inter-agent communication protocols, enabling formal verification of system properties like safety, liveness, and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agentic AI systems suffer from fragmented communication protocols (MCP for tools, A2A for coordination) that create semantic gaps, preventing rigorous analysis and introducing risks like architectural misalignment and exploitable coordination issues.

Method: Proposes two foundational models: (1) host agent model formalizing the top-level entity that interacts with users and orchestrates task execution, and (2) task lifecycle model detailing states and transitions of individual sub-tasks from creation to completion.

Result: Defines 17 properties for host agents and 14 for task lifecycles categorized into liveness, safety, completeness, and fairness, expressed in temporal logic for formal verification of system behavior and detection of coordination edge cases.

Conclusion: This work presents the first rigorously grounded, domain-agnostic framework for systematic analysis, design, and deployment of correct, reliable, and robust agentic AI systems.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems, which leverage multiple autonomous agents and Large
Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly used to address complex, multi-step
tasks. The safety, security, and functionality of these systems are critical,
especially in high-stakes applications. However, the current ecosystem of
inter-agent communication is fragmented, with protocols such as the Model
Context Protocol (MCP) for tool access and the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol
for coordination being analyzed in isolation. This fragmentation creates a
semantic gap that prevents the rigorous analysis of system properties and
introduces risks such as architectural misalignment and exploitable
coordination issues. To address these challenges, we introduce a modeling
framework for agentic AI systems composed of two foundational models. The
first, the host agent model, formalizes the top-level entity that interacts
with the user, decomposes tasks, and orchestrates their execution by leveraging
external agents and tools. The second, the task lifecycle model, details the
states and transitions of individual sub-tasks from creation to completion,
providing a fine-grained view of task management and error handling. Together,
these models provide a unified semantic framework for reasoning about the
behavior of multi-AI agent systems. Grounded in this framework, we define 17
properties for the host agent and 14 for the task lifecycle, categorized into
liveness, safety, completeness, and fairness. Expressed in temporal logic,
these properties enable formal verification of system behavior, detection of
coordination edge cases, and prevention of deadlocks and security
vulnerabilities. Through this effort, we introduce the first rigorously
grounded, domain-agnostic framework for the systematic analysis, design, and
deployment of correct, reliable, and robust agentic AI systems.

*David Roqui,Adèle Cormier,nistor Grozavu,Ann Bourges*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A lightweight multimodal architecture using PerceiverIO with simplified encoders and Adaptive Barlow Twins loss achieves 76.9% accuracy in predicting cultural heritage degradation, significantly outperforming standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cultural heritage sites are degrading rapidly due to climate change, but traditional unimodal monitoring (visual inspection or environmental sensors alone) fails to capture the complex interactions between environmental stressors and material deterioration.

Method: Proposes a lightweight multimodal architecture that fuses sensor data (temperature, humidity) with visual imagery using PerceiverIO with two innovations: simplified encoders (64D latent space) to prevent overfitting on small datasets, and Adaptive Barlow Twins loss to encourage modality complementarity rather than redundancy.

Result: Achieves 76.9% accuracy on Strasbourg Cathedral data, a 43% improvement over standard multimodal architectures (VisualBERT, Transformer) and 25% over vanilla PerceiverIO. Ablation studies show sensor-only (61.5%) and image-only (46.2%) performance, confirming multimodal synergy. Optimal correlation target τ=0.3 achieves 69.2% accuracy.

Conclusion: Architectural simplicity combined with contrastive regularization enables effective multimodal learning in data-scarce heritage monitoring contexts, providing a foundation for AI-driven conservation decision support systems.

Abstract: Cultural heritage sites face accelerating degradation due to climate change,
yet tradi- tional monitoring relies on unimodal analysis (visual inspection or
environmental sen- sors alone) that fails to capture the complex interplay
between environmental stres- sors and material deterioration. We propose a
lightweight multimodal architecture that fuses sensor data (temperature,
humidity) with visual imagery to predict degradation severity at heritage
sites. Our approach adapts PerceiverIO with two key innovations: (1) simplified
encoders (64D latent space) that prevent overfitting on small datasets (n=37
training samples), and (2) Adaptive Barlow Twins loss that encourages modality
complementarity rather than redundancy. On data from Strasbourg Cathedral, our
model achieves 76.9% accu- racy, a 43% improvement over standard multimodal
architectures (VisualBERT, Trans- former) and 25% over vanilla PerceiverIO.
Ablation studies reveal that sensor-only achieves 61.5% while image-only
reaches 46.2%, confirming successful multimodal synergy. A systematic
hyperparameter study identifies an optimal moderate correlation target ({\tau}
=0.3) that balances align- ment and complementarity, achieving 69.2% accuracy
compared to other {\tau} values ({\tau} =0.1/0.5/0.7: 53.8%, {\tau} =0.9:
61.5%). This work demonstrates that architectural sim- plicity combined with
contrastive regularization enables effective multimodal learning in data-scarce
heritage monitoring contexts, providing a foundation for AI-driven con-
servation decision support systems.

Method: Uses island-based genetic algorithm for population diversity, inspiration-based crossover leveraging LLM context windows, and meta-prompting strategies for dynamic solution space exploration.

Result: CodeEvolve surpasses AlphaEvolve's performance on several challenging mathematical benchmarks from the AlphaEvolve evaluation suite.

Conclusion: The framework successfully demonstrates that open-source evolutionary coding agents can outperform closed-source alternatives, and the complete framework is released as open-source to foster collaboration.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce CodeEvolve, an open-source evolutionary coding
agent that unites Large Language Models (LLMs) with genetic algorithms to solve
complex computational problems. Our framework adapts powerful evolutionary
concepts to the LLM domain, building upon recent methods for generalized
scientific discovery. CodeEvolve employs an island-based genetic algorithm to
maintain population diversity and increase throughput, introduces a novel
inspiration-based crossover mechanism that leverages the LLMs context window to
combine features from successful solutions, and implements meta-prompting
strategies for dynamic exploration of the solution space. We conduct a rigorous
evaluation of CodeEvolve on a subset of the mathematical benchmarks used to
evaluate Google DeepMind's closed-source AlphaEvolve. Our findings show that
our method surpasses AlphaEvolve's performance on several challenging problems.
To foster collaboration and accelerate progress, we release our complete
framework as an open-source repository.

*Tian Liu,Alex Cann,Ian Colbert,Mehdi Saeedi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores combining reinforcement learning (RL) with behavior trees (BTs) to create viable NPCs for commercial video games, addressing the slow adoption of RL in gaming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite rapid RL advancements, commercial video games have been slow to adopt RL-driven NPCs. The paper aims to bridge this gap by exploring the intersection of RL with traditional behavior trees.

Method: The authors use AMD Schola plugin for training RL agents in Unreal Engine to create multi-task NPCs in a complex 3D environment inspired by "The Last of Us", with detailed methodologies for jointly training RL models with BTs.

Result: The paper demonstrates the viability of the RL+BT approach for creating NPCs with various skills in complex gaming environments.

Conclusion: The intersection of reinforcement learning with behavior trees represents a crucial juncture that can help accelerate the adoption of RL in commercial video game development.

Abstract: While the rapid advancements in the reinforcement learning (RL) research
community have been remarkable, the adoption in commercial video games remains
slow. In this paper, we outline common challenges the Game AI community faces
when using RL-driven NPCs in practice, and highlight the intersection of RL
with traditional behavior trees (BTs) as a crucial juncture to be explored
further. Although the BT+RL intersection has been suggested in several research
papers, its adoption is rare. We demonstrate the viability of this approach
using AMD Schola -- a plugin for training RL agents in Unreal Engine -- by
creating multi-task NPCs in a complex 3D environment inspired by the commercial
video game ``The Last of Us". We provide detailed methodologies for jointly
training RL models with BTs while showcasing various skills.

### [112] [JEDA: Query-Free Clinical Order Search from Ambient Dialogues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14169)
*Praphul Singh,Corey Barrett,Sumana Srivasta,Amitabh Saikia,Irfan Bulu,Sri Gadde,Krishnaram Kenthapadi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JEDA is a bi-encoder system that retrieves clinical orders directly from dialogue using domain-initialized embeddings, with both direct retrieval and query-free ambient dialogue modes for real-time clinical ordering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems rely on LLM rewriting which introduces latency, instability, and opacity, making them unsuitable for real-time clinical ordering where conversations mix explicit directives with implicit reasoning.

Method: Domain-initialized bi-encoder from PubMedBERT, fine-tuned with duplicate-safe contrastive objective using constrained LLM guidance to align heterogeneous intent expressions to shared order concepts. Includes query-free mode that encodes rolling dialogue windows.

Result: Large performance gains over base encoder and recent open embedders, with noise-resilient query-free mode that reduces sensitivity to disfluencies and ASR errors.

Conclusion: JEDA provides a fast, interpretable, LLM-free retrieval layer that links ambient clinical context to actionable orders in real time, overcoming limitations of LLM-based approaches.

Abstract: Clinical conversations mix explicit directives (order a chest X-ray) with
implicit reasoning (the cough worsened overnight, we should check for
pneumonia). Many systems rely on LLM rewriting, adding latency, instability,
and opacity that hinder real-time ordering. We present JEDA (Joint Embedding
for Direct and Ambient clinical orders), a domain-initialized bi-encoder that
retrieves canonical orders directly and, in a query-free mode, encodes a short
rolling window of ambient dialogue to trigger retrieval. Initialized from
PubMedBERT and fine-tuned with a duplicate-safe contrastive objective, JEDA
aligns heterogeneous expressions of intent to shared order concepts. Training
uses constrained LLM guidance to tie each signed order to complementary
formulations (command only, context only, command+context, context+reasoning),
producing clearer inter-order separation, tighter query extendash order
coupling, and stronger generalization. The query-free mode is noise-resilient,
reducing sensitivity to disfluencies and ASR errors by conditioning on a short
window rather than a single utterance. Deployed in practice, JEDA yields large
gains and substantially outperforms its base encoder and recent open embedders
(Linq Embed Mistral, SFR Embedding, GTE Qwen, BGE large, Embedding Gemma). The
result is a fast, interpretable, LLM-free retrieval layer that links ambient
context to actionable clinical orders in real time.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARM-FM uses foundation models to automatically generate reward machines from natural language specifications, enabling effective task decomposition and zero-shot generalization in reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning algorithms are highly sensitive to reward function specification, which limits their broad applicability. There's a need for automated, compositional reward design that leverages natural language specifications.

Method: Uses foundation models to automatically generate reward machines (automata-based formalism) from natural language specifications, associates language embeddings with each automata-state for generalization, and employs this framework for RL objective specification.

Result: Empirical evidence shows ARM-FM's effectiveness in diverse challenging environments, including demonstration of zero-shot generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: ARM-FM provides an automated framework for reward design that bridges natural language specifications with formal reward structures, enabling more accessible and generalizable reinforcement learning applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are highly sensitive to reward
function specification, which remains a central challenge limiting their broad
applicability. We present ARM-FM: Automated Reward Machines via Foundation
Models, a framework for automated, compositional reward design in RL that
leverages the high-level reasoning capabilities of foundation models (FMs).
Reward machines (RMs) -- an automata-based formalism for reward specification
-- are used as the mechanism for RL objective specification, and are
automatically constructed via the use of FMs. The structured formalism of RMs
yields effective task decompositions, while the use of FMs enables objective
specifications in natural language. Concretely, we (i) use FMs to automatically
generate RMs from natural language specifications; (ii) associate language
embeddings with each RM automata-state to enable generalization across tasks;
and (iii) provide empirical evidence of ARM-FM's effectiveness in a diverse
suite of challenging environments, including evidence of zero-shot
generalization.

### [115] [Echoes of Human Malice in Agents: Benchmarking LLMs for Multi-Turn Online Harassment Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14207)
*Trilok Padhi,Pinxian Lu,Abdulkadir Erol,Tanmay Sutar,Gauri Sharma,Mina Sonmez,Munmun De Choudhury,Ugur Kursuncu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multi-turn harassment benchmark for LLM agents, showing that jailbreak attacks significantly increase harassment success rates (95-99% vs 57-98% baseline) and reduce refusal rates to 1-2%, with closed-source models being particularly vulnerable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current jailbreak research focuses on single-turn prompts, but real harassment occurs over multi-turn interactions, creating a gap in understanding LLM agent vulnerabilities in realistic harassment scenarios.

Method: Created Online Harassment Agentic Benchmark with: synthetic multi-turn harassment dataset, multi-agent simulation using game theory, three jailbreak methods (memory, planning, fine-tuning), and mixed-methods evaluation on LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct and Gemini-2.0-flash.

Result: Jailbreak tuning dramatically increases harassment success rates (95.78-96.89% vs 57.25-64.19% baseline in Llama, 99.33% vs 98.46% in Gemini) and reduces refusal rates to 1-2%. Insults (84.9-87.8%) and flaming (81.2-85.1%) were most prevalent toxic behaviors. Closed-source models showed distinct escalation patterns and greater vulnerability.

Conclusion: Multi-turn, theory-grounded attacks not only succeed at high rates but also mimic human-like harassment dynamics, highlighting the urgent need for robust safety guardrails to protect online platforms.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are powering a growing share of interactive
web applications, yet remain vulnerable to misuse and harm. Prior jailbreak
research has largely focused on single-turn prompts, whereas real harassment
often unfolds over multi-turn interactions. In this work, we present the Online
Harassment Agentic Benchmark consisting of: (i) a synthetic multi-turn
harassment conversation dataset, (ii) a multi-agent (e.g., harasser, victim)
simulation informed by repeated game theory, (iii) three jailbreak methods
attacking agents across memory, planning, and fine-tuning, and (iv) a
mixed-methods evaluation framework. We utilize two prominent LLMs,
LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct (open-source) and Gemini-2.0-flash (closed-source). Our
results show that jailbreak tuning makes harassment nearly guaranteed with an
attack success rate of 95.78--96.89% vs. 57.25--64.19% without tuning in Llama,
and 99.33% vs. 98.46% without tuning in Gemini, while sharply reducing refusal
rate to 1-2% in both models. The most prevalent toxic behaviors are Insult with
84.9--87.8% vs. 44.2--50.8% without tuning, and Flaming with 81.2--85.1% vs.
31.5--38.8% without tuning, indicating weaker guardrails compared to sensitive
categories such as sexual or racial harassment. Qualitative evaluation further
reveals that attacked agents reproduce human-like aggression profiles, such as
Machiavellian/psychopathic patterns under planning, and narcissistic tendencies
with memory. Counterintuitively, closed-source and open-source models exhibit
distinct escalation trajectories across turns, with closed-source models
showing significant vulnerability. Overall, our findings show that multi-turn
and theory-grounded attacks not only succeed at high rates but also mimic
human-like harassment dynamics, motivating the development of robust safety
guardrails to ultimately keep online platforms safe and responsible.

TL;DR: LiveResearchBench is a benchmark of 100 expert-curated tasks requiring extensive web search and synthesis, with DeepEval providing comprehensive evaluation metrics for citation-grounded long-form reports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for deep research systems fall short on key principles: they lack user-centric tasks, don't require dynamic up-to-date information, are often ambiguous, and aren't sufficiently search-intensive.

Method: Created LiveResearchBench with 100 tasks spanning daily life, enterprise, and academia, requiring extensive real-time web search. Developed DeepEval with four complementary evaluation protocols covering content- and report-level quality metrics.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation of 17 frontier deep research systems revealed current strengths, recurring failure modes, and identified key system components needed for advancement.

Conclusion: LiveResearchBench and DeepEval provide a rigorous foundation for systematically evaluating and advancing deep research systems, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Deep research -- producing comprehensive, citation-grounded reports by
searching and synthesizing information from hundreds of live web sources --
marks an important frontier for agentic systems. To rigorously evaluate this
ability, four principles are essential: tasks should be (1) user-centric,
reflecting realistic information needs, (2) dynamic, requiring up-to-date
information beyond parametric knowledge, (3) unambiguous, ensuring consistent
interpretation across users, and (4) multi-faceted and search-intensive,
requiring search over numerous web sources and in-depth analysis. Existing
benchmarks fall short of these principles, often focusing on narrow domains or
posing ambiguous questions that hinder fair comparison. Guided by these
principles, we introduce LiveResearchBench, a benchmark of 100 expert-curated
tasks spanning daily life, enterprise, and academia, each requiring extensive,
dynamic, real-time web search and synthesis. Built with over 1,500 hours of
human labor, LiveResearchBench provides a rigorous basis for systematic
evaluation. To evaluate citation-grounded long-form reports, we introduce
DeepEval, a comprehensive suite covering both content- and report-level
quality, including coverage, presentation, citation accuracy and association,
consistency and depth of analysis. DeepEval integrates four complementary
evaluation protocols, each designed to ensure stable assessment and high
agreement with human judgments. Using LiveResearchBench and DeepEval, we
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17 frontier deep research systems,
including single-agent web search, single-agent deep research, and multi-agent
systems. Our analysis reveals current strengths, recurring failure modes, and
key system components needed to advance reliable, insightful deep research.

*Wangtao Sun,Xiang Cheng,Jialin Fan,Yao Xu,Xing Yu,Shizhu He,Jun Zhao,Kang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agentic Self-Learning (ASL) is a fully closed-loop reinforcement learning framework that enables LLM-based agents to self-improve without human data or rule-based rewards, using multi-role co-evolution of task generation, policy execution, and reward evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To scale LLM-based agents without relying on human-curated datasets or predefined rule-based rewards, addressing the limitations of current approaches that plateau or degrade in performance.

Method: Proposed Agentic Self-Learning (ASL) framework with three coordinated components: Prompt Generator, Policy Model, and Generative Reward Model (GRM) that co-evolve in a virtuous cycle. Uses multi-role reinforcement learning in a shared tool environment.

Result: ASL delivers steady performance gains, surpasses RLVR baselines like Search-R1, continues improving under zero-labeled-data conditions, and shows superior sample efficiency. GRM verification capacity is identified as the main bottleneck.

Conclusion: Reward source (GRM vs rule-based) and data scale are critical for open-domain agent learning. Multi-role co-evolution enables scalable, self-improving agents, with continual GRM training being essential to avoid reward hacking and raise performance ceilings.

Abstract: We study whether self-learning can scale LLM-based agents without relying on
human-curated datasets or predefined rule-based rewards. Through controlled
experiments in a search-agent setting, we identify two key determinants of
scalable agent training: the source of reward signals and the scale of agent
task data. We find that rewards from a Generative Reward Model (GRM) outperform
rigid rule-based signals for open-domain learning, and that co-evolving the GRM
with the policy further boosts performance. Increasing the volume of agent task
data-even when synthetically generated-substantially enhances agentic
capabilities. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{Agentic
Self-Learning} (ASL), a fully closed-loop, multi-role reinforcement learning
framework that unifies task generation, policy execution, and evaluation within
a shared tool environment and LLM backbone. ASL coordinates a Prompt Generator,
a Policy Model, and a Generative Reward Model to form a virtuous cycle of
harder task setting, sharper verification, and stronger solving. Empirically,
ASL delivers steady, round-over-round gains, surpasses strong RLVR baselines
(e.g., Search-R1) that plateau or degrade, and continues improving under
zero-labeled-data conditions, indicating superior sample efficiency and
robustness. We further show that GRM verification capacity is the main
bottleneck: if frozen, it induces reward hacking and stalls progress; continual
GRM training on the evolving data distribution mitigates this, and a small
late-stage injection of real verification data raises the performance ceiling.
This work establishes reward source and data scale as critical levers for
open-domain agent learning and demonstrates the efficacy of multi-role
co-evolution for scalable, self-improving agents. The data and code of this
paper are released at

TL;DR: MorphoBench is a dynamic benchmark that evaluates large models' reasoning capabilities using multidisciplinary questions and adaptively adjusts difficulty based on model performance, featuring over 1,300 test questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for evaluating reasoning capabilities of large models are limited in scope and lack flexibility to adapt difficulty as models evolve, creating a need for more comprehensive and adaptive evaluation tools.

Method: Curates questions from existing benchmarks and Olympiad competitions, adaptively modifies question difficulty using key statements from model reasoning processes, and generates questions via simulation software for dynamic difficulty adjustment with minimal resources.

Result: Developed MorphoBench with over 1,300 test questions, iteratively adjusted difficulty based on models like o3 and GPT-5, enhancing evaluation comprehensiveness and validity.

Conclusion: MorphoBench provides reliable guidance for improving reasoning abilities and scientific robustness of large models through its adaptive, comprehensive evaluation framework.

Abstract: With the advancement of powerful large-scale reasoning models, effectively
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of these models has become increasingly
important. However, existing benchmarks designed to assess the reasoning
abilities of large models tend to be limited in scope and lack the flexibility
to adapt their difficulty according to the evolving reasoning capacities of the
models. To address this, we propose MorphoBench, a benchmark that incorporates
multidisciplinary questions to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of large
models and can adjust and update question difficulty based on the reasoning
abilities of advanced models. Specifically, we curate the benchmark by
selecting and collecting complex reasoning questions from existing benchmarks
and sources such as Olympiad-level competitions. Additionally, MorphoBench
adaptively modifies the analytical challenge of questions by leveraging key
statements generated during the model's reasoning process. Furthermore, it
includes questions generated using simulation software, enabling dynamic
adjustment of benchmark difficulty with minimal resource consumption. We have
gathered over 1,300 test questions and iteratively adjusted the difficulty of
MorphoBench based on the reasoning capabilities of models such as o3 and GPT-5.
MorphoBench enhances the comprehensiveness and validity of model reasoning
evaluation, providing reliable guidance for improving both the reasoning
abilities and scientific robustness of large models. The code has been released
in https://github.com/OpenDCAI/MorphoBench.

*Bingjie Zhang,Yibo Yang,Renzhe,Dandan Guo,Jindong Gu,Philip Torr,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GuardSpace is a framework that preserves safety alignment in LLMs during fine-tuning by decomposing weights into safety-relevant and irrelevant components, and restricting updates to maintain refusal behavior on harmful prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' safety alignment is fragile during fine-tuning, where even benign data adaptation can degrade pre-trained safety behaviors and lead to harmful responses.

Method: Decompose pre-trained weights using covariance-preconditioned SVD into safety-relevant (frozen) and irrelevant components, and use null space projection to restrict adapter updates from altering safe outputs on harmful prompts.

Result: GuardSpace reduces harmful score from 14.4% to 3.6% and improves accuracy from 26.0% to 28.0% for Llama-2-7B-Chat on GSM8K, outperforming state-of-the-art method AsFT.

Conclusion: GuardSpace effectively preserves safety alignment throughout fine-tuning while maintaining or improving task performance across various models and downstream tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in diverse
tasks, yet their safety alignment remains fragile during adaptation. Even when
fine-tuning on benign data or with low-rank adaptation, pre-trained safety
behaviors are easily degraded, leading to harmful responses in the fine-tuned
models. To address this challenge, we propose GuardSpace, a guardrail framework
for preserving safety alignment throughout fine-tuning, composed of two key
components: a safety-sensitive subspace and a harmful-resistant null space.
First, we explicitly decompose pre-trained weights into safety-relevant and
safety-irrelevant components using covariance-preconditioned singular value
decomposition, and initialize low-rank adapters from the safety-irrelevant
ones, while freezing safety-relevant components to preserve their associated
safety mechanism. Second, we construct a null space projector that restricts
adapter updates from altering safe outputs on harmful prompts, thereby
maintaining the original refusal behavior. Experiments with various pre-trained
models on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that GuardSpace achieves
superior performance over existing methods. Notably, for Llama-2-7B-Chat
fine-tuned on GSM8K, GuardSpace outperforms the state-of-the-art method AsFT,
reducing the average harmful score from 14.4% to 3.6%, while improving the
accuracy from from 26.0% to 28.0%.

TL;DR: Terrarium is a framework for studying safety, privacy, and security in LLM-based multi-agent systems, using a modular testbed to identify and analyze various attack vectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-powered multi-agent systems can automate complex tasks but introduce new risks including misalignment, malicious attacks, and data theft that need systematic study.

Method: Repurposes the blackboard design pattern to create a modular, configurable testbed for multi-agent collaboration, implementing three collaborative scenarios with four representative attacks.

Result: Developed a flexible framework that enables rapid prototyping, evaluation, and iteration on defenses against identified attack vectors like misalignment, malicious agents, compromised communication, and data poisoning.

Conclusion: Terrarium accelerates progress toward trustworthy multi-agent systems by providing tools to systematically study and address security, privacy, and safety concerns in LLM-based MAS.

Abstract: A multi-agent system (MAS) powered by large language models (LLMs) can
automate tedious user tasks such as meeting scheduling that requires
inter-agent collaboration. LLMs enable nuanced protocols that account for
unstructured private data, user constraints, and preferences. However, this
design introduces new risks, including misalignment and attacks by malicious
parties that compromise agents or steal user data. In this paper, we propose
the Terrarium framework for fine-grained study on safety, privacy, and security
in LLM-based MAS. We repurpose the blackboard design, an early approach in
multi-agent systems, to create a modular, configurable testbed for multi-agent
collaboration. We identify key attack vectors such as misalignment, malicious
agents, compromised communication, and data poisoning. We implement three
collaborative MAS scenarios with four representative attacks to demonstrate the
framework's flexibility. By providing tools to rapidly prototype, evaluate, and
iterate on defenses and designs, Terrarium aims to accelerate progress toward
trustworthy multi-agent systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MASC is a metacognitive framework that enables multi-agent systems to detect and correct step-level errors in real-time to prevent error propagation across agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent systems using LLMs are vulnerable to cascading errors where a single faulty step can disrupt the entire problem-solving trajectory, highlighting the need for real-time error detection and correction.

Method: Uses two complementary designs: Next-Execution Reconstruction (predicts next step embeddings to capture causal consistency) and Prototype-Guided Enhancement (learns normal-step embeddings to stabilize anomaly scoring under sparse context). When anomalies are detected, a correction agent revises outputs before downstream propagation.

Result: On Who&When benchmark, improved step-level error detection by up to 8.47% AUC-ROC. When integrated into various MAS frameworks, delivered consistent end-to-end performance gains across different architectures.

Conclusion: MASC's metacognitive monitoring and targeted correction effectively mitigate error propagation in multi-agent systems with minimal overhead, demonstrating robust performance across diverse architectures.

Abstract: Large Language Model based multi-agent systems (MAS) excel at collaborative
problem solving but remain brittle to cascading errors: a single faulty step
can propagate across agents and disrupt the trajectory. In this paper, we
present MASC, a metacognitive framework that endows MAS with real-time,
unsupervised, step-level error detection and self-correction. MASC rethinks
detection as history-conditioned anomaly scoring via two complementary designs:
(1) Next-Execution Reconstruction, which predicts the embedding of the next
step from the query and interaction history to capture causal consistency, and
(2) Prototype-Guided Enhancement, which learns a prototype prior over
normal-step embeddings and uses it to stabilize reconstruction and anomaly
scoring under sparse context (e.g., early steps). When an anomaly step is
flagged, MASC triggers a correction agent to revise the acting agent's output
before information flows downstream. On the Who&When benchmark, MASC
consistently outperforms all baselines, improving step-level error detection by
up to 8.47% AUC-ROC ; When plugged into diverse MAS frameworks, it delivers
consistent end-to-end gains across architectures, confirming that our
metacognitive monitoring and targeted correction can mitigate error propagation
with minimal overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI services are reactive and only respond to explicit commands, while users need intelligent assistants that can anticipate needs and act proactively.

Method: Alpha-Service framework with five components inspired by von Neumann architecture: Input Unit (perception), Central Processing Unit (task scheduling), Arithmetic Logic Unit (tool use), Memory Unit (personalization), and Output Unit (human interaction), implemented as multi-agent system on AI glasses.

Result: Case studies including Blackjack advisor, museum guide, and shopping assistant demonstrate successful environment perception, intent inference, and timely assistance without user prompts.

Conclusion: Alpha-Service enables proactive AI assistance that can seamlessly integrate into daily life by anticipating user needs and providing real-time help through AI glasses.

Abstract: In an era where AI is evolving from a passive tool into an active and
adaptive companion, we introduce AI for Service (AI4Service), a new paradigm
that enables proactive and real-time assistance in daily life. Existing AI
services remain largely reactive, responding only to explicit user commands. We
argue that a truly intelligent and helpful assistant should be capable of
anticipating user needs and taking actions proactively when appropriate. To
realize this vision, we propose Alpha-Service, a unified framework that
addresses two fundamental challenges: Know When to intervene by detecting
service opportunities from egocentric video streams, and Know How to provide
both generalized and personalized services. Inspired by the von Neumann
computer architecture and based on AI glasses, Alpha-Service consists of five
key components: an Input Unit for perception, a Central Processing Unit for
task scheduling, an Arithmetic Logic Unit for tool utilization, a Memory Unit
for long-term personalization, and an Output Unit for natural human
interaction. As an initial exploration, we implement Alpha-Service through a
multi-agent system deployed on AI glasses. Case studies, including a real-time
Blackjack advisor, a museum tour guide, and a shopping fit assistant,
demonstrate its ability to seamlessly perceive the environment, infer user
intent, and provide timely and useful assistance without explicit prompts.

TL;DR: IP-Merging is a tuning-free method that enables multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) to directly absorb math reasoning abilities from math LLMs by identifying reasoning-associated parameters, projecting them into MLLM's subspace, and merging while maintaining alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lag behind LLMs in math reasoning despite significant LLM advancements. The authors want to enable MLLMs to directly acquire math reasoning capabilities from existing math LLMs without additional training.

Method: IP-Merging identifies reasoning-associated parameters in both MLLM and math LLM, projects them into MLLM's subspace to maintain alignment, and merges parameters in this subspace without tuning.

Result: Extensive experiments show IP-Merging successfully enhances MLLMs' math reasoning abilities from math LLMs without compromising other capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed IP-Merging method provides an effective tuning-free approach for transferring math reasoning abilities from specialized math LLMs to MLLMs while preserving their multimodal capabilities.

Abstract: Math reasoning has been one crucial ability of large language models (LLMs),
where significant advancements have been achieved in recent years. However,
most efforts focus on LLMs by curating high-quality annotation data and
intricate training (or inference) paradigms, while the math reasoning
performance of multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) remains lagging behind. Since the MLLM
typically consists of an LLM and a vision block, we wonder: Can MLLMs directly
absorb math reasoning abilities from off-the-shelf math LLMs without tuning?
Recent model-merging approaches may offer insights into this question. However,
they overlook the alignment between the MLLM and LLM, where we find that there
is a large gap between their parameter spaces, resulting in lower performance.
Our empirical evidence reveals two key factors behind this issue: the
identification of crucial reasoning-associated layers in the model and the
mitigation of the gaps in parameter space. Based on the empirical insights, we
propose IP-Merging that first identifies the reasoning-associated parameters in
both MLLM and Math LLM, then projects them into the subspace of MLLM, aiming to
maintain the alignment, and finally merges parameters in this subspace.
IP-Merging is a tuning-free approach since parameters are directly adjusted.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our IP-Merging method can enhance the
math reasoning ability of MLLMs directly from Math LLMs without compromising
their other capabilities.

*Zhe Wu,Hongjin Lu,Junliang Xing,Changhao Zhang,Yin Zhu,Yuhao Yang,Yuheng Jing,Kai Li,Kun Shao,Jianye Hao,Jun Wang,Yuanchun Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hi-Agent is a hierarchical vision-language agent for mobile control that achieves SOTA 87.9% task success on Android-in-the-Wild benchmark, significantly outperforming prior methods through joint optimization of high-level reasoning and low-level action models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for mobile device agents rely on direct state-to-action mappings, which lack structured reasoning and planning, leading to poor generalization to novel tasks or unseen UI layouts.

Method: Hi-Agent uses a hierarchical architecture with high-level reasoning and low-level action models jointly optimized. It reformulates multi-step decision-making as single-step subgoals and introduces a foresight advantage function that leverages execution feedback to guide high-level optimization, addressing path explosion issues in long-horizon tasks.

Result: Achieves 87.9% task success rate on Android-in-the-Wild benchmark, significantly outperforming prompt-based (17.7%), supervised (54.5%), and RL-based (71.9%) methods. Also shows competitive zero-shot generalization on ScreenSpot-v2 and scales effectively on AndroidWorld benchmark.

Conclusion: Hi-Agent's hierarchical design with joint optimization enables stable, critic-free training and demonstrates strong performance and generalization in mobile control tasks, establishing a new SOTA in the field.

Abstract: Building agents that autonomously operate mobile devices has attracted
increasing attention. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise, most
existing approaches rely on direct state-to-action mappings, which lack
structured reasoning and planning, and thus generalize poorly to novel tasks or
unseen UI layouts. We introduce Hi-Agent, a trainable hierarchical
vision-language agent for mobile control, featuring a high-level reasoning
model and a low-level action model that are jointly optimized. For efficient
training, we reformulate multi-step decision-making as a sequence of
single-step subgoals and propose a foresight advantage function, which
leverages execution feedback from the low-level model to guide high-level
optimization. This design alleviates the path explosion issue encountered by
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in long-horizon tasks and enables
stable, critic-free joint training. Hi-Agent achieves a new State-Of-The-Art
(SOTA) 87.9% task success rate on the Android-in-the-Wild (AitW) benchmark,
significantly outperforming prior methods across three paradigms: prompt-based
(AppAgent: 17.7%), supervised (Filtered BC: 54.5%), and reinforcement
learning-based (DigiRL: 71.9%). It also demonstrates competitive zero-shot
generalization on the ScreenSpot-v2 benchmark. On the more challenging
AndroidWorld benchmark, Hi-Agent also scales effectively with larger backbones,
showing strong adaptability in high-complexity mobile control scenarios.

*Xikai Zhang,Bo Wang,Likang Xiao,Yongzhi Li,Quan Chen,Wenju Wu,Liu Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The IMAGINE framework integrates Multi-Agent System reasoning capabilities into a single compact model, achieving superior performance on complex planning tasks while reducing model size and reasoning costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with complex reasoning and planning tasks, achieving low success rates even with advanced prompting. Multi-Agent Systems offer better collective reasoning but suffer from high computational costs, latency issues, and training difficulties.

Method: Proposed IMAGINE framework that integrates Multi-Agent System reasoning and planning capabilities into a single compact model through end-to-end training, enabling a small model to acquire structured reasoning abilities.

Result: When trained on Qwen3-8B-Instruct, IMAGINE achieved 82.7% Final Pass Rate on TravelPlanner benchmark, significantly outperforming DeepSeek-R1-671B's 40% while using a much smaller model size.

Conclusion: The IMAGINE framework successfully demonstrates that a single compact model can surpass the capabilities of complex Multi-Agent Systems in reasoning and planning tasks, offering a scalable and efficient solution to complex reasoning challenges.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides across
various tasks, they still face significant challenges in complex reasoning and
planning. For example, even with carefully designed prompts and prior
information explicitly provided, GPT-4o achieves only a 7% Final Pass Rate on
the TravelPlanner dataset in the sole-planning mode. Similarly, even in the
thinking mode, Qwen3-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-671B, only achieve Final Pass
Rates of 5.9% and 40%, respectively. Although well-organized Multi-Agent
Systems (MAS) can offer improved collective reasoning, they often suffer from
high reasoning costs due to multi-round internal interactions, long
per-response latency, and difficulties in end-to-end training. To address these
challenges, we propose a general and scalable framework called IMAGINE, short
for Integrating Multi-Agent System into One Model. This framework not only
integrates the reasoning and planning capabilities of MAS into a single,
compact model, but also significantly surpass the capabilities of the MAS
through a simple end-to-end training. Through this pipeline, a single
small-scale model is not only able to acquire the structured reasoning and
planning capabilities of a well-organized MAS but can also significantly
outperform it. Experimental results demonstrate that, when using
Qwen3-8B-Instruct as the base model and training it with our method, the model
achieves an 82.7% Final Pass Rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, far exceeding
the 40% of DeepSeek-R1-671B, while maintaining a much smaller model size.

### [126] [Eliminating Negative Occurrences of Derived Predicates from PDDL Axioms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14412)
*Claudia Grundke,Gabriele Röger*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a transformation method to eliminate negative occurrences of derived predicates in PDDL axioms, showing that both PDDL's restricted approach and the more permissive stratifiable approach can express the same queries as least fixed-point logic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the discrepancy between the PDDL standard's strict limitations on negative predicate occurrences in axioms and the more flexible stratifiable approach commonly used in literature, aiming to show their equivalence.

Method: Developed a transformation technique that converts axioms with negative occurrences of derived predicates into an equivalent form that complies with PDDL's restrictions, demonstrating that negative occurrences can be eliminated.

Result: Successfully proved that both approaches (PDDL's restricted version and the stratifiable version) can express exactly the same queries as least fixed-point logic, establishing their formal equivalence.

Conclusion: Negative occurrences of derived predicates in PDDL axioms can be eliminated through transformation, validating that the more permissive stratifiable approach doesn't provide additional expressive power beyond the standard PDDL restrictions.

Abstract: Axioms are a feature of the Planning Domain Definition Language PDDL that can
be considered as a generalization of database query languages such as Datalog.
The PDDL standard restricts negative occurrences of predicates in axiom bodies
to predicates that are directly set by actions and not derived by axioms. In
the literature, authors often deviate from this limitation and only require
that the set of axioms is stratifiable. Both variants can express exactly the
same queries as least fixed-point logic, indicating that negative occurrences
of derived predicates can be eliminated. We present the corresponding
transformation.

### [127] [Helmsman: Autonomous Synthesis of Federated Learning Systems via Multi-Agent Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14512)
*Haoyuan Li,Mathias Funk,Aaqib Saeed*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Helmsman is a multi-agent system that automates federated learning system design from user specs, using human-in-the-loop planning, modular code generation, and autonomous evaluation to create robust FL solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning faces complexity in designing robust systems due to data heterogeneity and system constraints, leading to brittle bespoke solutions that need automation.

Method: Three-phase approach: (1) interactive human-in-the-loop planning, (2) modular code generation by supervised agent teams, (3) autonomous evaluation and refinement in sandboxed simulation. Also introduces AgentFL-Bench benchmark.

Result: Generated solutions are competitive with and often superior to established hand-crafted baselines across 16 diverse tasks in the AgentFL-Bench benchmark.

Conclusion: Significant step towards automated engineering of complex decentralized AI systems, demonstrating effective automation of FL system design.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a powerful paradigm for training models on
decentralized data, but its promise is often undermined by the immense
complexity of designing and deploying robust systems. The need to select,
combine, and tune strategies for multifaceted challenges like data
heterogeneity and system constraints has become a critical bottleneck,
resulting in brittle, bespoke solutions. To address this, we introduce
Helmsman, a novel multi-agent system that automates the end-to-end synthesis of
federated learning systems from high-level user specifications. It emulates a
principled research and development workflow through three collaborative
phases: (1) interactive human-in-the-loop planning to formulate a sound
research plan, (2) modular code generation by supervised agent teams, and (3) a
closed-loop of autonomous evaluation and refinement in a sandboxed simulation
environment. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we also introduce
AgentFL-Bench, a new benchmark comprising 16 diverse tasks designed to assess
the system-level generation capabilities of agentic systems in FL. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach generates solutions competitive with,
and often superior to, established hand-crafted baselines. Our work represents
a significant step towards the automated engineering of complex decentralized
AI systems.

### [128] [JSPLIT: A Taxonomy-based Solution for Prompt Bloating in Model Context Protocol](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14537)
*Emanuele Antonioni,Stefan Markovic,Anirudha Shankar,Jaime Bernardo,Lovro Markovic,Silvia Pareti,Benedetto Proietti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JSPLIT is a taxonomy-driven framework that reduces prompt bloating in AI agents by organizing tools hierarchically and selecting only relevant tools based on user queries, improving efficiency and task success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI systems evolve, users demand more complex interactions requiring LLMs to use external tools. Current approaches using standards like MCP cause prompt bloating - longer prompts lead to higher costs, increased latency, and reduced task success due to irrelevant tool inclusion.

Method: JSPLIT organizes MCP tools into a hierarchical taxonomy and uses the user's prompt to identify and include only the most relevant tools based on both query content and taxonomy structure, implementing a tool selection algorithm.

Result: JSPLIT significantly reduces prompt size without compromising agent effectiveness. As tool numbers grow substantially, it even improves tool selection accuracy, effectively reducing costs while improving task success in high-complexity environments.

Conclusion: JSPLIT successfully addresses prompt bloating in agentic systems by using taxonomy-driven tool selection, enabling more efficient and effective AI interactions with external tools while reducing computational costs.

Abstract: AI systems are continually evolving and advancing, and user expectations are
concurrently increasing, with a growing demand for interactions that go beyond
simple text-based interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs). Today's
applications often require LLMs to interact with external tools, marking a
shift toward more complex agentic systems. To support this, standards such as
the Model Context Protocol (MCP) have emerged, enabling agents to access tools
by including a specification of the capabilities of each tool within the
prompt. Although this approach expands what agents can do, it also introduces a
growing problem: prompt bloating. As the number of tools increases, the prompts
become longer, leading to high prompt token costs, increased latency, and
reduced task success resulting from the selection of tools irrelevant to the
prompt. To address this issue, we introduce JSPLIT, a taxonomy-driven framework
designed to help agents manage prompt size more effectively when using large
sets of MCP tools. JSPLIT organizes the tools into a hierarchical taxonomy and
uses the user's prompt to identify and include only the most relevant tools,
based on both the query and the taxonomy structure. In this paper, we describe
the design of the taxonomy, the tool selection algorithm, and the dataset used
to evaluate JSPLIT. Our results show that JSPLIT significantly reduces prompt
size without significantly compromising the agent's ability to respond
effectively. As the number of available tools for the agent grows
substantially, JSPLIT even improves the tool selection accuracy of the agent,
effectively reducing costs while simultaneously improving task success in
high-complexity agent environments.

### [129] [Symbol Grounding in Neuro-Symbolic AI: A Gentle Introduction to Reasoning Shortcuts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14538)
*Emanuele Marconato,Samuele Bortolotti,Emile van Krieken,Paolo Morettin,Elena Umili,Antonio Vergari,Efthymia Tsamoura,Andrea Passerini,Stefano Teso*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper provides an overview of Reasoning Shortcuts (RSs) in neuro-symbolic AI - a phenomenon where models achieve high accuracy by incorrectly grounding concepts, compromising interpretability and reliability. It offers a unified perspective on RS causes, consequences, and mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neuro-symbolic AI aims to create reliable and trustworthy AI by combining neural networks with symbolic reasoning, but Reasoning Shortcuts undermine this goal by allowing models to achieve high performance while grounding concepts incorrectly, which is difficult to detect without direct concept supervision.

Method: The paper provides a comprehensive overview and gentle introduction to Reasoning Shortcuts, discusses their causes and consequences, reviews existing theoretical characterizations, and details methods for dealing with RSs including mitigation and awareness strategies.

Result: The overview reformulates advanced material into digestible form, providing a unifying perspective on Reasoning Shortcuts that lowers the barrier to entry for researchers and practitioners to understand and tackle this challenging problem in neuro-symbolic AI.

Conclusion: This overview aims to contribute to the development of reliable neuro-symbolic and trustworthy AI models by providing a comprehensive understanding of Reasoning Shortcuts and strategies to address them, ultimately supporting the creation of more interpretable and robust AI systems.

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic (NeSy) AI aims to develop deep neural networks whose
predictions comply with prior knowledge encoding, e.g. safety or structural
constraints. As such, it represents one of the most promising avenues for
reliable and trustworthy AI. The core idea behind NeSy AI is to combine neural
and symbolic steps: neural networks are typically responsible for mapping
low-level inputs into high-level symbolic concepts, while symbolic reasoning
infers predictions compatible with the extracted concepts and the prior
knowledge. Despite their promise, it was recently shown that - whenever the
concepts are not supervised directly - NeSy models can be affected by Reasoning
Shortcuts (RSs). That is, they can achieve high label accuracy by grounding the
concepts incorrectly. RSs can compromise the interpretability of the model's
explanations, performance in out-of-distribution scenarios, and therefore
reliability. At the same time, RSs are difficult to detect and prevent unless
concept supervision is available, which is typically not the case. However, the
literature on RSs is scattered, making it difficult for researchers and
practitioners to understand and tackle this challenging problem. This overview
addresses this issue by providing a gentle introduction to RSs, discussing
their causes and consequences in intuitive terms. It also reviews and
elucidates existing theoretical characterizations of this phenomenon. Finally,
it details methods for dealing with RSs, including mitigation and awareness
strategies, and maps their benefits and limitations. By reformulating advanced
material in a digestible form, this overview aims to provide a unifying
perspective on RSs to lower the bar to entry for tackling them. Ultimately, we
hope this overview contributes to the development of reliable NeSy and
trustworthy AI models.

*Asen Nachkov,Xi Wang,Luc Van Gool*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores whether LLM agents can evolve from problem-solving tools into autonomous entities capable of planning, task generation, and reasoning toward ambiguous goals through open-ended experimentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if LLM agents can represent autonomous entities that plan, design tasks, and reason toward broader goals, moving beyond their current role as smart problem-solving tools.

Method: Augment a pretrained LLM agent with capabilities to generate its own tasks, accumulate knowledge, and interact extensively with its environment in an open-ended experimental setting.

Result: The agent can reliably follow complex multi-step instructions, store and reuse information across runs, and propose and solve its own tasks, but remains sensitive to prompt design, prone to repetitive task generation, and unable to form self-representations.

Conclusion: The findings show both promise and current limitations in adapting pretrained LLMs for open-endedness, pointing to future directions for training agents to manage memory, explore productively, and pursue abstract long-term goals.

Abstract: Recent LLM agents have made great use of chain of thought reasoning and
function calling. As their capabilities grow, an important question arises: can
this software represent not only a smart problem-solving tool, but an entity in
its own right, that can plan, design immediate tasks, and reason toward
broader, more ambiguous goals? To study this question, we adopt an open-ended
experimental setting where we augment a pretrained LLM agent with the ability
to generate its own tasks, accumulate knowledge, and interact extensively with
its environment. We study the resulting open-ended agent qualitatively. It can
reliably follow complex multi-step instructions, store and reuse information
across runs, and propose and solve its own tasks, though it remains sensitive
to prompt design, prone to repetitive task generation, and unable to form
self-representations. These findings illustrate both the promise and current
limits of adapting pretrained LLMs toward open-endedness, and point to future
directions for training agents to manage memory, explore productively, and
pursue abstract long-term goals.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces ColorBench, a graph-structured benchmarking framework for evaluating multimodal mobile agents on complex long-horizon tasks, addressing limitations of current evaluation methods by supporting multiple valid solutions and quasi-dynamic interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mobile agent evaluation methods are inadequate - offline static benchmarks only validate single predefined paths, while online dynamic testing faces complexity and non-reproducibility issues. There's a need for comprehensive assessment that bridges offline and online evaluation.

Method: Developed a graph-structured benchmarking framework that models finite states from real-device interactions to achieve static simulation of dynamic behaviors. Created ColorBench with 175 tasks (74 single-app, 101 cross-app) averaging over 13 steps, each containing multiple correct paths and typical error paths.

Result: ColorBench enables evaluation of multiple valid solutions, subtask completion rate statistics, and atomic-level capability analysis. Evaluation across various baselines revealed limitations of existing models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework bridges the gap between offline and online evaluation, enhances testing stability, and provides improvement directions and technical pathways for enhancing agent performance on complex long-horizon problems.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models has enabled agents
to operate mobile devices by directly interacting with graphical user
interfaces, opening new possibilities for mobile automation. However,
real-world mobile tasks are often complex and allow for multiple valid
solutions. This contradicts current mobile agent evaluation standards: offline
static benchmarks can only validate a single predefined "golden path", while
online dynamic testing is constrained by the complexity and non-reproducibility
of real devices, making both approaches inadequate for comprehensively
assessing agent capabilities. To bridge the gap between offline and online
evaluation and enhance testing stability, this paper introduces a novel
graph-structured benchmarking framework. By modeling the finite states observed
during real-device interactions, it achieves static simulation of dynamic
behaviors. Building on this, we develop ColorBench, a benchmark focused on
complex long-horizon tasks. It supports evaluation of multiple valid solutions,
subtask completion rate statistics, and atomic-level capability analysis.
ColorBench contains 175 tasks (74 single-app, 101 cross-app) with an average
length of over 13 steps. Each task includes at least two correct paths and
several typical error paths, enabling quasi-dynamic interaction. By evaluating
ColorBench across various baselines, we discover limitations of existing models
and propose improvement directions and feasible technical pathways to enhance
agents' performance on complex, long-horizon problems based on experimental
results. Code and data are available at:

*Rikard Rosenbacke,Carl Rosenbacke,Victor Rosenbacke,Martin McKee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Rose-Frame, a three-dimensional framework for diagnosing cognitive and epistemic drift in human-AI interaction, addressing LLMs' tendency to produce convincing but potentially unfounded outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs inherit ambiguity, bias, and lack direct access to truth from language itself, creating risks of hallucination where outputs sound convincing but lack factual validity. They operationalize System 1 cognition (fast, associative thinking) without reflection or falsification.

Method: Rose-Frame framework with three axes: (1) Map vs. Territory - distinguishing representations of reality from reality itself; (2) Intuition vs. Reason - separating fast emotional judgments from slow reflective thinking; (3) Conflict vs. Confirmation - examining whether ideas are critically tested or simply reinforced.

Result: The framework provides a diagnostic tool for cognitive and epistemic drift in human-AI interaction, making both model limitations and user assumptions visible without attempting technical fixes to LLMs.

Conclusion: Alignment should be reframed as cognitive governance where intuition (human or artificial) must remain governed by human reason. Only through reflective, falsifiable oversight can machine fluency be aligned with human understanding.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming deeply embedded in human
communication and decision-making, yet they inherit the ambiguity, bias, and
lack of direct access to truth inherent in language itself. While their outputs
are fluent, emotionally resonant, and coherent, they are generated through
statistical prediction rather than grounded reasoning. This creates the risk of
hallucination, responses that sound convincing but lack factual validity.
Building on Geoffrey Hinton's observation that AI mirrors human intuition
rather than reasoning, this paper argues that LLMs operationalize System 1
cognition at scale: fast, associative, and persuasive, but without reflection
or falsification. To address this, we introduce the Rose-Frame, a
three-dimensional framework for diagnosing cognitive and epistemic drift in
human-AI interaction. The three axes are: (i) Map vs. Territory, which
distinguishes representations of reality (epistemology) from reality itself
(ontology); (ii) Intuition vs. Reason, drawing on dual-process theory to
separate fast, emotional judgments from slow, reflective thinking; and (iii)
Conflict vs. Confirmation, which examines whether ideas are critically tested
through disagreement or simply reinforced through mutual validation. Each
dimension captures a distinct failure mode, and their combination amplifies
misalignment. Rose-Frame does not attempt to fix LLMs with more data or rules.
Instead, it offers a reflective tool that makes both the model's limitations
and the user's assumptions visible, enabling more transparent and critically
aware AI deployment. It reframes alignment as cognitive governance: intuition,
whether human or artificial, must remain governed by human reason. Only by
embedding reflective, falsifiable oversight can we align machine fluency with
human understanding.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a systematic review of algorithmic bias in Dutch public health ML research (2021-2025) using a new assessment tool (RABAT), revealing significant gaps in fairness considerations, and proposes a four-stage framework (ACAR) to address these issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning in public health risks reinforcing existing health disparities if algorithmic bias is not systematically addressed, requiring better identification, discussion, and reporting of bias issues.

Method: Developed the Risk of Algorithmic Bias Assessment Tool (RABAT) by integrating established frameworks, applied it to 35 peer-reviewed studies through systematic literature review, and created the ACAR framework (Awareness, Conceptualization, Application, Reporting) with guiding questions.

Result: Analysis revealed pervasive gaps: most studies omit explicit fairness framing, subgroup analyses, and transparent discussion of potential harms, despite good documentation of data sampling and missing data practices.

Conclusion: Provides actionable recommendations for public health ML practitioners to consistently consider algorithmic bias and foster transparency, ensuring algorithmic innovations advance health equity rather than undermine it.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) promises to revolutionize public health through
improved surveillance, risk stratification, and resource allocation. However,
without systematic attention to algorithmic bias, ML may inadvertently
reinforce existing health disparities. We present a systematic literature
review of algorithmic bias identification, discussion, and reporting in Dutch
public health ML research from 2021 to 2025. To this end, we developed the Risk
of Algorithmic Bias Assessment Tool (RABAT) by integrating elements from
established frameworks (Cochrane Risk of Bias, PROBAST, Microsoft Responsible
AI checklist) and applied it to 35 peer-reviewed studies. Our analysis reveals
pervasive gaps: although data sampling and missing data practices are well
documented, most studies omit explicit fairness framing, subgroup analyses, and
transparent discussion of potential harms. In response, we introduce a
four-stage fairness-oriented framework called ACAR (Awareness,
Conceptualization, Application, Reporting), with guiding questions derived from
our systematic literature review to help researchers address fairness across
the ML lifecycle. We conclude with actionable recommendations for public health
ML practitioners to consistently consider algorithmic bias and foster
transparency, ensuring that algorithmic innovations advance health equity
rather than undermine it.

Motivation: To enable natural-language cyber threat queries with executable reasoning over structured knowledge graphs, moving beyond traditional retrieval systems by allowing clear and reversible reasoning between threats, behaviors, and defenses.

Method: Integrates a path planner model that predicts logical relation chains from text, and a graph executor that traverses the TITAN Ontology (derived from MITRE) to retrieve factual answers and supporting evidence. Uses a typed, bidirectional graph structure.

Result: Empirical evaluations show TITAN enables models to generate syntactically valid and semantically coherent reasoning paths that can be deterministically executed on the underlying graph. Introduced the TITAN Dataset with 88,209 examples for training and evaluation.

Conclusion: TITAN successfully bridges natural language queries with executable reasoning over cyber threat knowledge graphs, providing a framework for automated threat intelligence analysis with deterministic execution capabilities.

Abstract: TITAN (Threat Intelligence Through Automated Navigation) is a framework that

TL;DR: A framework for learning abstract world models that jointly learns symbolic state representations and causal processes for both agent actions and exogenous mechanisms, enabling fast planning that generalizes to complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon embodied planning is challenging because the world changes not only through agent actions but also through exogenous processes (e.g., water heating, dominoes cascading) that unfold concurrently.

Method: Proposes a framework that jointly learns symbolic state representations and causal processes for both endogenous actions and exogenous mechanisms via variational Bayesian inference combined with LLM proposals.

Result: Across five simulated tabletop robotics environments, the learned models enable fast planning that generalizes to held-out tasks with more objects and more complex goals, outperforming a range of baselines.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the challenge of modeling concurrent endogenous and exogenous processes in embodied planning, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities in complex environments.

Abstract: Long-horizon embodied planning is challenging because the world does not only
change through an agent's actions: exogenous processes (e.g., water heating,
dominoes cascading) unfold concurrently with the agent's actions. We propose a
framework for abstract world models that jointly learns (i) symbolic state
representations and (ii) causal processes for both endogenous actions and
exogenous mechanisms. Each causal process models the time course of a
stochastic cause-effect relation. We learn these world models from limited data
via variational Bayesian inference combined with LLM proposals. Across five
simulated tabletop robotics environments, the learned models enable fast
planning that generalizes to held-out tasks with more objects and more complex
goals, outperforming a range of baselines.

### [136] [NAEL: Non-Anthropocentric Ethical Logic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14676)
*Bianca Maria Lerma,Rafael Peñaloza*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NAEL is a non-anthropocentric ethical framework for AI agents that combines active inference and symbolic reasoning to enable emergent ethical behavior in multi-agent environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of human-centered AI ethics by developing a framework that doesn't presuppose anthropomorphic moral intuitions and allows for context-sensitive, adaptive ethical behavior.

Method: Proposes a neuro-symbolic architecture integrating active inference (minimizing global expected free energy) with symbolic reasoning for ethical evaluation in uncertain multi-agent settings.

Result: The framework enables dynamic balancing of self-preservation, epistemic learning, and collective welfare, as demonstrated in a case study on ethical resource distribution.

Conclusion: NAEL provides a novel approach to AI ethics that supports emergent, relational ethical behavior without relying on human-centric moral assumptions.

Abstract: We introduce NAEL (Non-Anthropocentric Ethical Logic), a novel ethical
framework for artificial agents grounded in active inference and symbolic
reasoning. Departing from conventional, human-centred approaches to AI ethics,
NAEL formalizes ethical behaviour as an emergent property of intelligent
systems minimizing global expected free energy in dynamic, multi-agent
environments. We propose a neuro-symbolic architecture to allow agents to
evaluate the ethical consequences of their actions in uncertain settings. The
proposed system addresses the limitations of existing ethical models by
allowing agents to develop context-sensitive, adaptive, and relational ethical

### [137] [Practical, Utilitarian Algorithm Configuration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14683)
*Devon Graham,Kevin Leyton-Brown*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper improves the COUP utilitarian algorithm configuration procedure to make it competitive with heuristic methods while maintaining theoretical guarantees, and demonstrates utility function robustness analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between theoretically sound utilitarian algorithm configuration (COUP) and practical performance, making it competitive with heuristic methods that lack performance guarantees.

Method: A series of improvements to the COUP procedure that enhance empirical performance without compromising theoretical guarantees, plus experimental validation and utility function robustness analysis.

Result: The enhanced COUP achieves competitive performance with widely-used heuristic configuration procedures while maintaining strong theoretical guarantees about solution quality.

Conclusion: The improved COUP brings theoretically-grounded utilitarian algorithm configuration to practical competitiveness, enabling robust algorithm selection under varying user preferences.

Abstract: Utilitarian algorithm configuration identifies a parameter setting for a
given algorithm that maximizes a user's utility. Utility functions offer a
theoretically well-grounded approach to optimizing decision-making under
uncertainty and are flexible enough to capture a user's preferences over
algorithm runtimes (e.g., they can describe a sharp cutoff after which a
solution is no longer required, a per-hour cost for compute, or diminishing
returns from algorithms that take longer to run). COUP is a recently-introduced
utilitarian algorithm configuration procedure which was designed mainly to
offer strong theoretical guarantees about the quality of the configuration it
returns, with less attention paid to its practical performance. This paper
closes that gap, bringing theoretically-grounded, utilitarian algorithm
configuration to the point where it is competitive with widely used, heuristic
configuration procedures that offer no performance guarantees. We present a
series of improvements to COUP that improve its empirical performance without
degrading its theoretical guarantees and demonstrate their benefit
experimentally. Using a case study, we also illustrate ways of exploring the
robustness of a given solution to the algorithm selection problem to variations
in the utility function.

*Jinrui Liu,Bingyan Nie,Boyu Li,Yaran Chen,Yuze Wang,Shunsen He,Haoran Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RoboGPT-R1 is a two-stage fine-tuning framework that combines supervised training with reinforcement learning to improve embodied agents' reasoning capabilities for long-horizon manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large language and vision models struggle with long-horizon manipulation tasks in complex real-world environments due to limited common sense and reasoning capabilities. Supervised fine-tuning alone suffers from poor generalization and insufficient physical understanding.

Method: A two-stage framework: supervised training acquires foundational knowledge through expert sequences, followed by RL to address visual-spatial understanding and reasoning shortcomings. Uses a rule-based reward function that considers both long-horizon performance and action constraints.

Result: The model trained on Qwen2.5-VL-3B outperforms GPT-4o-mini by 21.33% and surpasses other work trained on Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 20.33% on the EmbodiedBench benchmark.

Conclusion: The proposed two-stage fine-tuning framework with RL effectively enhances embodied agents' reasoning capabilities for complex manipulation tasks, demonstrating superior performance despite using smaller models.

Abstract: Improving the reasoning capabilities of embodied agents is crucial for robots
to complete complex human instructions in long-view manipulation tasks
successfully. Despite the success of large language models and vision language
models based on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in planning tasks, they continue
facing challenges in performing long-horizon manipulation tasks in complex
real-world environments, owing to their restricted common sense and reasoning
capabilities. Considering that aligning general-purpose vision language models
to robotic planning tasks via supervised fine-tuning suffers from poor
generalization and insufficient physical understanding, we propose RoboGPT-R1,
a two-stage fine-tuning framework for embodied planning. In this framework,
supervised training acquires foundational knowledge through expert sequences,
followed by RL to address the model's shortcomings in visual-spatial
understanding and reasoning. To achieve physical understanding and action
sequence consistency in multi-step reasoning tasks, we design a rule-based
reward function that simultaneously considers long-horizon performance and
action constraint in the environment. The reasoning model, trained on
Qwen2.5-VL-3B, significantly outperforms the larger-scale model, GPT-4o-mini,
by 21.33% and surpasses other work trained on Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 20.33% on the
EmbodiedBench benchmark.

*Bang An,Yibo Yang,Philip Torr,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PAVE is a plug-and-play method that purifies task vectors by removing task-irrelevant redundancy in knowledge-aware subspace, improving model merging performance across various methods and architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model merging methods suffer from performance degradation due to task-irrelevant redundancy in task vectors, and current redundancy reduction approaches involve randomness and lack knowledge awareness.

Method: Proposes PAVE which uses context-oriented singular value decomposition on covariance matrices from task training examples to identify and prune redundant components in task vectors, with spectral rank allocation for fair pruning.

Result: PAVE effectively improves performance across diverse merging methods, tasks, and model architectures by reducing redundancy in task vectors.

Conclusion: PAVE provides an effective plug-and-play solution for purifying task vectors in model merging, addressing redundancy issues through knowledge-aware subspace analysis and improving overall merging performance.

Abstract: Model merging aims to integrate task-specific abilities from individually
fine-tuned models into a single model without extra training. In recent model
merging methods, task vector has become a fundamental building block, as it can
encapsulate the residual information from finetuning. However, the merged model
often suffers from notable performance degradation due to the conflicts caused
by task-irrelevant redundancy in task vectors. Existing efforts in overcoming
redundancy by randomly dropping elements in the parameter space involves
randomness and lacks knowledge awareness. To address these challenges, in this
study, we propose Purifying TAsk Vectors (PAVE) in knowledge-aware subspace.
Concretely, we sample some training examples from each task, and feed them into
their corresponding fine-tuned models to acquire the covariance matrices before
linear layers. We then perform a context-oriented singular value decomposition,
which accentuates the weight components most relevant to the target knowledge.
As a result, we can split fine-tuned model weights into task-relevant and
redundant components in the knowledge-aware subspace, and purify the task
vector by pruning the redundant components. To induce fair pruning efforts
across models, we further introduce a spectral rank allocation strategy by
optimizing a normalized activated pruning error. The task vector purification
by our method as a plug-and-play scheme is applicable across various task
vector-based merging methods to improve their performance. In experiments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of PAVE across a diverse set of merging methods,
tasks, and model architectures.

TL;DR: CoAST is a framework that enhances large language models for next POI recommendation by incorporating spatial-temporal knowledge and cognitive alignment with human preferences through continued pretraining and fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs lack understanding of structured geographical entities and sequential mobility patterns needed for POI prediction, and fail to incorporate world knowledge and human cognition factors like seasons, weather, holidays, and user profiles that could improve recommendation performance.

Method: CoAST uses natural language as interface and has 2 stages: (1) Recommendation Knowledge Acquisition through continued pretraining on enriched spatial-temporal trajectory data, (2) Cognitive Alignment using Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning to align with human preferences.

Result: Extensive offline experiments on real-world datasets and online deployment in AMAP App's "Guess Where You Go" feature demonstrate the framework's effectiveness.

Conclusion: CoAST successfully addresses LLMs' limitations in POI recommendation by incorporating spatial-temporal knowledge and cognitive alignment, showing improved performance in both offline and online settings.

Abstract: The next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation task aims to predict the
users' immediate next destinations based on their preferences and historical
check-ins, holding significant value in location-based services. Recently,
large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in recommender systems,
which treat the next POI prediction in a generative manner. However, these
LLMs, pretrained primarily on vast corpora of unstructured text, lack the
native understanding of structured geographical entities and sequential
mobility patterns required for next POI prediction tasks. Moreover, in
industrial-scale POI prediction applications, incorporating world knowledge and
alignment of human cognition, such as seasons, weather conditions, holidays,
and users' profiles (such as habits, occupation, and preferences), can enhance
the user experience while improving recommendation performance. To address
these issues, we propose CoAST (Cognitive-Aligned Spatial-Temporal LLMs), a
framework employing natural language as an interface, allowing for the
incorporation of world knowledge, spatio-temporal trajectory patterns,
profiles, and situational information. Specifically, CoAST mainly comprises of
2 stages: (1) Recommendation Knowledge Acquisition through continued
pretraining on the enriched spatial-temporal trajectory data of the
desensitized users; (2) Cognitive Alignment to align cognitive judgments with
human preferences using enriched training data through Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and a subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase. Extensive offline
experiments on various real-world datasets and online experiments deployed in
"Guess Where You Go" of AMAP App homepage demonstrate the effectiveness of
CoAST.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces ToolPRM, an inference scaling framework that combines fine-grained beam search with a process reward model to improve LLM performance in function calling tasks through step-level supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current inference scaling research focuses on unstructured output generation, leaving structured outputs like function calling underexplored, despite LLMs' growing capabilities as autonomous agents.

Method: Proposed an inference scaling framework with fine-grained beam search and ToolPRM process reward model, trained on the first fine-grained intra-call process supervision dataset automatically annotated using function-masking techniques.

Result: ToolPRM outperforms coarse-grained and outcome reward models in predictive accuracy, and inference scaling with ToolPRM significantly improves backbone model performance across various function calling tasks and benchmarks.

Conclusion: Revealed key principle for applying inference scaling to structured outputs: "explore more but retain less" due to the unrecoverability characteristics of structured function calling generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly demonstrating strong
capabilities as autonomous agents, with function calling serving as a core
mechanism for interaction with the environment. Meanwhile, inference scaling
has become a cutting-edge technique to enhance LLM performance by allocating
more computational resources during the inference process. However, current
research on inference scaling primarily focuses on unstructured output
generation tasks, leaving its application in structured outputs, like function
calling, largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose an inference
scaling framework that combines fine-grained beam search with a process reward
model, ToolPRM, which scores the internal steps of each single function call.
To train ToolPRM, we construct the first fine-grained intra-call process
supervision dataset, automatically annotated with function-masking techniques
to provide step-level rewards for structured tool-use reasoning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ToolPRM beats the coarse-grained and outcome
reward models in terms of predictive accuracy, indicating its stronger
capability in supervising the function calling inference process. Inference
scaling technique equipped with ToolPRM also significantly improves the
backbone model performance across various function calling tasks and
benchmarks. More importantly, we reveal a key principle for applying inference
scaling techniques to structured outputs: "explore more but retain less" due to
the unrecoverability characteristics of structured function calling generation.

*Ruotian Peng,Yi Ren,Zhouliang Yu,Weiyang Liu,Yandong Wen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLVR methods in LLMs suffer from exploitation bias, reducing pass@K performance. SimKO addresses this by asymmetrically adjusting probabilities - boosting top-K candidates for correct responses and penalizing top-1 for incorrect ones, especially at high-entropy tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prevailing RLVR methods show systematic bias toward exploitation over exploration, evidenced by improved pass@1 but reduced pass@K (K>1) performance. Analysis reveals probability concentration effect where top-1 candidate accumulates mass and suppresses others.

Method: SimKO (Simple Pass@K Optimization) operates asymmetrically: for verified-correct responses, it boosts probabilities of top-K candidates; for verified-incorrect responses, it applies stronger penalties to top-1 candidate. This is particularly effective at high-entropy tokens.

Result: Across various math and logical-reasoning benchmarks, SimKO consistently yields higher pass@K for a wide range of K, effectively mitigating the over-concentration issue and improving RLVR's exploration capabilities.

Conclusion: SimKO provides a simple yet effective method to address the exploitation bias in RLVR methods, encouraging better exploration while maintaining performance across different K values in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, prevailing
RLVR methods exhibit a systematic bias toward exploitation over exploration, as
evidenced by improved pass@1 but reduced pass@K (K>1) performance. To
understand this issue, we analyze training dynamics of RLVR methods by tracking
the token-level probability distributions over vocabulary candidates. Our
analysis reveals a consistent probability concentration effect where the top-1
candidate increasingly accumulates probability mass and suppresses that of
other candidates. More importantly, stronger over-concentration correlates with
worse pass@K performance. Inspired by this finding, we propose Simple Pass@K
Optimization (SimKO), a method designed to mitigate the over-concentration
issue, thereby encouraging exploration. SimKO operates in an asymmetrical
manner. For verified-correct responses, it boosts the probabilities of the
top-K candidates. For verified-incorrect responses, it applies stronger
penalties to the top-1 candidate. We observe that this asymmetric design is
particularly effective at mitigating over-concentration when applied at tokens
with high entropy. Across various math and logical-reasoning benchmarks, SimKO
consistently yields higher pass@K for a wide range of K, providing a simple way
to improve RLVR's exploration.

### [143] [Agentic NL2SQL to Reduce Computational Costs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14808)
*Dominik Jehle,Lennart Purucker,Frank Hutter*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Datalake Agent is an agentic system that reduces token usage by 87% in NL2SQL tasks through selective meta-information retrieval instead of processing all database information at once.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LLM-based NL2SQL methods require processing large amounts of database meta-information, leading to lengthy prompts with high token counts and processing costs.

Method: Uses an interactive loop where the LLM selectively requests only necessary meta-information through a reasoning framework, rather than calling the LLM once with all database information.

Result: Achieved up to 87% reduction in token usage while maintaining competitive performance on 23 databases with 100 table question answering tasks.

Conclusion: The Datalake Agent enables more efficient NL2SQL processing through selective information retrieval, substantially reducing costs without compromising performance.

Abstract: Translating natural language queries into SQL queries (NL2SQL or Text-to-SQL)
has recently been empowered by large language models (LLMs). Using LLMs to
perform NL2SQL methods on a large collection of SQL databases necessitates
processing large quantities of meta-information about the databases, which in
turn results in lengthy prompts with many tokens and high processing costs. To
address this challenge, we introduce Datalake Agent, an agentic system designed
to enable an LLM to solve NL2SQL tasks more efficiently. Instead of utilizing
direct solvers for NL2SQL that call the LLM once with all meta-information in
the prompt, the Datalake Agent employs an interactive loop to reduce the
utilized meta-information. Within the loop, the LLM is used in a reasoning
framework that selectively requests only the necessary information to solve a
table question answering task. We evaluate the Datalake Agent on a collection
of 23 databases with 100 table question answering tasks. The Datalake Agent
reduces the tokens used by the LLM by up to 87\% and thus allows for
substantial cost reductions while maintaining competitive performance.

*Ben Elder,Evelyn Duesterwald,Vinod Muthusamy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Instruction Boosting is a post-generation method that improves LLM instruction following rates by up to 7 points for two instructions and 4 points for ten instructions, addressing the problem of performance degradation when adding more prompt instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers often manipulate prompts by adding instructions to influence LLM behavior, but there's little assurance that additional instructions will actually be followed, and performance typically degrades as more instructions are added.

Method: Introduces Instruction Boosting as a post-generation method to increase LLM instruction following reliability, and presents SCALEDIF benchmark with scaled instruction volume up to ten instructions per sample. Also develops a quantitative conflict scoring tool to analyze instruction tension.

Result: Instruction Boosting improves instruction following rate by up to 7 points for two instructions and 4 points for ten instructions. Analysis shows performance degradation with more instructions is largely due to tension and conflict between instructions.

Conclusion: Instruction Boosting effectively addresses LLM instruction following reliability, and the conflict scoring tool provides developers with feedback on how additional prompt instructions impact model performance, explaining the observed performance degradation trends.

Abstract: A typical approach developers follow to influence an LLM's behavior in an
application is through careful manipulation of the prompt, such as by adding or
modifying instructions. However, merely adding more instructions provides
little assurance that they will actually be followed. We introduce Instruction
Boosting as a post-generation method to increase the reliability of LLM prompt
instructions. We show that Instruction Boosting improves the instruction
following rate by up to 7 points for two instructions and up to 4 points for
ten instructions. To demonstrate these results we introduce SCALEDIF, a
benchmark with a scaled instruction volume of up to ten instructions per data
sample. We also present an analysis of the commonly observed trend that
performance degrades as more instructions are added. We show that an important
factor contributing to this trend is the degree of tension and conflict that
arises as the number of instructions is increased. We contribute a quantitative
conflict scoring tool that explains the observed performance trends and
provides feedback to developers on the impact that additional prompt
instructions have on a model's performance.

### [145] [Where to Search: Measure the Prior-Structured Search Space of LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14846)
*Zhuo-Yang Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a formal theory to measure LLM-assisted iterative search using domain priors, representing agents as fuzzy relation operators with safety envelopes, and introducing coverage generating functions to analyze reachability and search difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically encode domain priors into structured hypothesis spaces for LLM-based iterative search, addressing the gap in formal descriptions of how LLMs guide multi-step reasoning and program discovery.

Method: Represents agents as fuzzy relation operators constrained by safety envelopes, weights all reachable paths with continuation parameters, sums them into coverage generating functions, and measures reachability difficulty with geometric interpretations on induced graphs.

Result: Developed a compact formal theory with testable inferences validated via majority-vote instantiation, providing operational tools to measure agents and their search spaces in LLM-assisted iterative paradigms.

Conclusion: The theory offers a systematic formal language and tools for describing and measuring iterative search constructed by LLMs, enabling better understanding and optimization of LLM-guided reasoning processes.

Abstract: The generate-filter-refine (iterative paradigm) based on large language
models (LLMs) has achieved progress in reasoning, programming, and program
discovery in AI+Science. However, the effectiveness of search depends on where
to search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally
structured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal
theory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by
domain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and
outputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a
fixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all
reachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a
coverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability
difficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph
induced by the safety envelope. We further provide the simplest testable
inferences and validate them via a majority-vote instantiation. This theory
offers a workable language and operational tools to measure agents and their
search spaces, proposing a systematic formal description of iterative search
constructed by LLMs.

TL;DR: The Gatekeeper Protocol addresses LLM limitations in autonomous agents by using a latent state approach and JSON-based interactions to improve reliability and efficiency when working with complex systems like codebases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs deployed as autonomous agents face practical constraints from limited context windows and state desynchronization, leading to unreliable output and inefficient resource usage when interacting with large, structured knowledge systems.

Method: Introduces the Gatekeeper Protocol framework where agents first operate on minimalist latent state representations, then strategically request high-fidelity context on demand through unified JSON format interactions that maintain state synchronization.

Result: The protocol significantly increases agent reliability, improves computational efficiency by minimizing token consumption, and enables scalable interaction with complex systems.

Conclusion: The Gatekeeper Protocol creates a foundational methodology for building more robust, predictable, and grounded AI agents for any structured knowledge domain.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents,
yet their practical utility is fundamentally constrained by a limited context
window and state desynchronization resulting from the LLMs' stateless nature
and inefficient context management. These limitations lead to unreliable
output, unpredictable behavior, and inefficient resource usage, particularly
when interacting with large, structured, and sensitive knowledge systems such
as codebases and documents. To address these challenges, we introduce the
Gatekeeper Protocol, a novel, domain-agnostic framework that governs
agent-system interactions. Our protocol mandates that the agent first operate
and reason on a minimalist, low-fidelity "latent state" representation of the
system to strategically request high-fidelity context on demand. All
interactions are mediated through a unified JSON format that serves as a
declarative, state-synchronized protocol, ensuring the agent's model of the
system remains verifiably grounded in the system's reality. We demonstrate the
efficacy of this protocol with Sage, a reference implementation of the
Gatekeeper Protocol for software development. Our results show that this
approach significantly increases agent reliability, improves computational
efficiency by minimizing token consumption, and enables scalable interaction
with complex systems, creating a foundational methodology for building more
robust, predictable, and grounded AI agents for any structured knowledge
domain.

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning agent that self-improves schema mapping for enterprise logs without labeled data or model updates, using web searches to gather evidence and confidence-based rewards to refine mappings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprise intelligence platforms need to integrate logs from third-party vendors, but vendor documentation is often unavailable, misplaced, or incomplete, making schema mapping challenging.

Method: Reinforcement learning agent that during inference: 1) identifies ambiguous field-mapping attempts, 2) generates targeted web-search queries for external evidence, 3) applies confidence-based rewards to iteratively refine mappings without labeled examples or model weight updates.

Result: Increased mapping accuracy from 56.4% (LLM-only) to 72.73% (RAG) to 93.94% over 100 iterations using GPT-4o, while reducing low-confidence mappings requiring expert review by 85% when converting Microsoft Defender for Endpoint logs to a common schema.

Conclusion: This approach provides an evidence-driven, transparent method for solving industry problems, enabling more robust, accountable, scalable, efficient, flexible, adaptable, and collaborative solutions.

Abstract: The Enterprise Intelligence Platform must integrate logs from numerous
third-party vendors in order to perform various downstream tasks. However,
vendor documentation is often unavailable at test time. It is either misplaced,
mismatched, poorly formatted, or incomplete, which makes schema mapping
challenging. We introduce a reinforcement learning agent that can self-improve
without labeled examples or model weight updates. During inference, the agent:
1) Identifies ambiguous field-mapping attempts. 2) Generates targeted
web-search queries to gather external evidence. 3) Applies a confidence-based
reward to iteratively refine its mappings. To demonstrate this concept, we
converted Microsoft Defender for Endpoint logs into a common schema. Our method
increased mapping accuracy from 56.4\%(LLM-only) to 72.73\%(RAG) to 93.94\%
over 100 iterations using GPT-4o. At the same time, it reduced the number of
low-confidence mappings requiring expert review by 85\%. This new approach
provides an evidence-driven, transparent method for solving future industry
problems, paving the way for more robust, accountable, scalable, efficient,
flexible, adaptable, and collaborative solutions.

TL;DR: Hybrid approach combining discriminative verifiers with self-consistency outperforms costly generative verification methods while being computationally efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative verification methods for LLMs are computationally expensive, limiting practical deployment. Need for budget-aware alternatives that maintain high performance.

Method: Discriminative verification combined with self-consistency in a hybrid approach, operating under fixed compute budgets.

Result: Achieved up to 15.3% higher accuracy on AIME2025 compared to state-of-the-art generative verification methods.

Conclusion: Budget-aware scaling with discriminative verifiers is an efficient and effective alternative to costly generative techniques, providing 'free' upgrades over self-consistency.

Abstract: Test-time scaling is a powerful strategy for boosting the performance of
large language models on complex reasoning tasks. While state-of-the-art
approaches often employ generative verifiers to select the best solution from a
pool of candidates, this method incurs prohibitive computational costs,
limiting its practicality. In this work, we shift the focus to a more
budget-aware paradigm: discriminative verification. We conduct a thorough
empirical analysis and demonstrate that while discriminative verifiers may
underperform in isolation, combining them with self-consistency in a hybrid
approach creates a powerful and efficient test-time scaling mechanism. Notably,
under a fixed compute budget, this hybrid approach surpasses state-of-the-art
generative verification by a significant margin: achieving up to 15.3\% higher
accuracy on AIME2025. Our findings establish that for practical, real-world
applications, budget-aware scaling with discriminative verifiers is not only a
"free" upgrade over self-consistency, but also a more effective and efficient
alternative to costly generative techniques. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in existing depression detection studies including limited scope, lack of systematic feature comparisons, and inconsistent evaluation protocols.

Method: Systematically evaluated feature representations (handcrafted vs pretrained embeddings), neural encoders, unimodal/bimodal/trimodal configurations, and fusion strategies with consistent subject-independent splits.

Result: Combination of EEG, speech and text enhances detection; pretrained embeddings outperform handcrafted features; carefully designed trimodal models achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The work lays groundwork for future multimodal depression detection research, demonstrating the value of systematic multimodal approaches with robust evaluation protocols.

Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental health disorder, yet its automatic
detection remains challenging. Prior work has explored unimodal and multimodal
approaches, with multimodal systems showing promise by leveraging complementary
signals. However, existing studies are limited in scope, lack systematic
comparisons of features, and suffer from inconsistent evaluation protocols. We
address these gaps by systematically exploring feature representations and
modelling strategies across EEG, together with speech and text. We evaluate
handcrafted features versus pre-trained embeddings, assess the effectiveness of
different neural encoders, compare unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal
configurations, and analyse fusion strategies with attention to the role of
EEG. Consistent subject-independent splits are applied to ensure robust,
reproducible benchmarking. Our results show that (i) the combination of EEG,
speech and text modalities enhances multimodal detection, (ii) pretrained
embeddings outperform handcrafted features, and (iii) carefully designed
trimodal models achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our work lays the
groundwork for future research in multimodal depression detection.

Motivation: To bridge Kantian philosophy with control theory by viewing reason as a regulator that maintains inference within experiential bounds, and to develop principled methods for diagnosing overconfidence in AI systems.

Method: Formalized Kant's intuition via H-Risk index combining spectral margin, conditioning, temporal sensitivity, and innovation amplification; tested on linear-Gaussian simulations and extended to analyze LLMs' internal dynamics and prompt effects.

Result: Higher H-Risk predicts overconfident errors even under formal stability; fragile internal dynamics in LLMs correlate with miscalibration and hallucination; critique-style prompts show mixed effects on calibration and hallucination.

Conclusion: Establishes a structural bridge between Kantian self-limitation and feedback control, offering a principled framework for diagnosing and selectively reducing overconfidence in reasoning systems.

Abstract: We reinterpret Kant's Critique of Pure Reason as a theory of feedback
stability, viewing reason as a regulator that keeps inference within the bounds
of possible experience. We formalize this intuition via a composite instability
index (H-Risk) combining spectral margin, conditioning, temporal sensitivity,
and innovation amplification. In linear-Gaussian simulations, higher H-Risk
predicts overconfident errors even under formal stability, revealing a gap
between nominal and epistemic stability. Extending to large language models
(LLMs), we find that fragile internal dynamics correlate with miscalibration
and hallucination, while critique-style prompts show mixed effects on
calibration and hallucination. These results suggest a structural bridge
between Kantian self-limitation and feedback control, offering a principled
lens for diagnosing -- and selectively reducing -- overconfidence in reasoning
systems. This is a preliminary version; supplementary experiments and broader
replication will be reported in a future revision.

### [152] [GroundedPRM: Tree-Guided and Fidelity-Aware Process Reward Modeling for Step-Level Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14942)
*Yao Zhang,Yu Wu,Haowei Zhang,Weiguo Li,Haokun Chen,Jingpei Wu,Guohao Li,Zhen Han,Volker Tresp*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GroundedPRM is a framework that improves process reward models for LLMs by using Monte Carlo Tree Search and external tool verification to provide accurate, hallucination-free supervision of intermediate reasoning steps, achieving state-of-the-art performance with only 10% of the data used by previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Process Reward Models (PRMs) face challenges including noisy rewards from Monte Carlo estimation, low factual fidelity due to LLM hallucination in self-evaluation, and misalignment with step-level reasoning objectives, all stemming from the lack of scalable, high-quality annotations.

Method: Uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to construct structured reasoning paths for fine-grained credit assignment, validates intermediate steps with external tools to eliminate hallucination, employs hybrid reward aggregation combining tool verification and MCTS feedback, and formats rewards into rationale-enhanced generative structures for interpretability.

Result: Achieves up to 26% relative improvement in average performance on ProcessBench, outperforms PRMs trained with human-labeled supervision when used for reward-guided greedy search, and requires only 40K automatically labeled samples (10% of previous best auto-labeled PRM data).

Conclusion: GroundedPRM provides a scalable and verifiable path toward high-quality process-level reasoning by addressing core limitations of existing PRMs through tree-guided, fidelity-aware automatic process supervision.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to improve multi-step reasoning in Large
Language Models (LLMs) by supervising intermediate steps and identifying
errors. However, building effective PRMs remains challenging due to the lack of
scalable, high-quality annotations. Existing approaches rely on costly human
labeling, LLM-based self-evaluation that is prone to hallucination, or Monte
Carlo (MC) estimation, which infers step quality solely from rollout outcomes
and often introduces noisy, misaligned supervision due to credit
misattribution. These issues result in three core limitations: noisy rewards,
low factual fidelity, and misalignment with step-level reasoning objectives. To
address these challenges, we introduce GroundedPRM, a tree-guided and
fidelity-aware framework for automatic process supervision. To reduce reward
noise and enable fine-grained credit assignment, we construct structured
reasoning paths via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). To eliminate hallucinated
supervision, we validate each intermediate step using an external tool,
providing execution-grounded correctness signals. To combine both step-level
validation and global outcome assessment, we design a hybrid reward aggregation
mechanism that fuses tool-based verification with MCTS-derived feedback.
Finally, we format the reward signal into a rationale-enhanced, generative
structure to promote interpretability and compatibility with instruction-tuned
LLMs. GroundedPRM is trained on only 40K automatically labeled samples,
amounting to just 10% of the data used by the best-performing PRM trained with
auto-labeled supervision. Nevertheless, it achieves up to a 26% relative
improvement in average performance on ProcessBench. When used for reward-guided
greedy search, GroundedPRM outperforms even PRMs trained with human-labeled
supervision, offering a scalable and verifiable path toward high-quality
process-level reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs are tested for compositional machine design using BesiegeField testbed, with RL finetuning explored to improve capabilities in spatial reasoning and strategic assembly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether large language models can learn to create complex machines through compositional design, building on recent LLM advances.

Method: Introduces BesiegeField testbed based on Besiege game for part-based construction and physical simulation. Benchmarks LLMs with agentic workflows and explores RL finetuning using curated datasets.

Result: Current open-source LLMs fall short in machine design capabilities, particularly in spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and instruction-following.

Conclusion: Highlights open challenges at the intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning, suggesting RL as a promising path for improvement.

Abstract: The design of complex machines stands as both a marker of human intelligence
and a foundation of engineering practice. Given recent advances in large
language models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We
approach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task
in which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional
demands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. To
support this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the
machine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical
simulation and reward-driven evaluation. Using BesiegeField, we benchmark
state-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and identify key capabilities
required for success, including spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and
instruction-following. As current open-source models fall short, we explore
reinforcement learning (RL) as a path to improvement: we curate a cold-start
dataset, conduct RL finetuning experiments, and highlight open challenges at
the intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning.

### [154] [Towards Unified Multimodal Misinformation Detection in Social Media: A Benchmark Dataset and Baseline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25991)
*Haiyang Li,Yaxiong Wang,Shengeng Tang,Lianwei Wu,Lechao Cheng,Zhun Zhong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces OmniFake dataset and UMFDet framework for unified detection of both human-crafted misinformation and AI-generated fake content in multimodal news, addressing the gap between specialized NLP and CV approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fake content detection systems are specialized for either human-written misinformation (NLP focus) or AI-generated content (CV focus), but real-world scenarios involve unknown content types, limiting practical effectiveness.

Method: Proposed UMFDet framework uses VLM backbone with Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts Adapter to capture category-specific cues, and attribution chain-of-thought mechanism for implicit reasoning guidance to locate deceptive signals.

Result: Extensive experiments show UMFDet achieves robust and consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming specialized baselines.

Conclusion: UMFDet offers a practical unified solution for real-world multimodal deception detection, bridging the gap between isolated research approaches.

Abstract: In recent years, detecting fake multimodal content on social media has drawn
increasing attention. Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted
misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content
produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although
both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP
research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community
targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often
specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios,
however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the
effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the
Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive
benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from
existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this
dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a
framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM
backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to
capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism
that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive
signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and
consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming
specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world
multimodal deception detection.

*Mingyang Jiang,Yueyuan Li,Jiaru Zhang,Songan Zhang,Ming Yang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DRIP is a diffusion-refined planner that uses RL-pretrained policy as prior action distribution to improve parking planning in confined spaces, achieving higher success rates and reduced inference steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing demand for automated parking planning in confined spaces requires high-precision maneuvers, but existing approaches struggle with accurately modeling optimal action distributions.

Method: Combines RL-pretrained policy as prior action distribution with diffusion model refinement, where denoising process refines coarse priors into precise action distributions.

Result: Significantly improves planning performance in confined-space parking environments while maintaining strong generalization in common scenarios.

Conclusion: DRIP effectively addresses the challenge of accurate action modeling in complex parking environments by leveraging RL priors to guide diffusion training.

Abstract: The growing demand for parking has increased the need for automated parking
planning methods that can operate reliably in confined spaces. In restricted
and complex environments, high-precision maneuvers are required to achieve a
high success rate in planning, yet existing approaches often rely on explicit
action modeling, which faces challenges when accurately modeling the optimal
action distribution. In this paper, we propose DRIP, a diffusion-refined
planner anchored in reinforcement learning (RL) prior action distribution, in
which an RL-pretrained policy provides prior action distributions to regularize
the diffusion training process. During the inference phase the denoising
process refines these coarse priors into more precise action distributions. By
steering the denoising trajectory through the reinforcement learning prior
distribution during training, the diffusion model inherits a well-informed
initialization, resulting in more accurate action modeling, a higher planning
success rate, and reduced inference steps. We evaluate our approach across
parking scenarios with varying degrees of spatial constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method significantly improves planning performance
in confined-space parking environments while maintaining strong generalization
in common scenarios.

### [156] [Spatially Intelligent Patrol Routes for Concealed Emitter Localization by Robot Swarms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14018)
*Adam Morris,Timothy Pelham,Edmund R. Hunt*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a method using differential evolution to generate geometric patrol routes for robot swarms to localize concealed radio emitters, showing that directional antennas achieve 98.75% success rate vs 80.25% for omnidirectional antennas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of localizing unknown radio signals independently of emitter parameters in electromagnetic surveillance, which is difficult due to varying signal properties.

Method: Used differential evolution to generate geometric patrol routes for a four-robot swarm across eight configurations with different patrol shapes and antenna types (omnidirectional or directional), simulating emitter localization with randomized position, power, and frequency.

Result: Directional antennas achieved 98.75% average detection success rate with localization errors of 1.01-1.30 m, while omnidirectional antennas achieved 80.25% success rate with 1.67-1.90 m errors. Directional sensing also benefited from shorter patrol edges.

Conclusion: A swarm's ability to predict electromagnetic phenomena depends on its physical interaction with the environment, making spatial intelligence through optimized patrol routes and antenna selection critical for effective robotic surveillance.

Abstract: This paper introduces a method for designing spatially intelligent robot
swarm behaviors to localize concealed radio emitters. We use differential
evolution to generate geometric patrol routes that localize unknown signals
independently of emitter parameters, a key challenge in electromagnetic
surveillance. Patrol shape and antenna type are shown to influence information
gain, which in turn determines the effective triangulation coverage. We
simulate a four-robot swarm across eight configurations, assigning
pre-generated patrol routes based on a specified patrol shape and sensing
capability (antenna type: omnidirectional or directional). An emitter is placed
within the map for each trial, with randomized position, transmission power and
frequency. Results show that omnidirectional localization success rates are
driven primarily by source location rather than signal properties, with
failures occurring most often when sources are placed in peripheral areas of
the map. Directional antennas are able to overcome this limitation due to their
higher gain and directivity, with an average detection success rate of 98.75%
compared to 80.25% for omnidirectional. Average localization errors range from
1.01-1.30 m for directional sensing and 1.67-1.90 m for omnidirectional
sensing; while directional sensing also benefits from shorter patrol edges.
These results demonstrate that a swarm's ability to predict electromagnetic
phenomena is directly dependent on its physical interaction with the
environment. Consequently, spatial intelligence, realized here through
optimized patrol routes and antenna selection, is a critical design
consideration for effective robotic surveillance.

Conclusion: OATH successfully advances MATP by introducing obstacle-aware strategies that enable effective coordination among heterogeneous robots while maintaining scalability and near-optimal allocation performance.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Task Assignment and Planning (MATP) has attracted growing
attention but remains challenging in terms of scalability, spatial reasoning,
and adaptability in obstacle-rich environments. To address these challenges, we
propose OATH: Adaptive Obstacle-Aware Task Assignment and Planning for
Heterogeneous Robot Teaming, which advances MATP by introducing a novel
obstacle-aware strategy for task assignment. First, we develop an adaptive
Halton sequence map, the first known application of Halton sampling with
obstacle-aware adaptation in MATP, which adjusts sampling density based on
obstacle distribution. Second, we propose a cluster-auction-selection framework
that integrates obstacle-aware clustering with weighted auctions and
intra-cluster task selection. These mechanisms jointly enable effective
coordination among heterogeneous robots while maintaining scalability and
near-optimal allocation performance. In addition, our framework leverages an
LLM to interpret human instructions and directly guide the planner in real
time. We validate OATH in NVIDIA Isaac Sim, showing substantial improvements in
task assignment quality, scalability, adaptability to dynamic changes, and
overall execution performance compared to state-of-the-art MATP baselines. A

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper integrates Reinforcement Learning (RL) skills into Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) pipelines to handle probabilistic actions and uncertainties in robotics manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TAMP struggles with planning probabilistic actions under uncertainty, while RL excels at learning robust short-horizon manipulation skills but lacks long-horizon reasoning capabilities.

Method: The method defines RL skills with data-driven logical components for symbolic planning integration and includes a plan refinement sub-routine to handle effect uncertainties.

Result: The approach extends TAMP's capability to domains with probabilistic skills and improves planning efficiency compared to baseline hierarchical planning methods.

Conclusion: Integrating RL skills into TAMP pipelines successfully bridges the gap between long-horizon reasoning and robust skill execution under uncertainty.

Abstract: Task and motion planning (TAMP) for robotics manipulation necessitates
long-horizon reasoning involving versatile actions and skills. While
deterministic actions can be crafted by sampling or optimizing with certain
constraints, planning actions with uncertainty, i.e., probabilistic actions,
remains a challenge for TAMP. On the contrary, Reinforcement Learning (RL)
excels in acquiring versatile, yet short-horizon, manipulation skills that are
robust with uncertainties. In this letter, we design a method that integrates
RL skills into TAMP pipelines. Besides the policy, a RL skill is defined with
data-driven logical components that enable the skill to be deployed by symbolic
planning. A plan refinement sub-routine is designed to further tackle the
inevitable effect uncertainties. In the experiments, we compare our method with
baseline hierarchical planning from both TAMP and RL fields and illustrate the
strength of the method. The results show that by embedding RL skills, we extend
the capability of TAMP to domains with probabilistic skills, and improve the
planning efficiency compared to the previous methods.

Conclusion: The proposed PFL-based control approach effectively stabilizes suspended aerial platforms with loads, making it suitable for construction site applications where only onboard sensors are available, with proven robustness against various disturbances.

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel control approach based on partial feedback

robustness analysis of the proposed approach in the presence of external wind
disturbances, sensor noise, and uncertainties in system dynamics. As our

TL;DR: ViTacGen is a robot manipulation framework that generates tactile feedback from visual inputs for robotic pushing tasks, eliminating the need for real tactile sensors and enabling zero-shot deployment on visual-only systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real tactile sensors face hardware limitations (high cost, fragility) and deployment challenges (calibration, sensor variations), while vision-only policies perform poorly. Humans can infer tactile states from vision, inspiring a vision-to-touch generation approach.

Method: ViTacGen uses an encoder-decoder network to generate contact depth images (standardized tactile representation) from visual image sequences, followed by a reinforcement learning policy that fuses visual-tactile data using contrastive learning based on visual and generated tactile observations.

Result: The approach was validated in both simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating superior performance with success rates up to 86%.

Conclusion: ViTacGen effectively eliminates reliance on high-resolution real tactile sensors and enables successful zero-shot deployment on visual-only robotic systems for pushing tasks.

Abstract: Robotic pushing is a fundamental manipulation task that requires tactile
feedback to capture subtle contact forces and dynamics between the end-effector
and the object. However, real tactile sensors often face hardware limitations
such as high costs and fragility, and deployment challenges involving
calibration and variations between different sensors, while vision-only
policies struggle with satisfactory performance. Inspired by humans' ability to
infer tactile states from vision, we propose ViTacGen, a novel robot
manipulation framework designed for visual robotic pushing with vision-to-touch
generation in reinforcement learning to eliminate the reliance on
high-resolution real tactile sensors, enabling effective zero-shot deployment
on visual-only robotic systems. Specifically, ViTacGen consists of an
encoder-decoder vision-to-touch generation network that generates contact depth
images, a standardized tactile representation, directly from visual image
sequence, followed by a reinforcement learning policy that fuses visual-tactile
data with contrastive learning based on visual and generated tactile
observations. We validate the effectiveness of our approach in both simulation

TL;DR: A model-free approach for robotic shape control of 3D deformable objects using key point constraints and visual servoing with prescribed performance control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manipulating 3D deformable objects is challenging due to infinite-dimensional state space and complex dynamics, requiring simplified control methods.

Method: Uses key points from point clouds as feature vectors, formulates as visual servoing problem with deformation Jacobian matrix, and applies prescribed performance control with barrier Lyapunov functions.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate the method's effectiveness and robustness in shape control of deformable objects.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully simplifies deformable object manipulation while maintaining spatial information and ensuring stability through rigorous Lyapunov analysis.

Abstract: Manipulating three-dimensional (3D) deformable objects presents significant
challenges for robotic systems due to their infinite-dimensional state space
and complex deformable dynamics. This paper proposes a novel model-free
approach for shape control with constraints imposed on key points. Unlike
existing methods that rely on feature dimensionality reduction, the proposed
controller leverages the coordinates of key points as the feature vector, which
are extracted from the deformable object's point cloud using deep learning
methods. This approach not only reduces the dimensionality of the feature space
but also retains the spatial information of the object. By extracting key
points, the manipulation of deformable objects is simplified into a visual
servoing problem, where the shape dynamics are described using a deformation
Jacobian matrix. To enhance control accuracy, a prescribed performance control
method is developed by integrating barrier Lyapunov functions (BLF) to enforce
constraints on the key points. The stability of the closed-loop system is
rigorously analyzed and verified using the Lyapunov method. Experimental
results further demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed
method.

Conclusion: The method enables compliant human-humanoid collaborative carrying without requiring external sensors or complex interaction models, offering a practical solution for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Human-humanoid collaboration shows significant promise for applications in
healthcare, domestic assistance, and manufacturing. While compliant robot-human
collaboration has been extensively developed for robotic arms, enabling
compliant human-humanoid collaboration remains largely unexplored due to
humanoids' complex whole-body dynamics. In this paper, we propose a
proprioception-only reinforcement learning approach, COLA, that combines leader

by 24.7%. compared to baseline approaches while maintaining object stability.
Real-world experiments validate robust collaborative carrying across different
object types (boxes, desks, stretchers, etc.) and movement patterns
(straight-line, turning, slope climbing). Human user studies with 23

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in scaling VLA models: high computational costs of training from scratch, data scarcity in robotics, and the need to balance model capacity with real-time computational efficiency.

Method: Proposes AdaMoE architecture that inherits pretrained VLA weights and substitutes feedforward layers with sparsely activated MoE layers. Uses decoupling technique with independent scale adapter alongside router to separate expert selection from expert weighting.

Result: Outperforms baseline model with 1.8% improvement on LIBERO, 9.3% on RoboTwin, and 21.5% improvement in real-world experiments for robotic manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: Collaborative expert utilization through decoupled selection and weighting enables superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency, demonstrating that expertise need not monopolize in VLA model scaling.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are experiencing rapid development and
demonstrating promising capabilities in robotic manipulation tasks. However,
scaling up VLA models presents several critical challenges: (1) Training new
VLA models from scratch demands substantial computational resources and
extensive datasets. Given the current scarcity of robot data, it becomes
particularly valuable to fully leverage well-pretrained VLA model weights
during the scaling process. (2) Real-time control requires carefully balancing
model capacity with computational efficiency. To address these challenges, We
propose AdaMoE, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that inherits
pretrained weights from dense VLA models, and scales up the action expert by
substituting the feedforward layers into sparsely activated MoE layers. AdaMoE
employs a decoupling technique that decouples expert selection from expert
weighting through an independent scale adapter working alongside the
traditional router. This enables experts to be selected based on task relevance
while contributing with independently controlled weights, allowing
collaborative expert utilization rather than winner-takes-all dynamics. Our
approach demonstrates that expertise need not monopolize. Instead, through
collaborative expert utilization, we can achieve superior performance while
maintaining computational efficiency. AdaMoE consistently outperforms the
baseline model across key benchmarks, delivering performance gains of 1.8% on
LIBERO and 9.3% on RoboTwin. Most importantly, a substantial 21.5% improvement
in real-world experiments validates its practical effectiveness for robotic
manipulation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop robust quadrupedal locomotion policies that can adapt to unknown environments and ensure performance across varying risk levels.

Method: Train a family of risk-conditioned policies using Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) constrained policy optimization, then adaptively select the best policy using a multi-armed bandit framework based on observed episodic returns.

Result: Achieved nearly twice the mean and tail performance in unseen environments compared to baselines, with bandit-based adaptation selecting the best risk-aware policy within two minutes of operation in unknown terrain.

Conclusion: The proposed risk-aware reinforcement learning approach with adaptive policy selection enables robust quadrupedal locomotion in unknown environments without privileged information.

Abstract: In this work, we study risk-aware reinforcement learning for quadrupedal
locomotion. Our approach trains a family of risk-conditioned policies using a
Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) constrained policy optimization technique that
provides improved stability and sample efficiency. At deployment, we adaptively
select the best performing policy from the family of policies using a
multi-armed bandit framework that uses only observed episodic returns, without
any privileged environment information, and adapts to unknown conditions on the
fly. Hence, we train quadrupedal locomotion policies at various levels of
robustness using CVaR and adaptively select the desired level of robustness
online to ensure performance in unknown environments. We evaluate our method in
simulation across eight unseen settings (by changing dynamics, contacts,
sensing noise, and terrain) and on a Unitree Go2 robot in previously unseen
terrains. Our risk-aware policy attains nearly twice the mean and tail
performance in unseen environments compared to other baselines and our
bandit-based adaptation selects the best-performing risk-aware policy in
unknown terrain within two minutes of operation.

Motivation: Current agricultural robots rely on manual operation or fixed rails, and existing VLN methods treat each navigation instruction independently, missing opportunities to leverage spatial context from repeated instructions in agricultural environments.

Method: Proposed SUM-AgriVLN with Spatial Understanding Memory module that performs 3D reconstruction and representation to save spatial memory from past navigation experiences.

Result: Improved Success Rate from 0.47 to 0.54 on A2A benchmark with minimal increase in Navigation Error from 2.91m to 2.93m, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Spatial memory through 3D reconstruction effectively enhances agricultural robot navigation by leveraging past experiences, demonstrating significant improvement over instruction-independent approaches.

Abstract: Agricultural robots are emerging as powerful assistants across a wide range
of agricultural tasks, nevertheless, still heavily rely on manual operation or
fixed rail systems for movement. The AgriVLN method and the A2A benchmark
pioneeringly extend Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) to the agricultural
domain, enabling robots to navigate to the target positions following the
natural language instructions. In practical agricultural scenarios, navigation
instructions often repeatedly occur, yet AgriVLN treat each instruction as an
independent episode, overlooking the potential of past experiences to provide
spatial context for subsequent ones. To bridge this gap, we propose the method
of Spatial Understanding Memory for Agricultural Vision-and-Language Navigation
(SUM-AgriVLN), in which the SUM module employs spatial understanding and save
spatial memory through 3D reconstruction and representation. When evaluated on
the A2A benchmark, our SUM-AgriVLN effectively improves Success Rate from 0.47
to 0.54 with slight sacrifice on Navigation Error from 2.91m to 2.93m,
demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance in the agricultural domain.

*Baris Baysal,Omid Arfaie,Ramazan Unal*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoboANKLE is a powered transtibial prosthesis that uses ESER and EES mechanisms to provide complete push-off assistance, achieving natural ankle motion with 95% accuracy on dorsi-flexion angles, 57% higher torque than required, and 10% more power than natural gait.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in active transtibial prostheses by maintaining energetic autonomy, minimizing weight, and providing natural ankle motion through extensive push-off assistance.

Method: Used ESER mechanism with novel EES mechanism, conducted kinematic/kinetic analyses, built CAD model for dynamic/structural analyses, performed topology optimization for weight minimization, and manufactured prototype for experimental evaluation.

Result: Prototype weighs 1.92kg with dimensions 261x107x420mm, achieves 95% accuracy on natural maximum dorsi-flexion angle, generates 57% higher torque than required for natural walking, and produces 10% more power than natural gait cycle.

Conclusion: RoboANKLE successfully addresses design challenges for active transtibial prostheses by providing natural-like motion with enhanced torque and power capabilities while maintaining reasonable weight and dimensions.

Abstract: This study presents a powered transtibial prosthesis with complete push-off
assistance, RoboANKLE. The design aims to fulfill specific requirements, such
as a sufficient range of motion (RoM) while providing the necessary torque for
achieving natural ankle motion in daily activities. Addressing the challenges
faced in designing active transtibial prostheses, such as maintaining energetic
autonomy and minimizing weight, is vital for the study. With this aim, we try
to imitate the human ankle by providing extensive push-off assistance to
achieve a natural-like torque profile. Thus, Energy Store and Extended Release
mechanism (ESER) is employed with a novel Extra Energy Storage (EES) mechanism.
Kinematic and kinetic analyses are carried out to determine the design
parameters and assess the design performance. Subsequently, a Computer-Aided
Design (CAD) model is built and used in comprehensive dynamic and structural
analyses. These analyses are used for the design performance evaluation and
determine the forces and torques applied to the prosthesis, which aids in
optimizing the design for minimal weight via structural analysis and topology
optimization. The design of the prototype is then finalized and manufactured
for experimental evaluation to validate the design and functionality. The
prototype is realized with a mass of 1.92 kg and dimensions of 261x107x420 mm.
The Functional evaluations of the RoboANKLE revealed that it is capable of
achieving the natural maximum dorsi-flexion angle with 95% accuracy. Also,
Thanks to the implemented mechanisms, the results show that RoboANKLE can
generate 57% higher than the required torque for natural walking. The result of
the power generation capacity of the RoboANKLE is 10% more than the natural
power during the gait cycle.

TL;DR: AdaMimic is a motion tracking algorithm that enables adaptable humanoid control from a single reference motion by creating an augmented dataset, training policies on sparse keyframes, and using adapters for flexible time warping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combine the strengths of motion prior approaches (good adaptability) and motion-tracking methods (accurate imitation) while overcoming their limitations - motion priors sacrifice accuracy and motion-tracking requires many training motions.

Method: 1) Create augmented dataset by sparsifying single reference motion into keyframes with light editing; 2) Initialize policy by tracking sparse keyframes to generate dense motions; 3) Train adapters to adjust tracking speed and refine low-level actions for flexible time warping.

Result: Significant improvements in both simulation and real-world Unitree G1 humanoid robot across multiple tasks and wide range of adaptation conditions, achieving better imitation accuracy and adaptability from single reference motion.

Conclusion: AdaMimic successfully bridges the gap between motion prior and motion-tracking approaches, enabling adaptable humanoid control with high imitation accuracy using only a single reference motion.

Abstract: Humanoid robots are envisioned to adapt demonstrated motions to diverse
real-world conditions while accurately preserving motion patterns. Existing
motion prior approaches enable well adaptability with a few motions but often
sacrifice imitation accuracy, whereas motion-tracking methods achieve accurate
imitation yet require many training motions and a test-time target motion to
adapt. To combine their strengths, we introduce AdaMimic, a novel motion
tracking algorithm that enables adaptable humanoid control from a single
reference motion. To reduce data dependence while ensuring adaptability, our
method first creates an augmented dataset by sparsifying the single reference
motion into keyframes and applying light editing with minimal physical
assumptions. A policy is then initialized by tracking these sparse keyframes to
generate dense intermediate motions, and adapters are subsequently trained to
adjust tracking speed and refine low-level actions based on the adjustment,
enabling flexible time warping that further improves imitation accuracy and
adaptability. We validate these significant improvements in our approach in
both simulation and the real-world Unitree G1 humanoid robot in multiple tasks
across a wide range of adaptation conditions. Videos and code are available at

### [168] [Restoring Noisy Demonstration for Imitation Learning With Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14467)
*Shang-Fu Chen,Co Yong,Shao-Hua Sun*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A filter-and-restore framework for imitation learning that handles noisy expert demonstrations by filtering clean samples and using conditional diffusion models to recover noisy ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most imitation learning methods assume perfect expert demonstrations, but real-world demonstrations often contain imperfections from human errors or system inaccuracies, limiting practical applicability.

Method: Proposes a two-stage framework: first filters clean samples from noisy demonstrations, then learns conditional diffusion models to restore the noisy demonstrations to their clean versions.

Result: The framework consistently outperforms existing methods across robot arm manipulation, dexterous manipulation, and locomotion tasks, showing robustness to different noise types and levels.

Conclusion: The proposed filter-and-restore framework effectively handles noisy offline demonstration data and demonstrates practical applicability for real-world imitation learning scenarios.

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) aims to learn a policy from expert demonstrations and
has been applied to various applications. By learning from the expert policy,
IL methods do not require environmental interactions or reward signals.
However, most existing imitation learning algorithms assume perfect expert
demonstrations, but expert demonstrations often contain imperfections caused by
errors from human experts or sensor/control system inaccuracies. To address the
above problems, this work proposes a filter-and-restore framework to best
leverage expert demonstrations with inherent noise. Our proposed method first
filters clean samples from the demonstrations and then learns conditional
diffusion models to recover the noisy ones. We evaluate our proposed framework
and existing methods in various domains, including robot arm manipulation,
dexterous manipulation, and locomotion. The experiment results show that our
proposed framework consistently outperforms existing methods across all the
tasks. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each component
and demonstrate the framework's robustness to different noise types and levels.
These results confirm the practical applicability of our framework to noisy
offline demonstration data.

*Mingtian Du,Suhas Raghavendra Kulkarni,Simone Kager,Domenico Campolo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper establishes analytical stability criteria for robot-mediated human-human interaction systems under network delays, identifying both delay-independent and delay-dependent stability conditions that depend on controller and robot parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address stability challenges in haptic communication systems for remote human-human interactions that are affected by network-induced time delays, which can compromise system performance and safety.

Method: Frequency-domain analysis supported by numerical simulations to derive stability criteria, with experimental validation using robots performing human-like movements.

Result: Identified two types of stability criteria: delay-independent (stable regardless of delay) and delay-dependent (characterized by maximum tolerable delay before instability). Found that increasing stiffness reduces maximum tolerable delay non-linearly, increasing system vulnerability.

Conclusion: The proposed stability criteria can be generalized to various robot-mediated interactions and serve as design guidelines for stable remote dyadic systems, providing prerequisites for effective delay-compensation strategies.

Abstract: This paper establishes analytical stability criteria for robot-mediated
human-human (dyadic) interaction systems, focusing on haptic communication
under network-induced time delays. Through frequency-domain analysis supported
by numerical simulations, we identify both delay-independent and
delay-dependent stability criteria. The delay-independent criterion guarantees
stability irrespective of the delay, whereas the delay-dependent criterion is
characterised by a maximum tolerable delay before instability occurs. The
criteria demonstrate dependence on controller and robot dynamic parameters,
where increasing stiffness reduces the maximum tolerable delay in a non-linear
manner, thereby heightening system vulnerability. The proposed criteria can be
generalised to a wide range of robot-mediated interactions and serve as design
guidelines for stable remote dyadic systems. Experiments with robots performing
human-like movements further illustrate the correlation between stability and
motor performance. The findings of this paper suggest the prerequisites for
effective delay-compensation strategies.

*Matti Pekkanen,Francesco Verdoja,Ville Kyrki*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve robotic map querying using visual-language embeddings by leveraging synonyms and antonyms to identify relevant environment parts, requiring minimal training and being representation-agnostic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional robotic maps use limited labels, while visual-language embeddings offer open-vocabulary scene understanding but struggle with determining which parts of the environment are relevant to user queries.

Method: Uses natural-language synonyms and antonyms in the embedding space with heuristics to estimate relevant language space, then trains a classifier to partition the environment into matches and non-matches for queries.

Result: Extensive experiments show increased queryability of maps and standard image benchmarks, with the method being agnostic to representation and encoder while requiring limited training.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses the challenge of determining relevant environment parts for queries using visual-language embeddings, improving map queryability through language-space analysis and classification.

Abstract: Embeddings from Visual-Language Models are increasingly utilized to represent
semantics in robotic maps, offering an open-vocabulary scene understanding that
surpasses traditional, limited labels. Embeddings enable on-demand querying by
comparing embedded user text prompts to map embeddings via a similarity metric.
The key challenge in performing the task indicated in a query is that the robot
must determine the parts of the environment relevant to the query.
  This paper proposes a solution to this challenge. We leverage
natural-language synonyms and antonyms associated with the query within the
embedding space, applying heuristics to estimate the language space relevant to
the query, and use that to train a classifier to partition the environment into
matches and non-matches. We evaluate our method through extensive experiments,
querying both maps and standard image benchmarks. The results demonstrate
increased queryability of maps and images. Our querying technique is agnostic
to the representation and encoder used, and requires limited training.

*Benno Wingender,Nils Dengler,Rohit Menon,Sicong Pan,Maren Bennewitz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A generalized placeability metric for robotic pick-and-place that evaluates placement poses directly from noisy point clouds without shape priors, enabling unified reasoning between grasping and placing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on strong object priors or planar-support assumptions, limiting generalization and unified reasoning between grasping and placing under real-world sensing noise.

Method: Extract support surfaces from raw geometry to generate multi-orientation placement candidates, sample contacts satisfying collision and stability constraints, and condition grasp scores on each candidate placement for unified pick-and-place reasoning.

Result: On unseen real objects and non-planar supports, the metric achieves CAD-comparable accuracy in predicting stability loss and produces more physically plausible placements than learning-based predictors.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables model-free unified pick-and-place reasoning and selects grasp-place pairs that lead to stable, collision-free placements without requiring shape priors.

Abstract: To reliably pick and place unknown objects under real-world sensing noise
remains a challenging task, as existing methods rely on strong object priors
(e.g., CAD models), or planar-support assumptions, limiting generalization and
unified reasoning between grasping and placing. In this work, we introduce a
generalized placeability metric that evaluates placement poses directly from
noisy point clouds, without any shape priors. The metric jointly scores
stability, graspability, and clearance. From raw geometry, we extract the
support surfaces of the object to generate diverse candidates for
multi-orientation placement and sample contacts that satisfy collision and
stability constraints. By conditioning grasp scores on each candidate
placement, our proposed method enables model-free unified pick-and-place
reasoning and selects grasp-place pairs that lead to stable, collision-free
placements. On unseen real objects and non-planar object supports, our metric
delivers CAD-comparable accuracy in predicting stability loss and generally
produces more physically plausible placements than learning-based predictors.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes encoding quadruped robot proprioceptive time-series data as 2D images to leverage CNNs for locomotion tasks, achieving 94.5% contact estimation accuracy with 15x shorter window than previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable use of convolutional neural networks for learning locomotion-related tasks by transforming proprioceptive time-series data into structured 2D images that preserve robot morphology and temporal dynamics.

Method: Encodes temporal dynamics from multiple proprioceptive signals (joint positions, IMU readings, foot velocities) into 2D images that preserve robot's morphological structure in spatial arrangement, capturing inter-signal correlations and gait patterns.

Result: Achieves 94.5% contact state accuracy, improving from 87.7% of MI-HGNN method, using 15 times shorter window size. Enhances prediction accuracy and generalization over conventional sequence-based models in both real-world and simulated environments.

Conclusion: Image-based representation consistently enhances performance for robotic state learning, demonstrating the potential of cross-modal encoding strategies for processing proprioceptive data in locomotion tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for representing proprioceptive
time-series data from quadruped robots as structured two-dimensional images,
enabling the use of convolutional neural networks for learning
locomotion-related tasks. The proposed method encodes temporal dynamics from
multiple proprioceptive signals, such as joint positions, IMU readings, and
foot velocities, while preserving the robot's morphological structure in the
spatial arrangement of the image. This transformation captures inter-signal
correlations and gait-dependent patterns, providing a richer feature space than
direct time-series processing. We apply this concept in the problem of contact
estimation, a key capability for stable and adaptive locomotion on diverse
terrains. Experimental evaluations on both real-world datasets and simulated
environments show that our image-based representation consistently enhances
prediction accuracy and generalization over conventional sequence-based models,
underscoring the potential of cross-modal encoding strategies for robotic state
learning. Our method achieves superior performance on the contact dataset,
improving contact state accuracy from 87.7% to 94.5% over the recently proposed
MI-HGNN method, using a 15 times shorter window size.

*Edward Sandra,Lander Vanroye,Dries Dirckx,Ruben Cartuyvels,Jan Swevers,Wilm Decré*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CAMPD is a diffusion-based motion planning method that uses classifier-free denoising and attention mechanisms to generalize across unseen environments without retraining, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in speed and trajectory quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical motion planning methods struggle with high-dimensional spaces and complex environments, while existing diffusion-based approaches either train per-environment or rely on specific sensors, limiting generalization.

Method: Uses a classifier-free denoising probabilistic diffusion model conditioned on sensor-agnostic contextual information with attention mechanisms in U-Net architecture to handle arbitrary contextual parameters.

Result: CAMPD successfully generalizes to unseen environments, generates high-quality multi-modal trajectories, and achieves planning times significantly faster than existing methods on 7-DoF robot manipulator tasks.

Conclusion: CAMPD demonstrates that diffusion models with proper conditioning can overcome generalization limitations in motion planning, enabling efficient adaptation to diverse scenarios without retraining or specific sensor dependencies.

Abstract: Classical methods in robot motion planning, such as sampling-based and
optimization-based methods, often struggle with scalability towards
higher-dimensional state spaces and complex environments. Diffusion models,
known for their capability to learn complex, high-dimensional and multi-modal
data distributions, provide a promising alternative when applied to motion
planning problems and have already shown interesting results. However, most of
the current approaches train their model for a single environment, limiting
their generalization to environments not seen during training. The techniques
that do train a model for multiple environments rely on a specific camera to
provide the model with the necessary environmental information and therefore
always require that sensor. To effectively adapt to diverse scenarios without
the need for retraining, this research proposes Context-Aware Motion Planning
Diffusion (CAMPD). CAMPD leverages a classifier-free denoising probabilistic
diffusion model, conditioned on sensor-agnostic contextual information. An
attention mechanism, integrated in the well-known U-Net architecture,
conditions the model on an arbitrary number of contextual parameters. CAMPD is
evaluated on a 7-DoF robot manipulator and benchmarked against state-of-the-art
approaches on real-world tasks, showing its ability to generalize to unseen
environments and generate high-quality, multi-modal trajectories, at a fraction
of the time required by existing methods.

TL;DR: GOPLA is a hierarchical framework that learns generalizable object placement from augmented human demonstrations, improving placement success rates by 30.04 percentage points over previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots need to serve as intelligent assistants for household organization, requiring reasoning about both semantic preferences (common-sense object relations) and geometric feasibility (collision avoidance) for object placement tasks.

Method: Uses a multi-modal large language model to translate human instructions into structured plans, a spatial mapper to create 3D affordance maps, and a diffusion-based planner to generate placement poses with test-time costs and collision avoidance. Includes a scalable pipeline to expand human demonstrations into synthetic training data.

Result: Improves placement success rates by 30.04 percentage points over the runner-up method, evaluated on positioning accuracy and physical plausibility.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates strong generalization across a wide range of real-world robotic placement scenarios, effectively addressing the object placement challenge in household robotics.

Abstract: Robots are expected to serve as intelligent assistants, helping humans with
everyday household organization. A central challenge in this setting is the
task of object placement, which requires reasoning about both semantic
preferences (e.g., common-sense object relations) and geometric feasibility
(e.g., collision avoidance). We present GOPLA, a hierarchical framework that
learns generalizable object placement from augmented human demonstrations. A
multi-modal large language model translates human instructions and visual
inputs into structured plans that specify pairwise object relationships. These
plans are then converted into 3D affordance maps with geometric common sense by
a spatial mapper, while a diffusion-based planner generates placement poses
guided by test-time costs, considering multi-plan distributions and collision
avoidance. To overcome data scarcity, we introduce a scalable pipeline that
expands human placement demonstrations into diverse synthetic training data.
Extensive experiments show that our approach improves placement success rates
by 30.04 percentage points over the runner-up, evaluated on positioning
accuracy and physical plausibility, demonstrating strong generalization across
a wide range of real-world robotic placement scenarios.

Motivation: To improve the efficiency of sampling-based Model Predictive Control by learning meaningful proposal distributions directly from noisy SPC data, avoiding the need for iterative refinement or gradient-based solvers.

Method: Train conditional flow-matching models on SPC control sequences collected in simulation, then use these models to bootstrap and amortize sampling-based MPC for more efficient online planning.

Result: The method improves sample efficiency, reduces planning horizon requirements, and generalizes robustly across task variations in both simulation and real-world hardware experiments with a quadruped robot.

Conclusion: Generative predictive control with conditional flow-matching models provides an effective approach for efficient and robust control in contact-rich loco-manipulation tasks, demonstrating practical real-world applicability.

Abstract: We present a generative predictive control (GPC) framework that amortizes
sampling-based Model Predictive Control (SPC) by bootstrapping it with
conditional flow-matching models trained on SPC control sequences collected in

solvers, we show that meaningful proposal distributions can be learned directly
from noisy SPC data, enabling more efficient and informed sampling during
online planning. We further demonstrate, for the first time, the application of
this approach to real-world contact-rich loco-manipulation with a quadruped
robot. Extensive experiments in simulation and on hardware show that our method
improves sample efficiency, reduces planning horizon requirements, and
generalizes robustly across task variations.

TL;DR: SaTA introduces a spatially-anchored tactile representation framework that grounds tactile features to hand kinematics, enabling sub-millimeter precision in dexterous manipulation tasks without requiring object models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visuo-tactile learning methods struggle with sub-millimeter precision tasks that are routine for model-based approaches, failing to effectively leverage both tactile richness and spatial relationships with hand kinematics.

Method: SaTA anchors tactile features to the hand's kinematic frame through forward kinematics, creating spatially grounded representations that enable precise geometric reasoning without object models or explicit pose estimation.

Result: SaTA significantly outperforms visuo-tactile baselines, improving success rates by up to 30% and reducing task completion times by 27% on challenging tasks like bimanual USB-C mating, light bulb installation, and card sliding.

Conclusion: Spatially grounded tactile representations enable learning-based methods to achieve sub-millimeter precision in dexterous manipulation, bridging the gap between learning and model-based approaches for high-precision tasks.

Abstract: Dexterous manipulation requires precise geometric reasoning, yet existing
visuo-tactile learning methods struggle with sub-millimeter precision tasks
that are routine for traditional model-based approaches. We identify a key
limitation: while tactile sensors provide rich contact information, current
learning frameworks fail to effectively leverage both the perceptual richness
of tactile signals and their spatial relationship with hand kinematics. We
believe an ideal tactile representation should explicitly ground contact
measurements in a stable reference frame while preserving detailed sensory
information, enabling policies to not only detect contact occurrence but also
precisely infer object geometry in the hand's coordinate system. We introduce
SaTA (Spatially-anchored Tactile Awareness for dexterous manipulation), an
end-to-end policy framework that explicitly anchors tactile features to the
hand's kinematic frame through forward kinematics, enabling accurate geometric
reasoning without requiring object models or explicit pose estimation. Our key
insight is that spatially grounded tactile representations allow policies to
not only detect contact occurrence but also precisely infer object geometry in
the hand's coordinate system. We validate SaTA on challenging dexterous
manipulation tasks, including bimanual USB-C mating in free space, a task
demanding sub-millimeter alignment precision, as well as light bulb
installation requiring precise thread engagement and rotational control, and
card sliding that demands delicate force modulation and angular precision.
These tasks represent significant challenges for learning-based methods due to
their stringent precision requirements. Across multiple benchmarks, SaTA
significantly outperforms strong visuo-tactile baselines, improving success
rates by up to 30 percentage while reducing task completion times by 27
percentage.

TL;DR: Integrating SMART learned traffic agents into nuPlan reveals that IDM-based simulation overestimates planner performance, while SMART agents provide more realistic evaluation showing planners perform better in complex interactions but degrade abruptly in edge cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rule-based traffic agents like IDM are simplistic and passive, hiding planner deficiencies and biasing rankings. They cannot react to adjacent lane vehicles, limiting tests of complex interaction capabilities.

Method: Integrated state-of-the-art learned traffic agent model SMART into nuPlan simulation framework to evaluate 14 recent planners and established baselines under more realistic conditions.

Result: IDM-based simulation overestimates planning performance - nearly all scores deteriorate with SMART agents. Many planners interact better than assumed and improve in multi-lane scenarios. Learned planners perform best but degrade abruptly in edge cases, while rule-based planners maintain basic behavior.

Conclusion: SMART-reactive simulation should be the new standard closed-loop benchmark in nuPlan, as it provides more realistic evaluation that narrows the sim-to-real gap and reveals true planner capabilities and limitations.

Abstract: Planner evaluation in closed-loop simulation often uses rule-based traffic
agents, whose simplistic and passive behavior can hide planner deficiencies and
bias rankings. Widely used IDM agents simply follow a lead vehicle and cannot
react to vehicles in adjacent lanes, hindering tests of complex interaction
capabilities. We address this issue by integrating the state-of-the-art learned
traffic agent model SMART into nuPlan. Thus, we are the first to evaluate
planners under more realistic conditions and quantify how conclusions shift
when narrowing the sim-to-real gap. Our analysis covers 14 recent planners and
established baselines and shows that IDM-based simulation overestimates
planning performance: nearly all scores deteriorate. In contrast, many planners
interact better than previously assumed and even improve in multi-lane,
interaction-heavy scenarios like lane changes or turns. Methods trained in
closed-loop demonstrate the best and most stable driving performance. However,
when reaching their limits in augmented edge-case scenarios, all learned
planners degrade abruptly, whereas rule-based planners maintain reasonable
basic behavior. Based on our results, we suggest SMART-reactive simulation as a
new standard closed-loop benchmark in nuPlan and release the SMART agents as a
drop-in alternative to IDM at https://github.com/shgd95/InteractiveClosedLoop.

TL;DR: CADRE is a reinforcement learning framework that uses Neural Descriptor Fields to extract contact features for catching falling objects and resetting manipulation systems, improving training efficiency and enabling zero-shot generalization to unseen objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world dexterous manipulation often encounters unexpected errors and disturbances that can cause catastrophic failures like dropping objects. The paper addresses the challenge of catching falling objects while they remain within grasping range and resetting the system to resume primary manipulation tasks.

Method: Proposed Contact-Aware Dynamic Recovery (CADRE) framework that incorporates a Neural Descriptor Field (NDF)-inspired module to extract implicit contact features, enabling direct reasoning about finger-object correspondence and adaptation to different object geometries.

Result: Experiments show that incorporating contact features improves training efficiency, enhances convergence performance for RL training, and leads to more successful recoveries. CADRE can generalize zero-shot to unseen objects with different geometries.

Conclusion: The CADRE framework effectively addresses dexterous manipulation recovery by leveraging contact-aware features through NDFs, demonstrating improved performance and generalization capabilities compared to methods relying solely on object pose or point cloud inputs.

Abstract: Real-world dexterous manipulation often encounters unexpected errors and
disturbances, which can lead to catastrophic failures, such as dropping the
manipulated object. To address this challenge, we focus on the problem of
catching a falling object while it remains within grasping range and,
importantly, resetting the system to a configuration favorable for resuming the
primary manipulation task. We propose Contact-Aware Dynamic Recovery (CADRE), a
reinforcement learning framework that incorporates a Neural Descriptor Field
(NDF)-inspired module to extract implicit contact features. Compared to methods
that rely solely on object pose or point cloud input, NDFs can directly reason
about finger-object correspondence and adapt to different object geometries.
Our experiments show that incorporating contact features improves training
efficiency, enhances convergence performance for RL training, and ultimately
leads to more successful recoveries. Additionally, we demonstrate that CADRE
can generalize zero-shot to unseen objects with different geometries.

Conclusion: Open TeleDex establishes a foundational, high-quality, and publicly available platform for accelerating both academic research and industry development in complex robotic manipulation and Imitation Learning.

Abstract: Accurate and high-fidelity demonstration data acquisition is a critical
bottleneck for deploying robot Imitation Learning (IL) systems, particularly
when dealing with heterogeneous robotic platforms. Existing teleoperation
systems often fail to guarantee high-precision data collection across diverse

unified teleoperation framework engineered for demonstration data collection.
Open TeleDex specifically tackles the TripleAny challenge, seamlessly
supporting any robotic arm, any dexterous hand, and any external input device.
Furthermore, we propose a novel hand pose retargeting algorithm that
significantly boosts the interoperability of Open TeleDex, enabling robust and
accurate compatibility with an even wider spectrum of heterogeneous master and
slave equipment. Open TeleDex establishes a foundational, high-quality, and
publicly available platform for accelerating both academic research and

*Aderik Verraest,Stavrow Bahnam,Robin Ferede,Guido de Croon,Christophe De Wagter*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SkyDreamer is the first end-to-end vision-based autonomous drone racing policy that maps pixels to motor commands, achieving champion-level performance with full sim-to-real transfer and onboard execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous drone racing systems are highly specific to racing and lack broader applicability. No existing system simultaneously achieves full sim-to-real transfer, onboard execution, and champion-level performance using end-to-end vision-based methods.

Method: SkyDreamer builds on informed Dreamer, a model-based reinforcement learning approach where the world model decodes to privileged information only available during training. The world model functions as an implicit state and parameter estimator, improving interpretability.

Result: SkyDreamer achieves robust, high-speed flight with speeds up to 21 m/s and accelerations up to 6 g, executing complex maneuvers like inverted loops, split-S, and ladder. It demonstrates non-trivial visual sim-to-real transfer, operates on poor-quality segmentation masks, and exhibits robustness to battery depletion by estimating motor RPM limits.

Conclusion: SkyDreamer brings robustness while achieving extremely high-speed, agile flight, highlighting its adaptability to important aspects of the reality gap in autonomous drone racing.

Abstract: Autonomous drone racing (ADR) systems have recently achieved champion-level
performance, yet remain highly specific to drone racing. While end-to-end
vision-based methods promise broader applicability, no system to date
simultaneously achieves full sim-to-real transfer, onboard execution, and
champion-level performance. In this work, we present SkyDreamer, to the best of
our knowledge, the first end-to-end vision-based ADR policy that maps directly
from pixel-level representations to motor commands. SkyDreamer builds on
informed Dreamer, a model-based reinforcement learning approach where the world
model decodes to privileged information only available during training. By
extending this concept to end-to-end vision-based ADR, the world model
effectively functions as an implicit state and parameter estimator, greatly
improving interpretability. SkyDreamer runs fully onboard without external aid,
resolves visual ambiguities by tracking progress using the state decoded from
the world model's hidden state, and requires no extrinsic camera calibration,
enabling rapid deployment across different drones without retraining.
Real-world experiments show that SkyDreamer achieves robust, high-speed flight,
executing tight maneuvers such as an inverted loop, a split-S and a ladder,
reaching speeds of up to 21 m/s and accelerations of up to 6 g. It further
demonstrates a non-trivial visual sim-to-real transfer by operating on
poor-quality segmentation masks, and exhibits robustness to battery depletion
by accurately estimating the maximum attainable motor RPM and adjusting its
flight path in real-time. These results highlight SkyDreamer's adaptability to
important aspects of the reality gap, bringing robustness while still achieving
extremely high-speed, agile flight.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes a continuous spatio-temporal Maps of Dynamics representation using implicit neural functions to model human motion patterns, eliminating discretization needs and enabling smooth generalization across space and time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safe and efficient robot operation in human environments requires good models of site-specific motion patterns, but existing Maps of Dynamics representations use discrete spatial sampling and require costly offline construction.

Method: Uses implicit neural functions that directly map coordinates to parameters of a Semi-Wrapped Gaussian Mixture Model, removing the need for discretization and imputation for unevenly sampled regions.

Result: Achieves better accuracy of motion representation and smoother velocity distributions in sparse regions while remaining computationally efficient, outperforming available baselines on a large public dataset with real-world people tracking data.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates a powerful and efficient way of modeling complex human motion patterns for improved robot operation in human environments.

Abstract: Safe and efficient robot operation in complex human environments can benefit
from good models of site-specific motion patterns. Maps of Dynamics (MoDs)
provide such models by encoding statistical motion patterns in a map, but
existing representations use discrete spatial sampling and typically require
costly offline construction. We propose a continuous spatio-temporal MoD
representation based on implicit neural functions that directly map coordinates
to the parameters of a Semi-Wrapped Gaussian Mixture Model. This removes the
need for discretization and imputation for unevenly sampled regions, enabling
smooth generalization across both space and time. Evaluated on a large public
dataset with long-term real-world people tracking data, our method achieves
better accuracy of motion representation and smoother velocity distributions in
sparse regions while still being computationally efficient, compared to
available baselines. The proposed approach demonstrates a powerful and
efficient way of modeling complex human motion patterns.

*Kun Lei,Huanyu Li,Dongjie Yu,Zhenyu Wei,Lingxiao Guo,Zhennan Jiang,Ziyu Wang,Shiyu Liang,Huazhe Xu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RL-100 is a real-world reinforcement learning framework using diffusion visuomotor policies that achieves 100% success rate across 900 trials on diverse robotic manipulation tasks, combining imitation learning, offline RL, and online RL with consistency distillation for low-latency control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world robotic manipulation requires reliability, efficiency, and robustness that approach or surpass skilled human operators, demanding a framework that can handle diverse tasks and environments.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: 1) Imitation learning for human priors, 2) Iterative offline RL with OPE-gated PPO updates in denoising process, 3) Online RL to eliminate failure modes. Includes consistency distillation for single-step policy with reduced latency.

Result: Achieved 100% success rate across 900 episodes on 7 diverse tasks including rigid-body control, fluid/granular pouring, cloth folding, dexterous unscrewing, and multi-stage juicing. Demonstrated up to 250 consecutive successful trials and 2-hour uninterrupted operation with near-human or better time efficiency.

Conclusion: RL-100 provides a task-, embodiment-, and representation-agnostic framework that achieves unprecedented reliability and robustness in real-world robotic manipulation, approaching or surpassing human-level performance across diverse manipulation domains.

Abstract: Real-world robotic manipulation in homes and factories demands reliability,
efficiency, and robustness that approach or surpass skilled human operators. We
present RL-100, a real-world reinforcement learning training framework built on
diffusion visuomotor policies trained bu supervised learning. RL-100 introduces
a three-stage pipeline. First, imitation learning leverages human priors.
Second, iterative offline reinforcement learning uses an Offline Policy
Evaluation procedure, abbreviated OPE, to gate PPO-style updates that are
applied in the denoising process for conservative and reliable improvement.
Third, online reinforcement learning eliminates residual failure modes. An
additional lightweight consistency distillation head compresses the multi-step
sampling process in diffusion into a single-step policy, enabling
high-frequency control with an order-of-magnitude reduction in latency while
preserving task performance. The framework is task-, embodiment-, and
representation-agnostic and supports both 3D point clouds and 2D RGB inputs, a
variety of robot platforms, and both single-step and action-chunk policies. We
evaluate RL-100 on seven real-robot tasks spanning dynamic rigid-body control,
such as Push-T and Agile Bowling, fluids and granular pouring, deformable cloth
folding, precise dexterous unscrewing, and multi-stage orange juicing. RL-100
attains 100\% success across evaluated trials for a total of 900 out of 900
episodes, including up to 250 out of 250 consecutive trials on one task. The
method achieves near-human teleoperation or better time efficiency and
demonstrates multi-hour robustness with uninterrupted operation lasting up to
two hours.

TL;DR: Multi-agent switching mode control strategy for acoustic-based target localization in single and multi-source scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sound-based sensors enable target localization without direct line of sight, which is crucial in critical conditions.

Method: Multi-agent switching mode control strategy with rigid formation for single source and independent search for multi-source scenarios.

Result: Proposed control strategy enables effective acoustic-based target localization in both single and multi-source environments.

Conclusion: The switching mode control approach provides a flexible solution for acoustic source seeking in different scenarios.

Abstract: Source seeking is an important topic in robotic research, especially
considering sound-based sensors since they allow the agents to locate a target
even in critical conditions where it is not possible to establish a direct line
of sight. In this work, we design a multi- agent switching mode control
strategy for acoustic-based target localization. Two scenarios are considered:
single source localization, in which the agents are driven maintaining a rigid
formation towards the target, and multi-source scenario, in which each agent
searches for the targets independently from the others.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Sadcher is a real-time task assignment framework for heterogeneous multi-robot teams that uses Imitation Learning with graph attention and transformers to predict assignment rewards, enabling dynamic coalition formation with task precedence constraints and scalability to larger problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of real-time task assignment for heterogeneous multi-robot teams that requires dynamic coalition formation while handling task precedence constraints and ensuring feasibility guarantees.

Method: Uses Imitation Learning trained on optimal schedules, combining graph attention and transformers to predict robot-task assignment rewards. Includes a relaxed bipartite matching step for scheduling with feasibility guarantees, explicitly modeling positions, durations, and processing times.

Result: Outperforms other learning-based and heuristic baselines on randomized unseen problems for small and medium teams, with computation times suitable for real-time operation. Successfully scales to larger task sets and team sizes than trained on.

Conclusion: Sadcher provides an effective real-time task assignment solution for heterogeneous multi-robot teams that generalizes well to different spatiotemporal distributions and scales effectively while maintaining feasibility guarantees.

Abstract: We present Sadcher, a real-time task assignment framework for heterogeneous
multi-robot teams that incorporates dynamic coalition formation and task
precedence constraints. Sadcher is trained through Imitation Learning and
combines graph attention and transformers to predict assignment rewards between
robots and tasks. Based on the predicted rewards, a relaxed bipartite matching
step generates high-quality schedules with feasibility guarantees. We
explicitly model robot and task positions, task durations, and robots'
remaining processing times, enabling advanced temporal and spatial reasoning
and generalization to environments with different spatiotemporal distributions
compared to training. Trained on optimally solved small-scale instances, our
method can scale to larger task sets and team sizes. Sadcher outperforms other
learning-based and heuristic baselines on randomized, unseen problems for small
and medium-sized teams with computation times suitable for real-time operation.
We also explore sampling-based variants and evaluate scalability across robot
and task counts. In addition, we release our dataset of 250,000 optimal

*Helene J. Levy,Brett T. Lopez*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: STITCHER is an optimization-free planning framework that stitches short trajectory segments using graph search to compute long-range, expressive, and near-optimal trajectories in real-time for autonomous high-speed navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimization-based planners face limitations in safety-critical scenarios due to computation time constraints and numerical instability risks, creating a need for real-time planning alternatives.

Method: The framework stitches short trajectory segments together with graph search, using innovative planning architecture and algorithmic developments to enable real-time planning without numerical optimization.

Result: Simulation tests show safe trajectories can be created within milliseconds for 50m x 50m environments, and hardware tests verify real-time trackable paths that respect nonconvex constraints like tilt angle and motor force limits.

Conclusion: STITCHER outperforms optimization-based planners by providing real-time trajectory planning that handles complex constraints while avoiding numerical instability issues.

Abstract: Autonomous high-speed navigation through large, complex environments requires
real-time generation of agile trajectories that are dynamically feasible,
collision-free, and satisfy state or actuator constraints. Modern trajectory
planning techniques primarily use numerical optimization, as they enable the
systematic computation of high-quality, expressive trajectories that satisfy
various constraints. However, stringent requirements on computation time and
the risk of numerical instability can limit the use of optimization-based
planners in safety-critical scenarios. This work presents an optimization-free
planning framework called STITCHER that stitches short trajectory segments
together with graph search to compute long-range, expressive, and near-optimal
trajectories in real-time. STITCHER outperforms modern optimization-based
planners through our innovative planning architecture and several algorithmic
developments that make real-time planning possible. Extensive simulation
testing is performed to analyze the algorithmic components that make up
STITCHER, along with a thorough comparison with two state-of-the-art
optimization planners. Simulation tests show that safe trajectories can be
created within a few milliseconds for paths that span the entirety of two 50 m
x 50 m environments. Hardware tests with a custom quadrotor verify that
STITCHER can produce trackable paths in real-time while respecting nonconvex
constraints, such as limits on tilt angle and motor forces, which are otherwise
hard to include in optimization-based planners.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VLA^2 is a novel agentic framework that enhances vision-language-action models by integrating external modules like web retrieval and object detection to handle out-of-distribution objects, achieving significant performance improvements on hard-level generalization benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models struggle with object concepts outside their training data, leading to significant performance drops when encountering unseen object descriptions and textures.

Method: Proposes VLA^2 framework that uses OpenVLA as execution backbone and integrates external modules (web retrieval, object detection) to provide visual and textual knowledge about target objects to the VLA model.

Result: Achieves 44.2% improvement in success rate on hard-level benchmark and 20.2% average improvement across all customized environments compared to standalone OpenVLA baseline, with no performance degradation on in-domain tasks.

Conclusion: The VLA^2 framework effectively mitigates generalization failure for out-of-distribution objects by leveraging external knowledge sources, demonstrating superior performance on challenging generalization benchmarks.

Abstract: Current vision-language-action (VLA) models, pre-trained on large-scale
robotic data, exhibit strong multi-task capabilities and generalize well to
variations in visual and language instructions for manipulation. However, their
success rate drops significantly when faced with object concepts outside the
training data, such as unseen object descriptions and textures in the dataset.
To address this, we propose a novel agentic framework, VLA^2, which leverages
OpenVLA as the execution backbone and effectively leverages external modules
such as web retrieval and object detection to provide visual and textual
knowledge about target objects to the VLA. This approach mitigates
generalization failure when handling out-of-distribution objects. Based on the
LIBERO simulation environment, we introduced novel objects and object
descriptions to construct a new evaluation benchmark with three difficulty
levels to test the effectiveness of our method. Our framework successfully
outperformed the current state-of-the-art models on our designed hard-level
generalization benchmark. Compared to the standalone OpenVLA baseline, VLA^2
achieves a 44.2% improvement in the success rate in the hard-level benchmark
and an average improvement of 20.2% in all customized environments without any
performance degradation on in-domain tasks. Project website:

TL;DR: VT-Refine is a visuo-tactile policy learning framework that combines real-world demonstrations, tactile simulation, and reinforcement learning for precise bimanual assembly tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans excel at bimanual assembly using tactile feedback, but robots struggle due to suboptimal human demonstrations and limited diversity in behavioral cloning approaches.

Method: Train diffusion policy on small real-world demonstrations with visual+tactile inputs, transfer to simulated digital twin with tactile sensors, refine via large-scale reinforcement learning using high-resolution piezoresistive tactile sensors modeled in GPU-accelerated simulation.

Result: VT-Refine improves assembly performance in both simulation and real world by increasing data diversity and enabling more effective policy fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The framework successfully combines real demonstrations, high-fidelity tactile simulation, and RL to achieve robust and generalized bimanual assembly capabilities.

Abstract: Humans excel at bimanual assembly tasks by adapting to rich tactile feedback
-- a capability that remains difficult to replicate in robots through
behavioral cloning alone, due to the suboptimality and limited diversity of
human demonstrations. In this work, we present VT-Refine, a visuo-tactile
policy learning framework that combines real-world demonstrations,
high-fidelity tactile simulation, and reinforcement learning to tackle precise,
contact-rich bimanual assembly. We begin by training a diffusion policy on a
small set of demonstrations using synchronized visual and tactile inputs. This
policy is then transferred to a simulated digital twin equipped with simulated
tactile sensors and further refined via large-scale reinforcement learning to
enhance robustness and generalization. To enable accurate sim-to-real transfer,
we leverage high-resolution piezoresistive tactile sensors that provide normal
force signals and can be realistically modeled in parallel using
GPU-accelerated simulation. Experimental results show that VT-Refine improves
assembly performance in both simulation and the real world by increasing data
diversity and enabling more effective policy fine-tuning. Our project page is

TL;DR: Layered control architecture with high-rate proprioceptive stabilizer and low-rate perceptual policy outperforms monolithic designs for robust humanoid locomotion in unstructured environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for robust humanoid locomotion in unstructured environments that balances fast low-level stabilization with slower perceptual decision-making.

Method: Two-stage training curriculum: blind stabilizer pretraining followed by perceptual fine-tuning, using simple layered control architecture with separate timescales.

Result: Layered policies consistently outperform one-stage alternatives in simulation and hardware, succeeding on stair and ledge tasks where one-stage policies fail.

Conclusion: Architectural separation of timescales, not network scale or complexity, is the key enabler for robust perception-conditioned locomotion.

Abstract: Robust humanoid locomotion in unstructured environments requires
architectures that balance fast low-level stabilization with slower perceptual
decision-making. We show that a simple layered control architecture (LCA), a
proprioceptive stabilizer running at high rate, coupled with a compact low-rate
perceptual policy, enables substantially more robust performance than
monolithic end-to-end designs, even when using minimal perception encoders.
Through a two-stage training curriculum (blind stabilizer pretraining followed
by perceptual fine-tuning), we demonstrate that layered policies consistently
outperform one-stage alternatives in both simulation and hardware. On a Unitree
G1 humanoid, our approach succeeds across stair and ledge tasks where one-stage
perceptual policies fail. These results highlight that architectural separation
of timescales, rather than network scale or complexity, is the key enabler for
robust perception-conditioned locomotion.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoboGhost is a retargeting-free framework that directly conditions humanoid policies on language-grounded motion latents, bypassing traditional multi-stage pipelines to enable fast, reactive control with semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing language-guided humanoid locomotion pipelines are cumbersome, unreliable, and prone to cumulative errors due to their multi-stage process (motion decoding, retargeting, physics-based tracking), which introduces high latency and weak coupling between semantics and control.

Method: Uses a diffusion-based policy that denoises executable actions directly from noise, preserving semantic intent. Incorporates a hybrid causal transformer-diffusion motion generator to ensure long-horizon consistency while maintaining stability and diversity.

Result: Substantially reduces deployment latency, improves success rates and tracking accuracy, and produces smooth, semantically aligned locomotion on real humanoids. Framework naturally extends to other modalities like images, audio, and music.

Conclusion: RoboGhost provides a more direct pathway from language to action, eliminating fragile intermediate stages and serving as a general foundation for vision-language-action humanoid systems.

Abstract: Natural language offers a natural interface for humanoid robots, but existing
language-guided humanoid locomotion pipelines remain cumbersome and unreliable.
They typically decode human motion, retarget it to robot morphology, and then
track it with a physics-based controller. However, this multi-stage process is
prone to cumulative errors, introduces high latency, and yields weak coupling
between semantics and control. These limitations call for a more direct pathway
from language to action, one that eliminates fragile intermediate stages.
Therefore, we present RoboGhost, a retargeting-free framework that directly
conditions humanoid policies on language-grounded motion latents. By bypassing
explicit motion decoding and retargeting, RoboGhost enables a diffusion-based
policy to denoise executable actions directly from noise, preserving semantic
intent and supporting fast, reactive control. A hybrid causal
transformer-diffusion motion generator further ensures long-horizon consistency
while maintaining stability and diversity, yielding rich latent representations
for precise humanoid behavior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboGhost
substantially reduces deployment latency, improves success rates and tracking
accuracy, and produces smooth, semantically aligned locomotion on real
humanoids. Beyond text, the framework naturally extends to other modalities
such as images, audio, and music, providing a general foundation for
vision-language-action humanoid systems.

### [190] [CBF-RL: Safety Filtering Reinforcement Learning in Training with Control Barrier Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14959)
*Lizhi Yang,Blake Werner,Massimiliano de Sa Aaron D. Ames*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CBF-RL is a framework that integrates Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) into reinforcement learning training to generate safe behaviors without needing online safety filters during deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL prioritizes performance over safety, which can lead to catastrophic outcomes in real-world applications. While CBFs provide safety guarantees online, they can cause conservative behaviors since RL policies don't understand the safety constraints.

Method: CBF-RL modifies nominal RL policies by adding CBF terms to encode safety constraints and applies safety filtering during policy rollouts in training. The framework proves that continuous-time safety filters can be deployed on discrete-time rollouts via closed-form expressions.

Result: CBF-RL internalizes safety constraints in learned policies, enabling safer actions and reward biasing. Experiments show safer exploration, faster convergence, and robust performance on navigation tasks and Unitree G1 humanoid robot, allowing obstacle avoidance and stair climbing without runtime safety filters.

Conclusion: CBF-RL successfully bridges the gap between RL performance and safety by embedding CBF constraints directly into training, eliminating the need for online safety filters while maintaining safety guarantees in real-world deployments.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), while powerful and expressive, can often
prioritize performance at the expense of safety. Yet safety violations can lead
to catastrophic outcomes in real-world deployments. Control Barrier Functions
(CBFs) offer a principled method to enforce dynamic safety -- traditionally
deployed \emph{online} via safety filters. While the result is safe behavior,
the fact that the RL policy does not have knowledge of the CBF can lead to
conservative behaviors. This paper proposes CBF-RL, a framework for generating
safe behaviors with RL by enforcing CBFs \emph{in training}. CBF-RL has two key
attributes: (1) minimally modifying a nominal RL policy to encode safety
constraints via a CBF term, (2) and safety filtering of the policy rollouts in
training. Theoretically, we prove that continuous-time safety filters can be
deployed via closed-form expressions on discrete-time roll-outs. Practically,
we demonstrate that CBF-RL internalizes the safety constraints in the learned
policy -- both enforcing safer actions and biasing towards safer rewards --
enabling safe deployment without the need for an online safety filter. We
validate our framework through ablation studies on navigation tasks and on the
Unitree G1 humanoid robot, where CBF-RL enables safer exploration, faster
convergence, and robust performance under uncertainty, enabling the humanoid
robot to avoid obstacles and climb stairs safely in real-world settings without
a runtime safety filter.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes Retrieval-based Demonstration Decomposer (RDD) to automatically decompose complex manipulation tasks into sub-tasks by aligning visual features with low-level policy training data, improving task performance over heuristic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM-based planners require human-annotated or heuristic sub-task decomposition, which can deviate from visuomotor policy training data and degrade performance.

Method: Uses visual feature alignment to automatically decompose demonstrations into sub-tasks that match the training data distribution of low-level visuomotor policies.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art sub-task decomposer on both simulation and real-world tasks, demonstrating robustness across diverse settings.

Conclusion: RDD provides an effective automatic decomposition method that aligns better with low-level policy capabilities, improving hierarchical VLA framework performance.

Abstract: To tackle long-horizon tasks, recent hierarchical vision-language-action
(VLAs) frameworks employ vision-language model (VLM)-based planners to
decompose complex manipulation tasks into simpler sub-tasks that low-level
visuomotor policies can easily handle. Typically, the VLM planner is finetuned
to learn to decompose a target task. This finetuning requires target task
demonstrations segmented into sub-tasks by either human annotation or heuristic
rules. However, the heuristic subtasks can deviate significantly from the
training data of the visuomotor policy, which degrades task performance. To
address these issues, we propose a Retrieval-based Demonstration Decomposer
(RDD) that automatically decomposes demonstrations into sub-tasks by aligning
the visual features of the decomposed sub-task intervals with those from the
training data of the low-level visuomotor policies. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art sub-task decomposer on both simulation and real-world tasks,
demonstrating robustness across diverse settings. Code and more results are
