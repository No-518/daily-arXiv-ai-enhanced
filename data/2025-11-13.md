Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a Generative AI solution for automating the digitization of SNAM's gas plant infrastructure using OCR, Vision LLM, Object Detection, and a novel Transformer architecture for relational reasoning, achieving 91% accuracy in design data extraction and 93% component identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate the digitization of gas plant infrastructure by extracting information from P&ID documents, streamlining daily work for MGM users and overcoming challenges from lack of standardization in plant documentation.

Method: Uses OCR, Vision LLM, Object Detection, Relational Reasoning and optimization algorithms on P&ID PDFs. Extends state-of-the-art Scene Graph Generation with a new Transformer architecture to analyze complex relations between plant components.

Result: Achieved 91% accuracy in textual design data extraction, 93% accuracy in component identification, and approximately 80% accuracy in hierarchical structure extraction.

Conclusion: The synergistic use of AI technologies successfully automated plant digitization, overcoming data variety challenges and achieving high accuracy rates for both design data and plant topology extraction.

Abstract: The energy transition is a key theme of the last decades to determine a future of eco-sustainability, and an area of such importance cannot disregard digitization, innovation and the new technological tools available. This is the context in which the Generative Artificial Intelligence models described in this paper are positioned, developed by Engineering Ingegneria Informatica SpA in order to automate the plant structures acquisition of SNAM energy infrastructure, a leading gas transportation company in Italy and Europe. The digitization of a gas plant consists in registering all its relevant information through the interpretation of the related documentation. The aim of this work is therefore to design an effective solution based on Artificial Intelligence techniques to automate the extraction of the information necessary for the digitization of a plant, in order to streamline the daily work of MGM users. The solution received the P&ID of the plant as input, each one in pdf format, and uses OCR, Vision LLM, Object Detection, Relational Reasoning and optimization algorithms to return an output consisting of two sets of information: a structured overview of the relevant design data and the hierarchical framework of the plant. To achieve convincing results, we extend a state-of-the-art model for Scene Graph Generation introducing a brand new Transformer architecture with the aim of deepening the analysis of the complex relations between the plant's components. The synergistic use of the listed AI-based technologies allowed to overcome many obstacles arising from the high variety of data, due to the lack of standardization. An accuracy of 91\% has been achieved in the extraction of textual information relating to design data. Regarding the plants topology, 93\% of components are correctly identified and the hierarchical structure is extracted with an accuracy around 80\%.

### [2] [Assessing Identity Leakage in Talking Face Generation: Metrics and Evaluation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08613)
*Dogucan Yaman,Fevziye Irem Eyiokur,Hazım Kemal Ekenel,Alexander Waibel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a systematic evaluation methodology to detect and quantify lip leakage in talking face generation models, using three test setups and derived metrics to establish a more reliable benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current inpainting-based talking face generation methods can introduce lip leaking where generated lips are influenced by identity reference images rather than driving audio, which is difficult to detect with standard metrics and conventional test setups.

Method: Develops a framework with three complementary test setups: silent-input generation, mismatched audio-video pairing, and matched audio-video synthesis, along with derived metrics including lip-sync discrepancy and silent-audio-based lip-sync scores. Also studies how different identity reference selections affect leakage.

Result: The proposed methodology is model-agnostic and provides a systematic way to analyze and quantify lip leakage in talking face generation systems.

Conclusion: Establishes a more reliable benchmark for future research in talking face generation by addressing the lip leakage problem through systematic evaluation methodology.

Abstract: Inpainting-based talking face generation aims to preserve video details such as pose, lighting, and gestures while modifying only lip motion, often using an identity reference image to maintain speaker consistency. However, this mechanism can introduce lip leaking, where generated lips are influenced by the reference image rather than solely by the driving audio. Such leakage is difficult to detect with standard metrics and conventional test setup. To address this, we propose a systematic evaluation methodology to analyze and quantify lip leakage. Our framework employs three complementary test setups: silent-input generation, mismatched audio-video pairing, and matched audio-video synthesis. We also introduce derived metrics including lip-sync discrepancy and silent-audio-based lip-sync scores. In addition, we study how different identity reference selections affect leakage, providing insights into reference design. The proposed methodology is model-agnostic and establishes a more reliable benchmark for future research in talking face generation.

### [3] [A Multi-Drone Multi-View Dataset and Deep Learning Framework for Pedestrian Detection and Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08615)
*Kosta Dakic,Kanchana Thilakarathna,Rodrigo N. Calheiros,Teng Joon Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MATRIX introduces a multi-drone surveillance dataset with dynamic camera positions and a deep learning framework for robust pedestrian tracking in complex environments with occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-drone surveillance approaches struggle with dynamic camera positions and complex occlusions, limiting their effectiveness in real-world urban environments.

Method: Proposes a deep learning framework with real-time camera calibration, feature-based image registration, and multi-view feature fusion in bird's-eye-view representation for dynamic drone-based surveillance.

Result: Achieves ~90% detection and tracking accuracy, successfully tracks ~80% of trajectories under challenging conditions, and shows strong generalization through transfer learning with graceful performance degradation during camera failures.

Conclusion: The MATRIX dataset and framework provide essential benchmarks for advancing dynamic multi-view surveillance systems, demonstrating robust performance in complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-drone surveillance systems offer enhanced coverage and robustness for pedestrian tracking, yet existing approaches struggle with dynamic camera positions and complex occlusions. This paper introduces MATRIX (Multi-Aerial TRacking In compleX environments), a comprehensive dataset featuring synchronized footage from eight drones with continuously changing positions, and a novel deep learning framework for multi-view detection and tracking. Unlike existing datasets that rely on static cameras or limited drone coverage, MATRIX provides a challenging scenario with 40 pedestrians and a significant architectural obstruction in an urban environment. Our framework addresses the unique challenges of dynamic drone-based surveillance through real-time camera calibration, feature-based image registration, and multi-view feature fusion in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Experimental results demonstrate that while static camera methods maintain over 90\% detection and tracking precision and accuracy metrics in a simplified MATRIX environment without an obstruction, 10 pedestrians and a much smaller observational area, their performance significantly degrades in the complex environment. Our proposed approach maintains robust performance with $\sim$90\% detection and tracking accuracy, as well as successfully tracks $\sim$80\% of trajectories under challenging conditions. Transfer learning experiments reveal strong generalization capabilities, with the pretrained model achieving much higher detection and tracking accuracy performance compared to training the model from scratch. Additionally, systematic camera dropout experiments reveal graceful performance degradation, demonstrating practical robustness for real-world deployments where camera failures may occur. The MATRIX dataset and framework provide essential benchmarks for advancing dynamic multi-view surveillance systems.

### [4] [Learning Topology-Driven Multi-Subspace Fusion for Grassmannian Deep Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08628)
*Xuan Yu,Tianyang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A topology-driven multi-subspace fusion framework on Grassmannian manifold that enables adaptive subspace collaboration through dynamic subspace selection and Fréchet mean optimization, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Grassmannian approaches rely on static single-subspace representations, neglecting the dynamic interplay between multiple subspaces critical for capturing complex geometric structures.

Method: Proposes adaptive multi-subspace modeling with dynamic subspace selection via topological convergence analysis, and multi-subspace interaction blocks using Fréchet mean optimization on the manifold, with Riemannian batch normalization and mutual information regularization.

Result: Extensive experiments on 3D action recognition (HDM05, FPHA), EEG classification (MAMEM-SSVEPII), and graph tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with superior discriminability and interpretability.

Conclusion: The work advances geometric deep learning by successfully adapting multi-channel interaction philosophy from Euclidean networks to non-Euclidean domains, establishing theoretical convergence guarantees and practical enhancements for robust subspace collaboration.

Abstract: Grassmannian manifold offers a powerful carrier for geometric representation learning by modelling high-dimensional data as low-dimensional subspaces. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on static single-subspace representations, neglecting the dynamic interplay between multiple subspaces critical for capturing complex geometric structures. To address this limitation, we propose a topology-driven multi-subspace fusion framework that enables adaptive subspace collaboration on the Grassmannian. Our solution introduces two key innovations: (1) Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, an adaptive multi-subspace modelling mechanism is proposed that dynamically selects and weights task-relevant subspaces via topological convergence analysis, and (2) a multi-subspace interaction block that fuses heterogeneous geometric representations through Fréchet mean optimisation on the manifold. Theoretically, we establish the convergence guarantees of adaptive subspaces under a projection metric topology, ensuring stable gradient-based optimisation. Practically, we integrate Riemannian batch normalisation and mutual information regularisation to enhance discriminability and robustness. Extensive experiments on 3D action recognition (HDM05, FPHA), EEG classification (MAMEM-SSVEPII), and graph tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Our work not only advances geometric deep learning but also successfully adapts the proven multi-channel interaction philosophy of Euclidean networks to non-Euclidean domains, achieving superior discriminability and interpretability.

### [5] [Time-to-Move: Training-Free Motion Controlled Video Generation via Dual-Clock Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08633)
*Assaf Singer,Noam Rotstein,Amir Mann,Ron Kimmel,Or Litany*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TTM is a training-free framework for motion- and appearance-controlled video generation using I2V diffusion models, leveraging crude reference animations as motion cues without requiring model fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based video generation lacks precise motion control, and prior methods require expensive model-specific fine-tuning, limiting flexibility and accessibility.

Method: Uses crude reference animations from user-friendly manipulations (cut-and-drag, depth-based reprojection) as coarse motion cues, adapts SDEdit mechanism to video domain, employs dual-clock denoising for region-dependent motion alignment while preserving appearance through image conditioning.

Result: TTM matches or exceeds training-based baselines in realism and motion control on object and camera motion benchmarks, while enabling precise appearance control through pixel-level conditioning beyond text-only prompting.

Conclusion: TTM provides a plug-and-play, training-free solution for motion- and appearance-controlled video generation that balances user intent fidelity with natural dynamics, compatible with any backbone model without additional computational costs.

Abstract: Diffusion-based video generation can create realistic videos, yet existing image- and text-based conditioning fails to offer precise motion control. Prior methods for motion-conditioned synthesis typically require model-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and restrictive. We introduce Time-to-Move (TTM), a training-free, plug-and-play framework for motion- and appearance-controlled video generation with image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models. Our key insight is to use crude reference animations obtained through user-friendly manipulations such as cut-and-drag or depth-based reprojection. Motivated by SDEdit's use of coarse layout cues for image editing, we treat the crude animations as coarse motion cues and adapt the mechanism to the video domain. We preserve appearance with image conditioning and introduce dual-clock denoising, a region-dependent strategy that enforces strong alignment in motion-specified regions while allowing flexibility elsewhere, balancing fidelity to user intent with natural dynamics. This lightweight modification of the sampling process incurs no additional training or runtime cost and is compatible with any backbone. Extensive experiments on object and camera motion benchmarks show that TTM matches or exceeds existing training-based baselines in realism and motion control. Beyond this, TTM introduces a unique capability: precise appearance control through pixel-level conditioning, exceeding the limits of text-only prompting.

### [6] [CADIC: Continual Anomaly Detection Based on Incremental Coreset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08634)
*Gen Yang,Zhipeng Deng,Junfeng Man*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a unified memory bank framework for continual anomaly detection that eliminates task-specific memory fragmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing continual anomaly detection methods require constructing class-specific sub-memory banks for each task, which limits flexibility and scalability.

Method: Incrementally updates embeddings within a fixed-size coreset using a unified memory bank shared across all tasks, with anomaly detection via nearest-neighbor matching.

Result: Achieves average AUROC scores of 0.972 on MVTec AD and 0.891 on Visa datasets, with 100% accuracy on a real-world electronic paper dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses memory fragmentation in continual anomaly detection while maintaining high detection accuracy and practical robustness.

Abstract: The primary objective of Continual Anomaly Detection (CAD) is to learn the normal patterns of new tasks under dynamic data distribution assumptions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Existing embedding-based CAD approaches continuously update a memory bank with new embeddings to adapt to sequential tasks. However, these methods require constructing class-specific sub-memory banks for each task, which restricts their flexibility and scalability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CAD framework where all tasks share a unified memory bank. During training, the method incrementally updates embeddings within a fixed-size coreset, enabling continuous knowledge acquisition from sequential tasks without task-specific memory fragmentation. In the inference phase, anomaly scores are computed via a nearest-neighbor matching mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art detection accuracy. We validate the method through comprehensive experiments on MVTec AD and Visa datasets. Results show that our approach outperforms existing baselines, achieving average image-level AUROC scores of 0.972 (MVTec AD) and 0.891 (Visa). Notably, on a real-world electronic paper dataset, it demonstrates 100% accuracy in anomaly sample detection, confirming its robustness in practical scenarios. The implementation will be open-sourced on GitHub.

### [7] [Predict and Resist: Long-Term Accident Anticipation under Sensor Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08640)
*Xingcheng Liu,Bin Rao,Yanchen Guan,Chengyue Wang,Haicheng Liao,Jiaxun Zhang,Chengyu Lin,Meixin Zhu,Zhenning Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified framework combining diffusion-based denoising with time-aware actor-critic modeling for robust accident anticipation in autonomous driving, addressing sensor noise and prediction timing challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address two key challenges in real-world accident anticipation: noisy/degraded sensory inputs from weather, motion blur, or hardware limitations, and the need for timely yet reliable predictions that balance early alerts with false-alarm suppression.

Method: Integrates diffusion-based denoising with time-aware actor-critic model. Diffusion module reconstructs noise-resilient image and object features through iterative refinement. Actor-critic architecture uses long-horizon temporal reasoning and time-weighted rewards to determine optimal alert timing.

Result: State-of-the-art accuracy on three benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) with significant gains in mean time-to-accident. Maintains robust performance under Gaussian and impulse noise. Produces earlier, more stable, human-aligned predictions in both routine and complex traffic scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates potential for real-world, safety-critical deployment by providing robust accident anticipation under challenging sensory conditions while balancing early detection with reliability.

Abstract: Accident anticipation is essential for proactive and safe autonomous driving, where even a brief advance warning can enable critical evasive actions. However, two key challenges hinder real-world deployment: (1) noisy or degraded sensory inputs from weather, motion blur, or hardware limitations, and (2) the need to issue timely yet reliable predictions that balance early alerts with false-alarm suppression. We propose a unified framework that integrates diffusion-based denoising with a time-aware actor-critic model to address these challenges. The diffusion module reconstructs noise-resilient image and object features through iterative refinement, preserving critical motion and interaction cues under sensor degradation. In parallel, the actor-critic architecture leverages long-horizon temporal reasoning and time-weighted rewards to determine the optimal moment to raise an alert, aligning early detection with reliability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and significant gains in mean time-to-accident, while maintaining robust performance under Gaussian and impulse noise. Qualitative analyses further show that our model produces earlier, more stable, and human-aligned predictions in both routine and highly complex traffic scenarios, highlighting its potential for real-world, safety-critical deployment.

### [8] [RS-Net: Context-Aware Relation Scoring for Dynamic Scene Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08651)
*Hae-Won Jo,Yeong-Jun Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RS-Net is a modular framework for Dynamic Scene Graph Generation that scores object pair relations using spatial interactions and temporal context, improving relation prediction without architectural changes to existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DSGG methods lack guidance for non-related object pairs, making it difficult to identify meaningful relations during inference due to training only on annotated pairs.

Method: Proposes Relation Scoring Network (RS-Net) with spatial context encoder using learnable context tokens and temporal encoder for video-level information aggregation, integrated into unified triplet scoring mechanism.

Result: Experiments on Action Genome dataset show consistent improvements in Recall and Precision across baselines, with notable gains in mean Recall, addressing long-tailed relation distribution while maintaining competitive efficiency.

Conclusion: RS-Net effectively enhances relation prediction in DSGG by scoring contextual importance of object pairs, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods with easy integration into existing models.

Abstract: Dynamic Scene Graph Generation (DSGG) models how object relations evolve over time in videos. However, existing methods are trained only on annotated object pairs and lack guidance for non-related pairs, making it difficult to identify meaningful relations during inference. In this paper, we propose Relation Scoring Network (RS-Net), a modular framework that scores the contextual importance of object pairs using both spatial interactions and long-range temporal context. RS-Net consists of a spatial context encoder with learnable context tokens and a temporal encoder that aggregates video-level information. The resulting relation scores are integrated into a unified triplet scoring mechanism to enhance relation prediction. RS-Net can be easily integrated into existing DSGG models without architectural changes. Experiments on the Action Genome dataset show that RS-Net consistently improves both Recall and Precision across diverse baselines, with notable gains in mean Recall, highlighting its ability to address the long-tailed distribution of relations. Despite the increased number of parameters, RS-Net maintains competitive efficiency, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

### [9] [Privacy Beyond Pixels: Latent Anonymization for Privacy-Preserving Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08666)
*Joseph Fioresi,Ishan Rajendrakumar Dave,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel visual privacy preservation method for video foundation models that operates in latent space using a lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) to remove private information while maintaining task utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current privacy methods focus on pixel-level anonymization, requiring full model retraining and creating task-specific solutions unsuitable for video foundation models. Extracted video features inadvertently reveal sensitive personal information like skin color, gender, or clothing.

Method: Lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) applied to frozen video encoders with three training objectives: clip-level self-supervised privacy objective, co-training objective for utility retention, and latent consistency loss for generalization.

Result: 35% reduction in privacy leakage while maintaining near-baseline utility across Action Recognition (Kinetics400, UCF101, HMDB51), Temporal Action Detection (THUMOS14), and Anomaly Detection (UCF-Crime). Effectively mitigates gender bias in action recognition.

Conclusion: The proposed AAM framework provides effective privacy preservation for video foundation models through latent space manipulation, enabling plug-and-play anonymization without retraining while maintaining utility and reducing biases.

Abstract: We introduce a novel formulation of visual privacy preservation for video foundation models that operates entirely in the latent space. While spatio-temporal features learned by foundation models have deepened general understanding of video content, sharing or storing these extracted visual features for downstream tasks inadvertently reveals sensitive personal information like skin color, gender, or clothing. Current privacy preservation methods focus on input-pixel-level anonymization, which requires retraining the entire utility video model and results in task-specific anonymization, making them unsuitable for recent video foundational models. To address these challenges, we introduce a lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) that removes private information from video features while retaining general task utility. AAM can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion to frozen video encoders, minimizing the computational burden of finetuning and re-extracting features. Our framework employs three newly designed training objectives: (1) a clip-level self-supervised privacy objective to reduce mutual information between static clips, (2) a co-training objective to retain utility across seen tasks, and (3) a latent consistency loss for generalization on unseen tasks. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a significant 35% reduction in privacy leakage while maintaining near-baseline utility performance across various downstream tasks: Action Recognition (Kinetics400, UCF101, HMDB51), Temporal Action Detection (THUMOS14), and Anomaly Detection (UCF-Crime). We also provide an analysis on anonymization for sensitive temporal attribute recognition. Additionally, we propose new protocols for assessing gender bias in action recognition models, showing that our method effectively mitigates such biases and promotes more equitable video understanding.

### [10] [Rethinking generative image pretraining: How far are we from scaling up next-pixel prediction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08704)
*Xinchen Yan,Chen Liang,Lijun Yu,Adams Wei Yu,Yifeng Lu,Quoc V. Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores scaling properties of autoregressive next-pixel prediction for unified vision models, finding that optimal scaling strategies differ significantly between classification and generation tasks, and that compute rather than data is the primary bottleneck for future scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the scaling properties of autoregressive next-pixel prediction as a simple, end-to-end framework for unified vision models, and understand how scaling strategies differ across tasks and resolutions.

Method: Trained a family of Transformers using IsoFlops profiles across compute budgets up to 7e19 FLOPs at resolutions starting from 32x32, evaluating three metrics: next-pixel prediction objective, ImageNet classification accuracy, and generation quality measured by Fréchet Distance.

Result: Found that optimal scaling strategy is task-dependent - generation requires data size to grow 3-5x faster than classification. As resolution increases, model size must grow much faster than data size. The primary bottleneck is compute rather than training data.

Conclusion: Based on current compute growth trends (4-5x annually), pixel-by-pixel modeling of images is forecasted to be feasible within the next five years, with compute being the main limiting factor rather than data availability.

Abstract: This paper investigates the scaling properties of autoregressive next-pixel prediction, a simple, end-to-end yet under-explored framework for unified vision models. Starting with images at resolutions of 32x32, we train a family of Transformers using IsoFlops profiles across compute budgets up to 7e19 FLOPs and evaluate three distinct target metrics: next-pixel prediction objective, ImageNet classification accuracy, and generation quality measured by Fr'echet Distance. First, optimal scaling strategy is critically task-dependent. At a fixed 32x32 resolution alone, the optimal scaling properties for image classification and image generation diverge, where generation optimal setup requires the data size grow three to five times faster than for the classification optimal setup. Second, as image resolution increases, the optimal scaling strategy indicates that the model size must grow much faster than data size. Surprisingly, by projecting our findings, we discover that the primary bottleneck is compute rather than the amount of training data. As compute continues to grow four to five times annually, we forecast the feasibility of pixel-by-pixel modeling of images within the next five years.

### [11] [Harnessing Diffusion-Generated Synthetic Images for Fair Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08711)
*Abhipsa Basu,Aviral Gupta,Abhijnya Bhat,R. Venkatesh Babu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using diffusion model finetuning techniques (LoRA and DreamBooth) to generate balanced training data for debiasing image classification systems, addressing issues where vanilla Stable Diffusion struggles to preserve original data distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image classification systems inherit biases from uneven group representation in training data, such as blond hair being disproportionately associated with females in face datasets, which reinforces stereotypes. Existing approaches using Stable Diffusion for balanced data generation often fail to preserve original data distributions.

Method: Multiple diffusion-finetuning techniques including LoRA and DreamBooth are explored. To handle excessive intra-group variations, images within each group are clustered and a DreamBooth model is trained per cluster. These models generate group-balanced data for pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data.

Result: Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the studied finetuning approaches outperform vanilla Stable Diffusion on average and achieve results comparable to state-of-the-art debiasing techniques like Group-DRO, while surpassing them as dataset bias severity increases.

Conclusion: Diffusion model finetuning techniques effectively generate balanced training data for debiasing image classification systems, with performance improving relative to existing methods as dataset bias becomes more severe.

Abstract: Image classification systems often inherit biases from uneven group representation in training data. For example, in face datasets for hair color classification, blond hair may be disproportionately associated with females, reinforcing stereotypes. A recent approach leverages the Stable Diffusion model to generate balanced training data, but these models often struggle to preserve the original data distribution. In this work, we explore multiple diffusion-finetuning techniques, e.g., LoRA and DreamBooth, to generate images that more accurately represent each training group by learning directly from their samples. Additionally, in order to prevent a single DreamBooth model from being overwhelmed by excessive intra-group variations, we explore a technique of clustering images within each group and train a DreamBooth model per cluster. These models are then used to generate group-balanced data for pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the studied finetuning approaches outperform vanilla Stable Diffusion on average and achieve results comparable to SOTA debiasing techniques like Group-DRO, while surpassing them as the dataset bias severity increases.

### [13] [Adaptive graph Kolmogorov-Arnold network for 3D human pose estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08809)
*Abu Taib Mohammed Shahjahan,A. Ben Hamza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoseKAN is an adaptive graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Network framework for 2D-to-3D human pose estimation that addresses limitations of GCNs by using learnable activation functions and multi-hop feature aggregation to capture long-range dependencies and high-frequency details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GCN-based methods for 3D pose estimation have limited receptive fields that struggle with long-range dependencies needed for handling occlusions and depth ambiguities, and exhibit spectral bias that prioritizes low-frequency components over high-frequency details.

Method: Extends KANs to graph-based learning with learnable functions on graph edges, employs multi-hop feature aggregation for local and distant neighbor information, uses residual PoseKAN blocks for deeper feature refinement, and incorporates global response normalization for improved feature selectivity.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: PoseKAN provides an effective framework that enhances adaptability and expressiveness for 3D human pose estimation by addressing key limitations of traditional GCN approaches.

Abstract: Graph convolutional network (GCN)-based methods have shown strong performance in 3D human pose estimation by leveraging the natural graph structure of the human skeleton. However, their local receptive field limits their ability to capture long-range dependencies essential for handling occlusions and depth ambiguities. They also exhibit spectral bias, which prioritizes low-frequency components while struggling to model high-frequency details. In this paper, we introduce PoseKAN, an adaptive graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), framework that extends KANs to graph-based learning for 2D-to-3D pose lifting from a single image. Unlike GCNs that use fixed activation functions, KANs employ learnable functions on graph edges, allowing data-driven, adaptive feature transformations. This enhances the model's adaptability and expressiveness, making it more expressive in learning complex pose variations. Our model employs multi-hop feature aggregation, ensuring the body joints can leverage information from both local and distant neighbors, leading to improved spatial awareness. It also incorporates residual PoseKAN blocks for deeper feature refinement, and a global response normalization for improved feature selectivity and contrast. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our model against state-of-the-art methods.

*Jingjie He,Weijie Liang,Zihan Shan,Matthew Caesar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIFT-Graph is a multimodal defense framework that combines SIFT keypoints with Graph Attention Networks to create robust feature embeddings, which are fused with traditional vision models to improve adversarial robustness against white-box attacks with minimal impact on clean accuracy.


<details>

Motivation: Deep vision models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks due to their reliance on fragile pixel-level representations. Traditional defenses operate in the same vulnerable pixel domain without incorporating inherently robust visual features.

Method: Integrates Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) keypoints with Graph Attention Network to capture scale and rotation invariant local structures. These robust feature embeddings are fused with traditional vision models like Vision Transformers and CNNs.

Result: Effectively improves visual model robustness against gradient-based white-box adversarial attacks while maintaining only marginal drop in clean accuracy.

Conclusion: The SIFT-Graph framework provides a unified, structure-aware defense mechanism that enhances adversarial robustness by leveraging multimodal feature aggregation from both handcrafted and learned modalities.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks expose a fundamental vulnerability in modern deep vision models by exploiting their dependence on dense, pixel-level representations that are highly sensitive to imperceptible perturbations. Traditional defense strategies typically operate within this fragile pixel domain, lacking mechanisms to incorporate inherently robust visual features. In this work, we introduce SIFT-Graph, a multimodal defense framework that enhances the robustness of traditional vision models by aggregating structurally meaningful features extracted from raw images using both handcrafted and learned modalities. Specifically, we integrate Scale-Invariant Feature Transform keypoints with a Graph Attention Network to capture scale and rotation invariant local structures that are resilient to perturbations. These robust feature embeddings are then fused with traditional vision model, such as Vision Transformer and Convolutional Neural Network, to form a unified, structure-aware and perturbation defensive model. Preliminary results demonstrate that our method effectively improves the visual model robustness against gradient-based white box adversarial attacks, while incurring only a marginal drop in clean accuracy.

### [15] [DT-NVS: Diffusion Transformers for Novel View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08823)
*Wonbong Jang,Jonathan Tremblay,Lourdes Agapito*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DT-NVS is a 3D diffusion model for generalized novel view synthesis from single images, using transformer architecture and novel training strategies to handle real-world scenes from casually acquired videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on small camera movements or unnatural object-centric scenes, limiting real-world applications. The goal is to generate novel views of everyday scenes from single images.

Method: Proposes DT-NVS - a 3D-aware diffusion model with transformer backbone, novel camera conditioning strategies for unaligned datasets, and a training paradigm swapping reference frame roles between conditioning image and noisy input.

Result: Shows improvements over state-of-the-art 3D aware diffusion models and deterministic approaches in generalized novel view synthesis from single images, while generating diverse outputs.

Conclusion: The approach successfully moves beyond constrained regimes to handle real-world scenes, demonstrating effective novel view synthesis from single images using diffusion models trained on casually acquired video data.

Abstract: Generating novel views of a natural scene, e.g., every-day scenes both indoors and outdoors, from a single view is an under-explored problem, even though it is an organic extension to the object-centric novel view synthesis. Existing diffusion-based approaches focus rather on small camera movements in real scenes or only consider unnatural object-centric scenes, limiting their potential applications in real-world settings. In this paper we move away from these constrained regimes and propose a 3D diffusion model trained with image-only losses on a large-scale dataset of real-world, multi-category, unaligned, and casually acquired videos of everyday scenes. We propose DT-NVS, a 3D-aware diffusion model for generalized novel view synthesis that exploits a transformer-based architecture backbone. We make significant contributions to transformer and self-attention architectures to translate images to 3d representations, and novel camera conditioning strategies to allow training on real-world unaligned datasets. In addition, we introduce a novel training paradigm swapping the role of reference frame between the conditioning image and the sampled noisy input. We evaluate our approach on the 3D task of generalized novel view synthesis from a single input image and show improvements over state-of-the-art 3D aware diffusion models and deterministic approaches, while generating diverse outputs.

### [16] [Enhancing Rotation-Invariant 3D Learning with Global Pose Awareness and Attention Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08833)
*Jiaxun Guo,Manar Amayri,Nizar Bouguila,Xin Liu,Wentao Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Shadow-informed Pose Feature (SiPF) and Rotation-invariant Attention Convolution (RIAttnConv) to address the limitation of existing rotation-invariant 3D point cloud methods in distinguishing geometrically similar but spatially distinct structures due to loss of global pose information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing rotation-invariant methods for 3D point clouds lose global pose information, making them incapable of distinguishing geometrically similar but spatially distinct structures (e.g., left vs right airplane wings), which stems from restricted receptive fields and causes 'Wing-tip feature collapse'.

Method: Introduces Shadow-informed Pose Feature (SiPF) that augments local rotation-invariant descriptors with a globally consistent reference point ('shadow') from learned shared rotation, and Rotation-invariant Attention Convolution (RIAttnConv) that integrates SiPFs into feature aggregation. Also includes a task-adaptive shadow locating module based on Bingham distribution.

Result: Extensive experiments on 3D classification and part segmentation benchmarks show the approach substantially outperforms existing rotation-invariant methods, particularly in tasks requiring fine-grained spatial discrimination under arbitrary rotations.

Conclusion: The proposed SiPF and RIAttnConv framework effectively preserves global pose awareness while maintaining rotation invariance, successfully overcoming the limitations of existing methods in distinguishing symmetric components and achieving superior performance in rotation-invariant 3D point cloud analysis.

Abstract: Recent advances in rotation-invariant (RI) learning for 3D point clouds typically replace raw coordinates with handcrafted RI features to ensure robustness under arbitrary rotations. However, these approaches often suffer from the loss of global pose information, making them incapable of distinguishing geometrically similar but spatially distinct structures. We identify that this limitation stems from the restricted receptive field in existing RI methods, leading to Wing-tip feature collapse, a failure to differentiate symmetric components (e.g., left and right airplane wings) due to indistinguishable local geometries. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the Shadow-informed Pose Feature (SiPF), which augments local RI descriptors with a globally consistent reference point (referred to as the 'shadow') derived from a learned shared rotation. This mechanism enables the model to preserve global pose awareness while maintaining rotation invariance. We further propose Rotation-invariant Attention Convolution (RIAttnConv), an attention-based operator that integrates SiPFs into the feature aggregation process, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to distinguish structurally similar components. Additionally, we design a task-adaptive shadow locating module based on the Bingham distribution over unit quaternions, which dynamically learns the optimal global rotation for constructing consistent shadows. Extensive experiments on 3D classification and part segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms existing RI methods, particularly in tasks requiring fine-grained spatial discrimination under arbitrary rotations.

*Hu Cui,Wenqiang Hua,Renjing Huang,Shurui Jia,Tessai Hayama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAS-SSM introduces a structure-aware spatiotemporal convolution and stride-based scan strategy to address limitations of existing SSM-based methods in 3D human pose estimation, achieving competitive performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSM-based methods disrupt the inherent spatial structure of human poses and entangle spatial and temporal features by applying manually designed scan operations, making it difficult to capture complex pose dependencies.

Method: Proposes Skeleton Structure-Aware Stride SSM (SAS-SSM) with structure-aware spatiotemporal convolution for local joint interactions and stride-based scan strategy for multi-scale global structural representations.

Result: SasMamba model achieves competitive 3D pose estimation performance with significantly fewer parameters compared to existing hybrid models.

Conclusion: SAS-SSM enables flexible modeling of both local and global pose information while maintaining linear computational complexity, addressing limitations of existing SSM-based approaches.

Abstract: Recently, the Mamba architecture based on State Space Models (SSMs) has gained attention in 3D human pose estimation due to its linear complexity and strong global modeling capability. However, existing SSM-based methods typically apply manually designed scan operations to flatten detected 2D pose sequences into purely temporal sequences, either locally or globally. This approach disrupts the inherent spatial structure of human poses and entangles spatial and temporal features, making it difficult to capture complex pose dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose the Skeleton Structure-Aware Stride SSM (SAS-SSM), which first employs a structure-aware spatiotemporal convolution to dynamically capture essential local interactions between joints, and then applies a stride-based scan strategy to construct multi-scale global structural representations. This enables flexible modeling of both local and global pose information while maintaining linear computational complexity. Built upon SAS-SSM, our model SasMamba achieves competitive 3D pose estimation performance with significantly fewer parameters compared to existing hybrid models.

### [18] [Improve Contrastive Clustering Performance by Multiple Fusing-Augmenting ViT Blocks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08883)
*Cheng Wang,Shuisheng Zhou,Fengjiao Peng,Jin Sheng,Feng Ye,Yinli Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel multiple fusing-augmenting ViT blocks (MFAVBs) architecture for image clustering that explicitly fuses features from positive pairs through multiple fusion and augmentation operations, outperforming state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing contrastive learning networks with parameter sharing or momentum updating may not fully exploit the complementarity and similarity of positive pairs for clustering feature extraction.

Method: Design MFAVBs using Vision Transformers where positive pairs are processed through shared-weight ViTs, their features are fused and passed through larger ViTs, then split into new augmented pairs for multiple fusion-augmentation cycles. Features are projected to instance-level and clustering-level spaces with cross-entropy loss.

Result: Experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate that MFAVBs as backbone for contrastive clustering outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in clustering performance.

Conclusion: The proposed MFAVBs architecture effectively exploits feature complementarity through explicit fusion and multiple augmentation cycles, achieving superior clustering performance compared to existing contrastive learning approaches.

Abstract: In the field of image clustering, the widely used contrastive learning networks improve clustering performance by maximizing the similarity between positive pairs and the dissimilarity of negative pairs of the inputs. Extant contrastive learning networks, whose two encoders often implicitly interact with each other by parameter sharing or momentum updating, may not fully exploit the complementarity and similarity of the positive pairs to extract clustering features from input data. To explicitly fuse the learned features of positive pairs, we design a novel multiple fusing-augmenting ViT blocks (MFAVBs) based on the excellent feature learning ability of Vision Transformers (ViT). Firstly, two preprocessed augmentions as positive pairs are separately fed into two shared-weight ViTs, then their output features are fused to input into a larger ViT. Secondly, the learned features are split into a pair of new augmented positive samples and passed to the next FAVBs, enabling multiple fusion and augmention through MFAVBs operations. Finally, the learned features are projected into both instance-level and clustering-level spaces to calculate the cross-entropy loss, followed by parameter updates by backpropagation to finalize the training process. To further enhance ability of the model to distinguish between similar images, our input data for the network we propose is preprocessed augmentions with features extracted from the CLIP pretrained model. Our experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate that MFAVBs serving as the backbone for contrastive clustering outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in terms of clustering performance.

*Sanyukta Adap,Ujjwal Baid,Spyridon Bakas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a deep learning approach using EfficientNet architectures to classify six histopathological regions in glioblastoma (GBM) tissue sections, achieving high F1 scores on training data but lower performance on validation and testing data, highlighting generalization challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated identification of histological sub-regions in GBM could help understand the disease morphology at scale, as current histopathological assessment hasn't led to substantial improvements in patient prognosis despite being the primary diagnostic method.

Method: Four-step deep learning approach using EfficientNet architectures (B0-B4) to classify six histopathological regions in H&E stained GBM tissue sections from the BraTS-Path 2024 dataset, evaluated with 5-fold cross-validation.

Result: EfficientNet-B1 and B4 achieved F1 score of 0.98 on training data, but performance dropped to 0.546 on validation data and 0.517 on final testing data, showing significant generalization challenges.

Conclusion: While the approach shows promise for automated GBM histopathological analysis, the performance gap between training and testing data underscores the difficulty in developing models that generalize well to new data, which is critical for clinical applications.

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common aggressive, fast-growing brain tumor, with a grim prognosis. Despite clinical diagnostic advancements, there have not been any substantial improvements to patient prognosis. Histopathological assessment of excised tumors is the first line of clinical diagnostic routine. We hypothesize that automated, robust, and accurate identification of distinct histological sub-regions within GBM could contribute to morphologically understanding this disease at scale. In this study, we designed a four-step deep learning approach to classify six (6) histopathological regions and quantitatively evaluated it on the BraTS-Path 2024 challenge dataset, which includes digitized Hematoxylin \& Eosin (H\&E) stained GBM tissue sections annotated for six distinct regions. We used the challenge's publicly available training dataset to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of several variants of EfficientNet architectures (i.e., B0, B1, B2, B3, B4). EfficientNet-B1 and EfficientNet-B4 achieved the best performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.98 in a 5-fold cross-validation configuration using the BraTS-Path training set. The quantitative performance evaluation of our proposed approach with EfficientNet-B1 on the BraTS-Path hold-out validation data and the final hidden testing data yielded F1 scores of 0.546 and 0.517, respectively, for the associated 6-class classification task. The difference in the performance on training, validation, and testing data highlights the challenge of developing models that generalize well to new data, which is crucial for clinical applications.

By leveraging principles of Hebbian learning and temporal continuity associating temporally adjacent views to build invariant representations. VisNet and its extensions capture robust and transformation invariant features. Experimental results across multiple datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR10, and custom symmetric object sets, show that these enhanced VisNet variants substantially improve recognition accuracy compared with the baseline model. These findings underscore the adaptability and biological relevance of VisNet inspired architectures, offering a powerful and interpretable framework for visual recognition in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.

*Riling Wei,Kelu Yao,Chuanguang Yang,Jin Wang,Zhuoyan Gao,Chao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes SemBridge, a framework for Asymmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (ACKD) that enables knowledge transfer between modalities with limited semantic overlap, addressing the limitations of traditional symmetric approaches that require strongly paired data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (SCKD) requires strongly paired modalities with strong semantic connections, which is often unavailable in real-world scenarios. The authors aim to address this limitation by exploring knowledge distillation under weak semantic consistency conditions.

Method: The proposed SemBridge framework includes two key modules: 1) Student-Friendly Matching module that uses self-supervised learning to acquire semantic-based knowledge and provides personalized instruction by dynamically selecting relevant teacher samples, and 2) Semantic-aware Knowledge Alignment module that employs Lagrangian optimization to find optimal transport paths.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with 7 existing approaches on 6 different model architectures across various datasets, particularly on a curated benchmark dataset of Multi-Spectral and asymmetric RGB images for remote sensing scene classification.

Conclusion: The proposed ACKD approach and SemBridge framework effectively address the challenges of knowledge transfer between modalities with limited semantic overlap, providing a more flexible and practical solution for real-world applications where strongly paired data is scarce.

Abstract: Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation has demonstrated promising performance on paired modalities with strong semantic connections, referred to as Symmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (SCKD). However, implementing SCKD becomes exceedingly constrained in real-world scenarios due to the limited availability of paired modalities. To this end, we investigate a general and effective knowledge learning concept under weak semantic consistency, dubbed Asymmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (ACKD), aiming to bridge modalities with limited semantic overlap. Nevertheless, the shift from strong to weak semantic consistency improves flexibility but exacerbates challenges in knowledge transmission costs, which we rigorously verified based on optimal transport theory. To mitigate the issue, we further propose a framework, namely SemBridge, integrating a Student-Friendly Matching module and a Semantic-aware Knowledge Alignment module. The former leverages self-supervised learning to acquire semantic-based knowledge and provide personalized instruction for each student sample by dynamically selecting the relevant teacher samples. The latter seeks the optimal transport path by employing Lagrangian optimization. To facilitate the research, we curate a benchmark dataset derived from two modalities, namely Multi-Spectral (MS) and asymmetric RGB images, tailored for remote sensing scene classification. Comprehensive experiments exhibit that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with 7 existing approaches on 6 different model architectures across various datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework that enhances semi-supervised document layout detection by fusing visual predictions with structural priors from LLMs via probabilistic weighting, achieving strong performance with minimal labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Document layout understanding remains data-intensive despite advances in semi-supervised learning, requiring a method to leverage structural priors from LLMs to reduce labeling requirements.

Method: OCR-LLM pipeline infers hierarchical regions which are combined with teacher detector outputs through inverse-variance fusion to generate refined pseudo-labels with principled probabilistic weighting.

Result: Achieved 88.2±0.3 AP with 5% labels on PubLayNet using lightweight SwiftFormer, and 89.7±0.4 AP with LayoutLMv3, surpassing standard semi-supervised learning and matching UDOP which requires extensive pretraining.

Conclusion: LLM structural priors are complementary to both lightweight and pretrained architectures, enabling privacy-preserving deployment and targeted semantic disambiguation with reasonable computational costs.

Abstract: Document layout understanding remains data-intensive despite advances in semi-supervised learning. We present a framework that enhances semi-supervised detection by fusing visual predictions with structural priors from text-pretrained LLMs via principled probabilistic weighting. Given unlabeled documents, an OCR-LLM pipeline infers hierarchical regions which are combined with teacher detector outputs through inverse-variance fusion to generate refined pseudo-labels.Our method demonstrates consistent gains across model scales. With a lightweight SwiftFormer backbone (26M params), we achieve 88.2$\pm$0.3 AP using only 5\% labels on PubLayNet. When applied to document-pretrained LayoutLMv3 (133M params), our fusion framework reaches 89.7$\pm$0.4 AP, surpassing both LayoutLMv3 with standard semi-supervised learning (89.1$\pm$0.4 AP, p=0.02) and matching UDOP~\cite{udop} (89.8 AP) which requires 100M+ pages of multimodal pretraining. This demonstrates that LLM structural priors are complementary to both lightweight and pretrained architectures. Key findings include: (1) learned instance-adaptive gating improves over fixed weights by +0.9 AP with data-dependent PAC bounds correctly predicting convergence; (2) open-source LLMs enable privacy-preserving deployment with minimal loss (Llama-3-70B: 87.1 AP lightweight, 89.4 AP with LayoutLMv3); (3) LLMs provide targeted semantic disambiguation (18.7\% of cases, +3.8 AP gain) beyond simple text heuristics.Total system cost includes \$12 for GPT-4o-mini API or 17 GPU-hours for local Llama-3-70B per 50K pages, amortized across training runs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous unsupervised methods using generator networks for style transfer often lead to poor performance due to generator overfitting, which this work aims to solve.

Method: Introduces Consistency Change Detection Framework (CCDF) with two modules: Cycle Consistency (CC) to reduce generator overfitting and Semantic Consistency (SC) for detail reconstruction.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The CCDF framework effectively addresses generator overfitting issues in unsupervised remote sensing change detection through consistency modules, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Unsupervised remote sensing change detection aims to monitor and analyze changes from multi-temporal remote sensing images in the same geometric region at different times, without the need for labeled training data. Previous unsupervised methods attempt to achieve style transfer across multi-temporal remote sensing images through reconstruction by a generator network, and then capture the unreconstructable areas as the changed regions. However, it often leads to poor performance due to generator overfitting. In this paper, we propose a novel Consistency Change Detection Framework (CCDF) to address this challenge. Specifically, we introduce a Cycle Consistency (CC) module to reduce the overfitting issues in the generator-based reconstruction. Additionally, we propose a Semantic Consistency (SC) module to enable detail reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HitoMi-Cam is a lightweight, shape-agnostic person detection method using spectral reflectance properties of clothing, achieving 23.2 fps on edge devices and outperforming CNNs in scenarios with unpredictable postures like search and rescue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN-based object detection suffers from shape dependency that degrades performance for postures not in training data, limiting effectiveness in real-world scenarios like disaster rescue.

Method: Spectral-based approach using clothing reflectance properties, implemented on resource-constrained edge devices without GPU for practical evaluation.

Result: Achieved 23.2 fps processing speed and 93.5% average precision in search and rescue scenarios, significantly outperforming CNN models (best AP 53.8%) with minimal false positives.

Conclusion: HitoMi-Cam serves as a complementary tool to CNN-based detectors, proving spectral-based person detection is viable for real-time edge device operation in environments with unpredictable shapes.

Abstract: While convolutional neural network (CNN)-based object detection is widely used, it exhibits a shape dependency that degrades performance for postures not included in the training data. Building upon our previous simulation study published in this journal, this study implements and evaluates the spectral-based approach on physical hardware to address this limitation. Specifically, this paper introduces HitoMi-Cam, a lightweight and shape-agnostic person detection method that uses the spectral reflectance properties of clothing. The author implemented the system on a resource-constrained edge device without a GPU to assess its practical viability. The results indicate that a processing speed of 23.2 frames per second (fps) (253x190 pixels) is achievable, suggesting that the method can be used for real-time applications. In a simulated search and rescue scenario where the performance of CNNs declines, HitoMi-Cam achieved an average precision (AP) of 93.5%, surpassing that of the compared CNN models (best AP of 53.8%). Throughout all evaluation scenarios, the occurrence of false positives remained minimal. This study positions the HitoMi-Cam method not as a replacement for CNN-based detectors but as a complementary tool under specific conditions. The results indicate that spectral-based person detection can be a viable option for real-time operation on edge devices in real-world environments where shapes are unpredictable, such as disaster rescue.

*Zimao Lu,Hui Xu,Bing Liu,Ke Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NES (Negative Entity Suppression) is a novel method for zero-shot image captioning that addresses hallucination issues by identifying and suppressing negative entities - objects that appear in generated captions but are absent from input images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-only training for zero-shot image captioning suffers from poor cross-domain generalization and hallucination when encountering novel visual environments. Retrieval-based methods can exacerbate hallucination when retrieved captions contain irrelevant entities.

Method: NES integrates three stages: (1) uses synthetic images for consistent image-to-text retrieval across training/inference, (2) filters negative entities from retrieved content, and (3) applies attention-level suppression using identified negative entities to minimize hallucination-prone features.

Result: Evaluation across multiple benchmarks shows NES maintains competitive in-domain performance while improving cross-domain transfer and reducing hallucination rates, achieving new state-of-the-art results in zero-shot image captioning.

Conclusion: NES effectively addresses hallucination in zero-shot image captioning through negative entity suppression, demonstrating improved cross-domain generalization while maintaining strong in-domain performance.

Abstract: Text-only training provides an attractive approach to address data scarcity challenges in zero-shot image captioning (ZIC), avoiding the expense of collecting paired image-text annotations. However, although these approaches perform well within training domains, they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization, often producing hallucinated content when encountering novel visual environments. Retrieval-based methods attempt to mitigate this limitation by leveraging external knowledge, but they can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination when retrieved captions contain entities irrelevant to the inputs. We introduce the concept of negative entities--objects that appear in generated caption but are absent from the input--and propose Negative Entity Suppression (NES) to tackle this challenge. NES seamlessly integrates three stages: (1) it employs synthetic images to ensure consistent image-to-text retrieval across both training and inference; (2) it filters negative entities from retrieved content to enhance accuracy; and (3) it applies attention-level suppression using identified negative entities to further minimize the impact of hallucination-prone features. Evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that NES maintains competitive in-domain performance while improving cross-domain transfer and reducing hallucination rates, achieving new state-of-the-art results in ZIC.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPEED-Q is a novel framework for low-bit weight-only quantization of Vision-Language Models (1B-2B parameters) that addresses modality sensitivity discrepancies and training instability through staged processing and enhanced distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable deployment of VLMs on resource-constrained edge devices through aggressive quantization, as existing research rarely explores quantization for small-scale VLMs suitable for edge deployment.

Method: Proposes SPEED-Q with staged sensitivity adaptive mechanism to harmonize performance across vision and language components, and distillation-enhanced quantization strategy to stabilize training and reduce data dependence.

Result: Achieves up to 6x higher accuracy than existing methods under 2-bit settings and consistently outperforms prior on-device VLMs under both 2-bit and 4-bit settings across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: SPEED-Q enables accurate, stable, and data-efficient quantization of complex VLMs, making it the first framework tailored for quantizing entire small-scale billion-parameter VLMs to low bits.

Abstract: Deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on edge devices (e.g., smartphones and robots) is crucial for enabling low-latency and privacy-preserving intelligent applications. Given the resource constraints of these devices, quantization offers a promising solution by improving memory efficiency and reducing bandwidth requirements, thereby facilitating the deployment of VLMs. However, existing research has rarely explored aggressive quantization on VLMs, particularly for the models ranging from 1B to 2B parameters, which are more suitable for resource-constrained edge devices. In this paper, we propose SPEED-Q, a novel Staged Processing with Enhanced Distillation framework for VLM low-bit weight-only quantization that systematically addresses the following two critical obstacles: (1) significant discrepancies in quantization sensitivity between vision (ViT) and language (LLM) components in VLMs; (2) training instability arising from the reduced numerical precision inherent in low-bit quantization. In SPEED-Q, a staged sensitivity adaptive mechanism is introduced to effectively harmonize performance across different modalities. We further propose a distillation-enhanced quantization strategy to stabilize the training process and reduce data dependence. Together, SPEED-Q enables accurate, stable, and data-efficient quantization of complex VLMs. SPEED-Q is the first framework tailored for quantizing entire small-scale billion-parameter VLMs to low bits. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SPEED-Q achieves up to 6x higher accuracy than existing quantization methods under 2-bit settings and consistently outperforms prior on-device VLMs under both 2-bit and 4-bit settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diff-FCHM is a novel collaborative compression method that uses machine-vision-oriented compression as the basis for human vision, featuring a plug-and-play variable bit-rate strategy and diffusion prior to restore high-fidelity details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing collaborative compression methods built on human-vision pipelines show deficiencies in complexity and bit-rates when integrating machine-vision compression, since machine vision only needs core regions while human vision requires more compressed information.

Method: Proposes Diff-FCHM which uses machine-vision compression as the foundation, progressively aggregates semantics from machine-vision compression, and employs diffusion prior to restore high-fidelity details for human vision with a plug-and-play variable bit-rate strategy.

Result: Experimental results show consistently superior performance on both machine-vision and human-vision compression with remarkable margins compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Diff-FCHM successfully demonstrates that machine-vision-oriented compression can effectively serve as the basis for collaborative compression, achieving better performance for both human and machine vision tasks.

Abstract: Human-machine collaborative compression has been receiving increasing research efforts for reducing image/video data, serving as the basis for both human perception and machine intelligence. Existing collaborative methods are dominantly built upon the de facto human-vision compression pipeline, witnessing deficiency on complexity and bit-rates when aggregating the machine-vision compression. Indeed, machine vision solely focuses on the core regions within the image/video, requiring much less information compared with the compressed information for human vision. In this paper, we thus set out the first successful attempt by a novel collaborative compression method based on the machine-vision-oriented compression, instead of human-vision pipeline. In other words, machine vision serves as the basis for human vision within collaborative compression. A plug-and-play variable bit-rate strategy is also developed for machine vision tasks. Then, we propose to progressively aggregate the semantics from the machine-vision compression, whilst seamlessly tailing the diffusion prior to restore high-fidelity details for human vision, thus named as diffusion-prior based feature compression for human and machine visions (Diff-FCHM). Experimental results verify the consistently superior performances of our Diff-FCHM, on both machine-vision and human-vision compression with remarkable margins. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

*Hanbo Cheng,Peng Wang,Kaixiang Lei,Qi Li,Zhen Zou,Pengfei Hu,Jun Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Hierarchical Distillation (HD), a novel framework that synergistically combines trajectory-based and distribution-based distillation methods for diffusion models. By using trajectory distillation as a structural sketch and distribution-based methods for refinement, along with an Adaptive Weighted Discriminator (AWD), it achieves state-of-the-art single-step performance while maintaining high fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inference latency barrier in diffusion models by addressing the fundamental trade-off between trajectory-based methods (which preserve global structure but lose high-frequency details) and distribution-based methods (which achieve higher fidelity but suffer from mode collapse and unstable training).

Method: Proposes a Hierarchical Distillation (HD) framework that uses trajectory distillation as a structural sketch to provide near-optimal initialization, followed by distribution-based refinement. Introduces Adaptive Weighted Discriminator (AWD) that dynamically allocates token weights to focus on local imperfections for efficient detail refinement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance: single-step model on ImageNet 256×256 reaches FID of 2.26, rivaling its 250-step teacher. Also shows promising results on high-resolution text-to-image MJHQ benchmark, demonstrating generalizability.

Conclusion: The HD framework establishes a robust new paradigm for high-fidelity, single-step diffusion models by synergistically combining trajectory and distribution distillation methods, overcoming previous limitations and achieving competitive performance with significantly reduced inference steps.

Abstract: The inference latency of diffusion models remains a critical barrier to their real-time application. While trajectory-based and distribution-based step distillation methods offer solutions, they present a fundamental trade-off. Trajectory-based methods preserve global structure but act as a "lossy compressor", sacrificing high-frequency details. Conversely, distribution-based methods can achieve higher fidelity but often suffer from mode collapse and unstable training. This paper recasts them from independent paradigms into synergistic components within our novel Hierarchical Distillation (HD) framework. We leverage trajectory distillation not as a final generator, but to establish a structural ``sketch", providing a near-optimal initialization for the subsequent distribution-based refinement stage. This strategy yields an ideal initial distribution that enhances the ceiling of overall performance. To further improve quality, we introduce and refine the adversarial training process. We find standard discriminator structures are ineffective at refining an already high-quality generator. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Weighted Discriminator (AWD), tailored for the HD pipeline. By dynamically allocating token weights, AWD focuses on local imperfections, enabling efficient detail refinement. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks. On ImageNet $256\times256$, our single-step model achieves an FID of 2.26, rivaling its 250-step teacher. It also achieves promising results on the high-resolution text-to-image MJHQ benchmark, proving its generalizability. Our method establishes a robust new paradigm for high-fidelity, single-step diffusion models.

*Yipeng Zou,Qin Liu,Jie Wu,Yu Peng,Guo Chen,Hui Zhou,Guanghui Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NAMEA is a novel ensemble attack that integrates gradients from non-attention areas of heterogeneous models to improve adversarial transferability across different architectures like CNNs and ViTs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous ensemble attacks show unsatisfactory performance when transferring across heterogeneous model architectures due to widely differing gradient update directions, making it hard to reduce gradient variance while leveraging individual models effectively.

Method: NAMEA decouples gradients from attention and non-attention areas of ensemble models, then merges them using meta-learning. It specifically integrates gradients from non-attention areas since attention areas vary sharply across heterogeneous models.

Result: On ImageNet dataset, NAMEA outperforms state-of-the-art ensemble attacks AdaEA and SMER by an average of 15.0% and 9.6% respectively.

Conclusion: This is the first work to explore ensemble non-attention for boosting cross-architecture transferability, providing new insights into launching more effective ensemble attacks.

Abstract: Ensemble attacks integrate the outputs of surrogate models with diverse architectures, which can be combined with various gradient-based attacks to improve adversarial transferability. However, previous work shows unsatisfactory attack performance when transferring across heterogeneous model architectures. The main reason is that the gradient update directions of heterogeneous surrogate models differ widely, making it hard to reduce the gradient variance of ensemble models while making the best of individual model. To tackle this challenge, we design a novel ensemble attack, NAMEA, which for the first time integrates the gradients from the non-attention areas of ensemble models into the iterative gradient optimization process. Our design is inspired by the observation that the attention areas of heterogeneous models vary sharply, thus the non-attention areas of ViTs are likely to be the focus of CNNs and vice versa. Therefore, we merge the gradients respectively from the attention and non-attention areas of ensemble models so as to fuse the transfer information of CNNs and ViTs. Specifically, we pioneer a new way of decoupling the gradients of non-attention areas from those of attention areas, while merging gradients by meta-learning. Empirical evaluations on ImageNet dataset indicate that NAMEA outperforms AdaEA and SMER, the state-of-the-art ensemble attacks by an average of 15.0% and 9.6%, respectively. This work is the first attempt to explore the power of ensemble non-attention in boosting cross-architecture transferability, providing new insights into launching ensemble attacks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes BRHVC, a novel neural B-frame video compression method that harmonizes bi-directional references using Bi-directional Motion Converge (BMC) and Bi-directional Contextual Fusion (BCF) to address unbalanced reference frame contributions in hierarchical coding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural B-frame video compression (NBVC) remains underexplored compared to P-frame compression, and existing hierarchical coding approaches suffer from unbalanced contributions from bi-directional reference frames during temporal prediction, especially at large frame spans.

Method: BRHVC uses Bi-directional Motion Converge (BMC) to converge multiple optical flows for more accurate motion compensation, and Bi-directional Contextual Fusion (BCF) to explicitly model reference context weights guided by motion compensation accuracy.

Result: BRHVC outperforms previous state-of-the-art neural video compression methods and even surpasses traditional coding standard VTM-RA (random access configuration) on HEVC datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed BRHVC method effectively harmonizes bi-directional references through more efficient motion and context utilization, demonstrating superior compression performance for neural B-frame video coding.

Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) has made significant progress in recent years, while neural B-frame video compression (NBVC) remains underexplored compared to P-frame compression. NBVC can adopt bi-directional reference frames for better compression performance. However, NBVC's hierarchical coding may complicate continuous temporal prediction, especially at some hierarchical levels with a large frame span, which could cause the contribution of the two reference frames to be unbalanced. To optimize reference information utilization, we propose a novel NBVC method, termed Bi-directional Reference Harmonization Video Compression (BRHVC), with the proposed Bi-directional Motion Converge (BMC) and Bi-directional Contextual Fusion (BCF). BMC converges multiple optical flows in motion compression, leading to more accurate motion compensation on a larger scale. Then BCF explicitly models the weights of reference contexts under the guidance of motion compensation accuracy. With more efficient motions and contexts, BRHVC can effectively harmonize bi-directional references. Experimental results indicate that our BRHVC outperforms previous state-of-the-art NVC methods, even surpassing the traditional coding, VTM-RA (under random access configuration), on the HEVC datasets.

TL;DR: Proposes FGM-HD framework that uses Hausdorff Dimension to enhance diversity in Fractal Generative Models while maintaining image quality, achieving 39% diversity improvement on ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fractal Generative Models generate high-quality images but suffer from limited diversity due to inherent self-similarity, requiring methods to enhance output variety without compromising visual quality.

Method: Uses learnable HD estimation from image embeddings, HD-based loss with momentum-driven scheduling for training, and HD-guided rejection sampling during inference to select geometrically richer outputs.

Result: Achieves 39% improvement in output diversity compared to vanilla FGMs on ImageNet dataset while preserving comparable image quality.

Conclusion: First work to introduce Hausdorff Dimension into FGM, effectively enhancing diversity while providing theoretical contribution to FGM development.

Abstract: Improving the diversity of generated results while maintaining high visual quality remains a significant challenge in image generation tasks. Fractal Generative Models (FGMs) are efficient in generating high-quality images, but their inherent self-similarity limits the diversity of output images. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach based on the Hausdorff Dimension (HD), a widely recognized concept in fractal geometry used to quantify structural complexity, which aids in enhancing the diversity of generated outputs. To incorporate HD into FGM, we propose a learnable HD estimation method that predicts HD directly from image embeddings, addressing computational cost concerns. However, simply introducing HD into a hybrid loss is insufficient to enhance diversity in FGMs due to: 1) degradation of image quality, and 2) limited improvement in generation diversity. To this end, during training, we adopt an HD-based loss with a monotonic momentum-driven scheduling strategy to progressively optimize the hyperparameters, obtaining optimal diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Moreover, during inference, we employ HD-guided rejection sampling to select geometrically richer outputs. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our FGM-HD framework yields a 39\% improvement in output diversity compared to vanilla FGMs, while preserving comparable image quality. To our knowledge, this is the very first work introducing HD into FGM. Our method effectively enhances the diversity of generated outputs while offering a principled theoretical contribution to FGM development.

*RuiQiang Zhang,Zehua Ma,Guanjie Wang,Chang Liu,Hengyi Wang,Weiming Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AuthSig is a novel static electronic signature framework that uses generative models and watermarking to bind authentication information to signature images, enabling reliable verification and preventing malicious reuse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static scanned signatures are widely used but lack authentication attributes, making them vulnerable to copying and reuse. Current solutions like dynamic pressure-sensitive and PKI-based signatures are not universally adopted.

Method: AuthSig uses generative models to modulate style embeddings during signature generation, implicitly encoding watermark bits. It employs a keypoint-driven data augmentation strategy to enhance style diversity for robust watermark embedding.

Result: AuthSig achieves over 98% extraction accuracy under digital-domain distortions and signature-specific degradations, and remains effective in print-scan scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the authentication limitations of static signatures by embedding watermarks through style modulation, enabling reliable verification while maintaining signature convenience.

Abstract: With the deepening trend of paperless workflows, signatures as a means of identity authentication are gradually shifting from traditional ink-on-paper to electronic formats.Despite the availability of dynamic pressure-sensitive and PKI-based digital signatures, static scanned signatures remain prevalent in practice due to their convenience. However, these static images, having almost lost their authentication attributes, cannot be reliably verified and are vulnerable to malicious copying and reuse. To address these issues, we propose AuthSig, a novel static electronic signature framework based on generative models and watermark, which binds authentication information to the signature image. Leveraging the human visual system's insensitivity to subtle style variations, AuthSig finely modulates style embeddings during generation to implicitly encode watermark bits-enforcing a One Signature, One Use policy.To overcome the scarcity of handwritten signature data and the limitations of traditional augmentation methods, we introduce a keypoint-driven data augmentation strategy that effectively enhances style diversity to support robust watermark embedding. Experimental results show that AuthSig achieves over 98% extraction accuracy under both digital-domain distortions and signature-specific degradations, and remains effective even in print-scan scenarios.

TL;DR: Proposes CoDR, a coreset-based dual retrieval framework for efficient and effective demonstration selection in in-context learning for Large Visual Language Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional demonstration selection methods (random, similarity-based, infoscore-based) are inefficient or suboptimal, struggling to balance efficiency and effectiveness in the NP-hard demonstration selection problem.

Method: Uses cluster-pruning to construct diverse coresets with high expected mutual information, combined with a dual retrieval mechanism for global demonstration selection while maintaining efficiency.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvement in ICL performance compared to existing strategies.

Conclusion: CoDR provides a robust solution for effective and efficient demonstration selection in in-context learning.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs), enabling them to leverage a few examples directly from input contexts. However, the effectiveness of this approach is heavily reliant on the selection of demonstrations, a process that is NP-hard. Traditional strategies, including random, similarity-based sampling and infoscore-based sampling, often lead to inefficiencies or suboptimal performance, struggling to balance both efficiency and effectiveness in demonstration selection. In this paper, we propose a novel demonstration selection framework named Coreset-based Dual Retrieval (CoDR). We show that samples within a diverse subset achieve a higher expected mutual information. To implement this, we introduce a cluster-pruning method to construct a diverse coreset that aligns more effectively with the query while maintaining diversity. Additionally, we develop a dual retrieval mechanism that enhances the selection process by achieving global demonstration selection while preserving efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the ICL performance compared to the existing strategies, providing a robust solution for effective and efficient demonstration selection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WDT-MD is a Wavelet Diffusion Transformer framework that addresses limitations in diffusion-based microaneurysm detection by preventing identity mapping, distinguishing MAs from other anomalies, and improving normal feature reconstruction, achieving state-of-the-art performance on diabetic retinopathy screening.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based anomaly detection methods for microaneurysm screening suffer from identity mapping issues, inability to distinguish MAs from other anomalies, and poor reconstruction of normal features, limiting their clinical application.

Method: Proposes WDT-MD with three innovations: noise-encoded image conditioning to prevent identity mapping, pseudo-normal pattern synthesis via inpainting for pixel-level supervision, and wavelet diffusion Transformer architecture combining global modeling with multi-scale analysis.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on IDRiD and e-ophtha MA datasets in both pixel-level and image-level microaneurysm detection.

Conclusion: The WDT-MD framework significantly advances early diabetic retinopathy screening by overcoming key limitations of existing diffusion-based approaches.

Abstract: Microaneurysms (MAs), the earliest pathognomonic signs of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), present as sub-60 $μm$ lesions in fundus images with highly variable photometric and morphological characteristics, rendering manual screening not only labor-intensive but inherently error-prone. While diffusion-based anomaly detection has emerged as a promising approach for automated MA screening, its clinical application is hindered by three fundamental limitations. First, these models often fall prey to "identity mapping", where they inadvertently replicate the input image. Second, they struggle to distinguish MAs from other anomalies, leading to high false positives. Third, their suboptimal reconstruction of normal features hampers overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Wavelet Diffusion Transformer framework for MA Detection (WDT-MD), which features three key innovations: a noise-encoded image conditioning mechanism to avoid "identity mapping" by perturbing image conditions during training; pseudo-normal pattern synthesis via inpainting to introduce pixel-level supervision, enabling discrimination between MAs and other anomalies; and a wavelet diffusion Transformer architecture that combines the global modeling capability of diffusion Transformers with multi-scale wavelet analysis to enhance reconstruction of normal retinal features. Comprehensive experiments on the IDRiD and e-ophtha MA datasets demonstrate that WDT-MD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pixel-level and image-level MA detection. This advancement holds significant promise for improving early DR screening.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing segmentation methods degrade under heavy noise corruption and intensity inhomogeneity, particularly with Gamma-distributed multiplicative noise and Poisson noise.

Method: Integrates denoising terms (I-divergence + adaptive TV regularizer) with bias field estimation within ICTM framework, using spatially adaptive weights and characteristic functions for region representation, optimized via RMSAV scheme.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world images show superior accuracy and robustness compared to competing approaches for images with intensity inhomogeneity and diverse noise types.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively handles segmentation challenges in noisy images with intensity inhomogeneity, demonstrating improved performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a core task in image processing, yet many methods degrade when images are heavily corrupted by noise and exhibit intensity inhomogeneity. Within the iterative-convolution thresholding method (ICTM) framework, we propose a variational segmentation model that integrates denoising terms. Specifically, the denoising component consists of an I-divergence term and an adaptive total-variation (TV) regularizer, making the model well suited to images contaminated by Gamma--distributed multiplicative noise and Poisson noise. A spatially adaptive weight derived from a gray-level indicator guides diffusion differently across regions of varying intensity. To further address intensity inhomogeneity, we estimate a smoothly varying bias field, which improves segmentation accuracy. Regions are represented by characteristic functions, with contour length encoded accordingly. For efficient optimization, we couple ICTM with a relaxed modified scalar auxiliary variable (RMSAV) scheme. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world images with intensity inhomogeneity and diverse noise types show that the proposed model achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared with competing approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T-Rex-Omni introduces negative visual prompts to address limitations of positive-only open-set object detectors, using a unified encoder, training-free NNC module, and NNH loss to suppress distractors and improve zero-shot detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current open-set object detectors rely only on positive indicators (text or visual prompts), making them vulnerable to visually similar but semantically different distractors. The positive-only paradigm needs enhancement to handle hard negative cases.

Method: Proposes T-Rex-Omni framework with: 1) unified visual prompt encoder for positive/negative prompts, 2) training-free Negating Negative Computing (NNC) module to suppress negative responses, 3) Negating Negative Hinge (NNH) loss for discriminative margins between embeddings, supporting both positive-only and joint inference modes.

Result: Achieves remarkable zero-shot detection performance, significantly narrowing gap between visual-prompted and text-prompted methods, with strong performance in long-tailed scenarios (51.2 AP_r on LVIS-minival).

Conclusion: Negative prompts are established as a crucial new dimension for advancing open-set visual recognition systems, providing effective handling of hard negative distractors.

Abstract: Object detection methods have evolved from closed-set to open-set paradigms over the years. Current open-set object detectors, however, remain constrained by their exclusive reliance on positive indicators based on given prompts like text descriptions or visual exemplars. This positive-only paradigm experiences consistent vulnerability to visually similar but semantically different distractors. We propose T-Rex-Omni, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating negative visual prompts to negate hard negative distractors. Specifically, we first introduce a unified visual prompt encoder that jointly processes positive and negative visual prompts. Next, a training-free Negating Negative Computing (NNC) module is proposed to dynamically suppress negative responses during the probability computing stage. To further boost performance through fine-tuning, our Negating Negative Hinge (NNH) loss enforces discriminative margins between positive and negative embeddings. T-Rex-Omni supports flexible deployment in both positive-only and joint positive-negative inference modes, accommodating either user-specified or automatically generated negative examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate remarkable zero-shot detection performance, significantly narrowing the performance gap between visual-prompted and text-prompted methods while showing particular strength in long-tailed scenarios (51.2 AP_r on LVIS-minival). This work establishes negative prompts as a crucial new dimension for advancing open-set visual recognition systems.

TL;DR: Owl is a causally-grounded framework that addresses object hallucination in LVLMs by modeling the interaction between visual and textual attention, introducing VTACR metric to quantify modality imbalance, and implementing attention intervention with dual-path contrastive decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches independently regulate visual or textual attention, overlooking their interaction as key causal factors in object hallucination where models generate content inconsistent with visual inputs.

Method: Models hallucination process via structural causal graph, treats decomposed visual/textual attentions as mediators, introduces VTACR metric, implements fine-grained attention intervention mechanism, and uses dual-path contrastive decoding strategy.

Result: Achieves significant hallucination reduction on POPE and CHAIR benchmarks, setting new SOTA in faithfulness while preserving vision-language understanding capability.

Conclusion: Owl effectively mitigates object hallucination by addressing modality contribution imbalance through causally-grounded attention reweighting and contrastive decoding strategies.

Abstract: Object hallucination remains a critical challenge in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where models generate content inconsistent with visual inputs. Existing language-decoder based mitigation approaches often regulate visual or textual attention independently, overlooking their interaction as two key causal factors. To address this, we propose Owl (Bi-mOdal attention reWeighting for Layer-wise hallucination mitigation), a causally-grounded framework that models hallucination process via a structural causal graph, treating decomposed visual and textual attentions as mediators. We introduce VTACR (Visual-to-Textual Attention Contribution Ratio), a novel metric that quantifies the modality contribution imbalance during decoding. Our analysis reveals that hallucinations frequently occur in low-VTACR scenarios, where textual priors dominate and visual grounding is weakened. To mitigate this, we design a fine-grained attention intervention mechanism that dynamically adjusts token- and layer-wise attention guided by VTACR signals. Finally, we propose a dual-path contrastive decoding strategy: one path emphasizes visually grounded predictions, while the other amplifies hallucinated ones -- letting visual truth shine and hallucination collapse. Experimental results on the POPE and CHAIR benchmarks show that Owl achieves significant hallucination reduction, setting a new SOTA in faithfulness while preserving vision-language understanding capability.

Conclusion: USF-Net effectively addresses the core challenges in cloud image sequence extrapolation by providing adaptive feature extraction, improved temporal guidance, and computational efficiency, making it suitable for practical deployment in photovoltaic power systems.

Abstract: Ground-based remote sensing cloud image sequence extrapolation is a key research area in the development of photovoltaic power systems. However, existing approaches exhibit several limitations:(1)they primarily rely on static kernels to augment feature information, lacking adaptive mechanisms to extract features at varying resolutions dynamically;(2)temporal guidance is insufficient, leading to suboptimal modeling of long-range spatiotemporal dependencies; and(3)the quadratic computational cost of attention mechanisms is often overlooked, limiting efficiency in practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose USF-Net, a Unified Spatiotemporal Fusion Network that integrates adaptive large-kernel convolutions and a low-complexity attention mechanism, combining temporal flow information within an encoder-decoder framework. Specifically, the encoder employs three basic layers to extract features. Followed by the USTM, which comprises:(1)a SiB equipped with a SSM that dynamically captures multi-scale contextual information, and(2)a TiB featuring a TAM that effectively models long-range temporal dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. In addition, a DSM with a TGM is introduced to enable unified modeling of temporally guided spatiotemporal dependencies. On the decoder side, a DUM is employed to address the common "ghosting effect." It utilizes the initial temporal state as an attention operator to preserve critical motion signatures. As a key contribution, we also introduce and release the ASI-CIS dataset. Extensive experiments on ASI-CIS demonstrate that USF-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing a superior balance between prediction accuracy and computational efficiency for ground-based cloud extrapolation.

Motivation: Address challenges in UHD image dehazing: limited scene adaptability in prior-based methods and high computational complexity with color distortion in deep learning approaches.

Method: Models dehazing as progressive optimization of continuous vector field flow using Flow Matching and Haze-Aware vector field. Uses learnable 3D LUT for efficient inference and fourth-order Runge-Kutta ODE solver for stable artifact suppression.

Result: Exceeds seven state-of-the-art methods with 2dB PSNR increase, better performance in dense haze and superior color fidelity.

Conclusion: 4KDehazeFlow provides efficient data-driven adaptive nonlinear color transformation for high-quality UHD image dehazing, compatible with various networks and enabling efficient inference through precomputed mappings.

Abstract: Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) image dehazing faces challenges such as limited scene adaptability in prior-based methods and high computational complexity with color distortion in deep learning approaches. To address these issues, we propose 4KDehazeFlow, a novel method based on Flow Matching and the Haze-Aware vector field. This method models the dehazing process as a progressive optimization of continuous vector field flow, providing efficient data-driven adaptive nonlinear color transformation for high-quality dehazing. Specifically, our method has the following advantages: 1) 4KDehazeFlow is a general method compatible with various deep learning networks, without relying on any specific network architecture. 2) We propose a learnable 3D lookup table (LUT) that encodes haze transformation parameters into a compact 3D mapping matrix, enabling efficient inference through precomputed mappings. 3) We utilize a fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver to stably solve the dehazing flow field through an accurate step-by-step iterative method, effectively suppressing artifacts. Extensive experiments show that 4KDehazeFlow exceeds seven state-of-the-art methods. It delivers a 2dB PSNR increase and better performance in dense haze and color fidelity.

TL;DR: PAN is a general world model that combines LLM-based latent dynamics with video diffusion to enable interactive, long-horizon world simulation through action-conditioned video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation models lack causal control and long-horizon consistency, while current world models are limited to restricted domains with poor generalization. There's a need for general world models that can simulate diverse environments with interactive control.

Method: Uses Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture: autoregressive latent dynamics backbone based on LLM for reasoning and action conditioning, combined with video diffusion decoder for high-quality visual reconstruction.

Result: PAN achieves strong performance in action-conditioned world simulation, long-horizon forecasting, and simulative reasoning across diverse domains, outperforming other video generators and world models.

Conclusion: PAN represents a step towards general world models that enable predictive simulation of future states for reasoning and acting, unifying latent space reasoning with realizable world dynamics.

Abstract: A world model enables an intelligent agent to imagine, predict, and reason about how the world evolves in response to its actions, and accordingly to plan and strategize. While recent video generation models produce realistic visual sequences, they typically operate in the prompt-to-full-video manner without causal control, interactivity, or long-horizon consistency required for purposeful reasoning. Existing world modeling efforts, on the other hand, often focus on restricted domains (e.g., physical, game, or 3D-scene dynamics) with limited depth and controllability, and struggle to generalize across diverse environments and interaction formats. In this work, we introduce PAN, a general, interactable, and long-horizon world model that predicts future world states through high-quality video simulation conditioned on history and natural language actions. PAN employs the Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture that combines an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone based on a large language model (LLM), which grounds simulation in extensive text-based knowledge and enables conditioning on language-specified actions, with a video diffusion decoder that reconstructs perceptually detailed and temporally coherent visual observations, to achieve a unification between latent space reasoning (imagination) and realizable world dynamics (reality). Trained on large-scale video-action pairs spanning diverse domains, PAN supports open-domain, action-conditioned simulation with coherent, long-term dynamics. Extensive experiments show that PAN achieves strong performance in action-conditioned world simulation, long-horizon forecasting, and simulative reasoning compared to other video generators and world models, taking a step towards general world models that enable predictive simulation of future world states for reasoning and acting.

TL;DR: VietMEAgent is a multimodal explainable framework for Vietnamese cultural VQA that integrates cultural object detection with program generation, providing transparent explanations combining visual evidence and textual rationales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VQA systems struggle with culturally specific content due to under-represented cultural knowledge in training data and lack of interpretable reasoning processes for end users.

Method: Integrates cultural object detection backbone with structured program generation layer, uses curated Vietnamese cultural knowledge base, and dual-modality explanation module combining attention-based visual evidence with human-readable textual rationales.

Result: Developed a Vietnamese Cultural VQA dataset and demonstrated practicality of programming-based methodologies for cultural AI, providing transparent explanations that reveal computational rationale and cultural context.

Conclusion: The framework supports education and cultural preservation with emphasis on interpretability and cultural sensitivity through tightly coupled answer prediction and explanation pipeline.

Abstract: Contemporary Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems remain constrained when confronted with culturally specific content, largely because cultural knowledge is under-represented in training corpora and the reasoning process is not rendered interpretable to end users. This paper introduces VietMEAgent, a multimodal explainable framework engineered for Vietnamese cultural understanding. The method integrates a cultural object detection backbone with a structured program generation layer, yielding a pipeline in which answer prediction and explanation are tightly coupled. A curated knowledge base of Vietnamese cultural entities serves as an explicit source of background information, while a dual-modality explanation module combines attention-based visual evidence with structured, human-readable textual rationales. We further construct a Vietnamese Cultural VQA dataset sourced from public repositories and use it to demonstrate the practicality of programming-based methodologies for cultural AI. The resulting system provides transparent explanations that disclose both the computational rationale and the underlying cultural context, supporting education and cultural preservation with an emphasis on interpretability and cultural sensitivity.

### [44] [Diversifying Counterattacks: Orthogonal Exploration for Robust CLIP Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09064)
*Chengze Jiang,Minjing Dong,Xinli Shi,Jie Gui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DOC improves adversarial robustness in vision-language models by generating diverse counterattacks using orthogonal gradient directions and momentum-based updates, expanding the search space beyond traditional gradient-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing counterattack methods like TTC have limited diversity and overfit to specific adversarial patterns due to narrow gradient-based search spaces, failing to neutralize broad range of perturbations effectively.

Method: Proposes Directional Orthogonal Counterattack (DOC) that incorporates orthogonal gradient directions and momentum-based updates to expand counterattack space exploration, plus a directional sensitivity score for adaptive counterattack strength modulation.

Result: Extensive experiments on 16 datasets show DOC improves adversarial robustness under various attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

Conclusion: Enhancing counterattack diversity through orthogonal directions and momentum updates is crucial for improving adversarial robustness in test-time defense for vision-language models.

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training models (VLPs) demonstrate strong multimodal understanding and zero-shot generalization, yet remain vulnerable to adversarial examples, raising concerns about their reliability. Recent work, Test-Time Counterattack (TTC), improves robustness by generating perturbations that maximize the embedding deviation of adversarial inputs using PGD, pushing them away from their adversarial representations. However, due to the fundamental difference in optimization objectives between adversarial attacks and counterattacks, generating counterattacks solely based on gradients with respect to the adversarial input confines the search to a narrow space. As a result, the counterattacks could overfit limited adversarial patterns and lack the diversity to fully neutralize a broad range of perturbations. In this work, we argue that enhancing the diversity and coverage of counterattacks is crucial to improving adversarial robustness in test-time defense. Accordingly, we propose Directional Orthogonal Counterattack (DOC), which augments counterattack optimization by incorporating orthogonal gradient directions and momentum-based updates. This design expands the exploration of the counterattack space and increases the diversity of perturbations, which facilitates the discovery of more generalizable counterattacks and ultimately improves the ability to neutralize adversarial perturbations. Meanwhile, we present a directional sensitivity score based on averaged cosine similarity to boost DOC by improving example discrimination and adaptively modulating the counterattack strength. Extensive experiments on 16 datasets demonstrate that DOC improves adversarial robustness under various attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

*Zhen Li,Yuwei Wu,Chenchen Jing,Che Sun,Chuanhao Li,Yunde Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Composition-Incremental Learning (CompIL) for compositional generalization in zero-shot learning, addressing the challenge of continuously learning new compositions from emerging real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data continually emerges with nearly infinite, long-tailed compositions that aren't fully visible in pre-collected training data, requiring models to gradually improve compositional generalization capabilities incrementally.

Method: Proposes a pseudo-replay framework with a visual synthesizer to synthesize representations of learned compositions and linguistic primitive distillation to maintain aligned primitive representations across learning stages.

Result: Developed MIT-States-CompIL and C-GQA-CompIL benchmarks and demonstrated the framework's effectiveness through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed CompIL framework successfully enables models to progressively learn new compositions and improve compositional generalization capability in an incremental manner.

Abstract: Compositional generalization has achieved substantial progress in computer vision on pre-collected training data. Nonetheless, real-world data continually emerges, with possible compositions being nearly infinite, long-tailed, and not entirely visible. Thus, an ideal model is supposed to gradually improve the capability of compositional generalization in an incremental manner. In this paper, we explore Composition-Incremental Learning for Compositional Generalization (CompIL) in the context of the compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) task, where models need to continually learn new compositions, intending to improve their compositional generalization capability progressively. To quantitatively evaluate CompIL, we develop a benchmark construction pipeline leveraging existing datasets, yielding MIT-States-CompIL and C-GQA-CompIL. Furthermore, we propose a pseudo-replay framework utilizing a visual synthesizer to synthesize visual representations of learned compositions and a linguistic primitive distillation mechanism to maintain aligned primitive representations across the learning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

*Byunghyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UL-TTA is a training-free test-time adaptation method that adapts only logit-level parameters (class prototypes, priors, temperature) for VLMs under domain shift, achieving improved accuracy and calibration with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs like CLIP suffer from feature drift, class-prior mismatch, and miscalibration under domain shift, while existing TTA methods require backpropagation, covariance estimation, or heavy resources unsuitable for streaming/edge scenarios.

Method: Online EM-style procedure with selective sample filtering, closed-form Bayesian updates for prototypes/priors (anchored by text and Dirichlet priors), decoupled temperatures for prediction vs. calibration, and lightweight guards to prevent drift.

Result: Consistently improves top-1 accuracy (+4.7 points over zero-shot CLIP) while reducing ECE by 20-30%, with <8% latency overhead across large-scale cross-domain benchmarks (~726K test samples), with no collapse in long streams up to 200K samples.

Conclusion: Logit-level Bayesian adaptation is sufficient for state-of-the-art accuracy-calibration trade-offs for VLMs under domain shift without updating backbone parameters, making it suitable for resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot recognition by comparing image embeddings to text-derived class prototypes. However, under domain shift, they suffer from feature drift, class-prior mismatch, and severe miscalibration. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often require backpropagation through large backbones, covariance estimation, or heavy memory/state, which is problematic for streaming and edge scenarios. We propose Ultra-Light Test-Time Adaptation (UL-TTA), a fully training-free and backprop-free framework that freezes the backbone and adapts only logit-level parameters: class prototypes, class priors, and temperature. UL-TTA performs an online EM-style procedure with (i) selective sample filtering to use only confident predictions, (ii) closed-form Bayesian updates for prototypes and priors anchored by text and Dirichlet priors, (iii) decoupled temperatures for prediction vs. calibration, and (iv) lightweight guards (norm clipping, prior KL constraints, smoothed temperature) to prevent drift in long streams. Across large-scale cross-domain and OOD benchmarks (PACS, Office-Home, DomainNet, Terra Incognita, ImageNet-R/A/V2/Sketch; ~726K test samples) and strong TTA baselines including Tent, T3A, CoTTA, SAR, Tip-Adapter, and FreeTTA, UL-TTA consistently improves top-1 accuracy (e.g., +4.7 points over zero-shot CLIP on average) while reducing ECE by 20-30%, with less than 8% latency overhead. Long-stream experiments up to 200K samples show no collapse. Our results demonstrate that logit-level Bayesian adaptation is sufficient to obtain state-of-the-art accuracy-calibration trade-offs for VLMs under domain shift, without updating any backbone parameters.

*Rui-Yang Ju,Kohei Yamashita,Hirotaka Kameko,Shinsuke Mori*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DKDS, a new benchmark dataset for degraded Kuzushiji documents with seals, addressing OCR challenges in noisy pre-modern Japanese cursive script documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OCR methods for Kuzushiji perform well on clean documents but fail to handle noise like document degradation and seals, with no existing datasets specifically addressing these challenges.

Method: Created the DKDS dataset with expert assistance, defining two benchmark tracks: text/seal detection using YOLO models, and document binarization using traditional algorithms, K-means clustering, and GAN-based methods.

Result: Provided baseline results for both tracks - YOLO models for detection and various binarization methods, with the dataset and implementation code made publicly available.

Conclusion: DKDS fills a critical gap by providing the first dataset specifically designed to handle noise in Kuzushiji OCR, enabling better development of robust recognition systems for degraded historical documents.

Abstract: Kuzushiji, a pre-modern Japanese cursive script, can currently be read and understood by only a few thousand trained experts in Japan. With the rapid development of deep learning, researchers have begun applying Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to transcribe Kuzushiji into modern Japanese. Although existing OCR methods perform well on clean pre-modern Japanese documents written in Kuzushiji, they often fail to consider various types of noise, such as document degradation and seals, which significantly affect recognition accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, no existing dataset specifically addresses these challenges. To address this gap, we introduce the Degraded Kuzushiji Documents with Seals (DKDS) dataset as a new benchmark for related tasks. We describe the dataset construction process, which required the assistance of a trained Kuzushiji expert, and define two benchmark tracks: (1) text and seal detection and (2) document binarization. For the text and seal detection track, we provide baseline results using multiple versions of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) models for detecting Kuzushiji characters and seals. For the document binarization track, we present baseline results from traditional binarization algorithms, traditional algorithms combined with K-means clustering, and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based methods. The DKDS dataset and the implementation code for baseline methods are available at https://ruiyangju.github.io/DKDS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional flood mapping methods like numerical modeling and aerial photography have limitations in efficiency and reliability, creating a need for more effective real-time flood prediction solutions.

Method: Uses an image-to-image generative framework to map DEM to flood depth predictions, conditioned on simplified inundation model (SPM) with hydrodynamic priors, and incorporates transformer-based rainfall encoder for temporal dependencies.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on a 26 km study area in Tainan, Taiwan with 182 rainfall scenarios (24-720 mm over 24 hours), showing PIFF can provide accurate real-time flood maps.

Conclusion: PIFF offers an effective, data-driven alternative to traditional flood prediction methods by integrating physics-informed constraints with data-driven learning for real-time flood mapping.

Abstract: Flood mapping is crucial for assessing and mitigating flood impacts, yet traditional methods like numerical modeling and aerial photography face limitations in efficiency and reliability. To address these challenges, we propose PIFF, a physics-informed, flow-based generative neural network for near real-time flood depth estimation. Built on an image-to-image generative framework, it efficiently maps Digital Elevation Models (DEM) to flood depth predictions. The model is conditioned on a simplified inundation model (SPM) that embeds hydrodynamic priors into the training process. Additionally, a transformer-based rainfall encoder captures temporal dependencies in precipitation. Integrating physics-informed constraints with data-driven learning, PIFF captures the causal relationships between rainfall, topography, SPM, and flooding, replacing costly simulations with accurate, real-time flood maps. Using a 26 km study area in Tainan, Taiwan, with 182 rainfall scenarios ranging from 24 mm to 720 mm over 24 hours, our results demonstrate that PIFF offers an effective, data-driven alternative for flood prediction and response.

TL;DR: MACEval is a multi-agent continual evaluation network for dynamic evaluation of large models that addresses issues with current benchmarks like data contamination, human dependency, and scalability challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for large models are closed-ended, prone to data contamination, difficult to maintain, and heavily human-dependent, undermining evaluation credibility and adaptability to advancing model capabilities.

Method: MACEval employs a multi-agent network with role assignment, in-process data generation, and evaluation routing through cascaded agents for interactive and autonomous evaluation.

Result: Experiments on 9 open-ended tasks with 23 large models show MACEval is human-free, efficient (reducing data and overhead), and flexible for integrating existing benchmarks via customized evaluation topologies.

Conclusion: MACEval provides a sustainable, automated approach to large model evaluation that can broaden future evaluation directions by addressing current benchmark limitations.

Abstract: Hundreds of benchmarks dedicated to evaluating large models from multiple perspectives have been presented over the past few years. Albeit substantial efforts, most of them remain closed-ended and are prone to overfitting due to the potential data contamination in the ever-growing training corpus of large models, thereby undermining the credibility of the evaluation. Moreover, the increasing scale and scope of current benchmarks with transient metrics, as well as the heavily human-dependent curation procedure, pose significant challenges for timely maintenance and adaptation to gauge the advancing capabilities of large models. In this paper, we introduce MACEval, a \Multi-Agent Continual Evaluation network for dynamic evaluation of large models, and define a new set of metrics to quantify performance longitudinally and sustainably. MACEval adopts an interactive and autonomous evaluation mode that employs role assignment, in-process data generation, and evaluation routing through a cascaded agent network. Extensive experiments on 9 open-ended tasks with 23 participating large models demonstrate that MACEval is (1) human-free and automatic, mitigating laborious result processing with inter-agent judgment guided; (2) efficient and economical, reducing a considerable amount of data and overhead to obtain similar results compared to related benchmarks; and (3) flexible and scalable, migrating or integrating existing benchmarks via customized evaluation topologies. We hope that MACEval can broaden future directions of large model evaluation.

TL;DR: PressTrack-HMR is a top-down pipeline that recovers multi-person global human meshes from pressure signals using tracking-by-detection to segment individual pressure signals and perform human mesh recovery for each person.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional vision-based human mesh recovery methods face limitations due to occlusions, lighting issues, and privacy concerns. Pressure signals from tactile mats offer an occlusion-free and privacy-friendly alternative, but existing methods only work for single-person scenarios.

Method: A top-down pipeline using tracking-by-detection strategy to first identify and segment individual pressure signals from raw pressure data, then perform human mesh recovery for each extracted individual signal. Also built a multi-person interaction pressure dataset (MIP).

Result: Achieved 89.2mm MPJPE and 112.6mm WA-MPJPE100, demonstrating successful multi-person human mesh recovery using pressure data.

Conclusion: The method showcases the potential of tactile mats for ubiquitous, privacy-preserving multi-person action recognition, extending pressure-based human motion analysis to multi-person scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-person global human mesh recovery (HMR) is crucial for understanding crowd dynamics and interactions. Traditional vision-based HMR methods sometimes face limitations in real-world scenarios due to mutual occlusions, insufficient lighting, and privacy concerns. Human-floor tactile interactions offer an occlusion-free and privacy-friendly alternative for capturing human motion. Existing research indicates that pressure signals acquired from tactile mats can effectively estimate human pose in single-person scenarios. However, when multiple individuals walk randomly on the mat simultaneously, how to distinguish intermingled pressure signals generated by different persons and subsequently acquire individual temporal pressure data remains a pending challenge for extending pressure-based HMR to the multi-person situation. In this paper, we present \textbf{PressTrack-HMR}, a top-down pipeline that recovers multi-person global human meshes solely from pressure signals. This pipeline leverages a tracking-by-detection strategy to first identify and segment each individual's pressure signal from the raw pressure data, and subsequently performs HMR for each extracted individual signal. Furthermore, we build a multi-person interaction pressure dataset \textbf{MIP}, which facilitates further research into pressure-based human motion analysis in multi-person scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in multi-person HMR using pressure data, with 89.2~$mm$ MPJPE and 112.6~$mm$ WA-MPJPE$_{100}$, and these showcase the potential of tactile mats for ubiquitous, privacy-preserving multi-person action recognition.

Motivation: Current 3D generative models often ignore physical constraints and manufacturability considerations, particularly the need for lightweight and self-supporting structures suitable for 3D printing.

Method: The method starts from coarse voxel grids from Trellis, interprets them as continuous density fields, and optimizes with three differentiable, physically constrained loss terms plus mass regularization and restricted optimization domain to preserve outer surfaces.

Result: Achieves up to 43% reduction in material mass on text-to-3D tasks, improves stability compared to baselines, and maintains high geometric fidelity. Real-world 3D-printing experiments confirm reliable fabrication and self-supporting capability.

Conclusion: DensiCrafter successfully generates manufacturable 3D designs that are both lightweight and self-supporting, seamlessly integrating with existing pretrained models without architectural changes.

Abstract: The rise of 3D generative models has enabled automatic 3D geometry and texture synthesis from multimodal inputs (e.g., text or images). However, these methods often ignore physical constraints and manufacturability considerations. In this work, we address the challenge of producing 3D designs that are both lightweight and self-supporting. We present DensiCrafter, a framework for generating lightweight, self-supporting 3D hollow structures by optimizing the density field. Starting from coarse voxel grids produced by Trellis, we interpret these as continuous density fields to optimize and introduce three differentiable, physically constrained, and simulation-free loss terms. Additionally, a mass regularization penalizes unnecessary material, while a restricted optimization domain preserves the outer surface. Our method seamlessly integrates with pretrained Trellis-based models (e.g., Trellis, DSO) without any architectural changes. In extensive evaluations, we achieve up to 43% reduction in material mass on the text-to-3D task. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our method could improve the stability and maintain high geometric fidelity. Real-world 3D-printing experiments confirm that our hollow designs can be reliably fabricated and could be self-supporting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-generated video poses serious challenges to content security and forensic analysis, and existing detectors relying on pixel-level visual cues generalize poorly to unseen generators.

Method: Uses diffusion model inversion to recover initial noise sequences, forms Initial Noise Difference Sequence (INDS), extracts multi-domain multi-scale features, and employs feature optimization with LightGBM classifier tuned by Bayesian search.

Result: DBINDS trained on a single generator achieves strong cross-generator performance on GenVidBench, demonstrating good generalization and robustness in limited-data settings.

Conclusion: Analyzing latent-space dynamics through diffusion inversion provides an effective approach for detecting AI-generated videos with better generalization than pixel-based methods.

Abstract: AI-generated video has advanced rapidly and poses serious challenges to content security and forensic analysis. Existing detectors rely mainly on pixel-level visual cues and generalize poorly to unseen generators. We propose DBINDS, a diffusion-model-inversion based detector that analyzes latent-space dynamics rather than pixels. We find that initial noise sequences recovered by diffusion inversion differ systematically between real and generated videos. Building on this, DBINDS forms an Initial Noise Difference Sequence (INDS) and extracts multi-domain, multi-scale features. With feature optimization and a LightGBM classifier tuned by Bayesian search, DBINDS (trained on a single generator) achieves strong cross-generator performance on GenVidBench, demonstrating good generalization and robustness in limited-data settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate bronchoscope localization is challenging due to respiratory motion, anatomical variability, and CT-to-body divergence, causing misalignment between intra-operative views and pre-operative CT. Existing vision-based methods fail to generalize across domains and patients.

Method: Proposes a vision-based pose optimization framework with fine-tuned modality- and domain-invariant encoder for similarity computation between real endoscopic RGB frames and CT-rendered depth maps, plus a differentiable rendering module for iterative camera pose refinement through depth consistency.

Result: Trained exclusively on synthetic data, the model achieves 2.65 mm translational error and 0.19 rad rotational error. Qualitative results on real patient data show strong cross-domain generalization with consistent 2D-3D alignment without domain-specific adaptation.

Conclusion: The framework achieves robust, domain-invariant localization through iterative vision-based optimization, while the new benchmark provides foundation for standardized progress in vision-based bronchoscopy navigation.

Abstract: Accurate intra-operative localization of the bronchoscope tip relative to patient anatomy remains challenging due to respiratory motion, anatomical variability, and CT-to-body divergence that cause deformation and misalignment between intra-operative views and pre-operative CT. Existing vision-based methods often fail to generalize across domains and patients, leading to residual alignment errors. This work establishes a generalizable foundation for bronchoscopy navigation through a robust vision-based framework and a new synthetic benchmark dataset that enables standardized and reproducible evaluation. We propose a vision-based pose optimization framework for frame-wise 2D-3D registration between intra-operative endoscopic views and pre-operative CT anatomy. A fine-tuned modality- and domain-invariant encoder enables direct similarity computation between real endoscopic RGB frames and CT-rendered depth maps, while a differentiable rendering module iteratively refines camera poses through depth consistency. To enhance reproducibility, we introduce the first public synthetic benchmark dataset for bronchoscopy navigation, addressing the lack of paired CT-endoscopy data. Trained exclusively on synthetic data distinct from the benchmark, our model achieves an average translational error of 2.65 mm and a rotational error of 0.19 rad, demonstrating accurate and stable localization. Qualitative results on real patient data further confirm strong cross-domain generalization, achieving consistent frame-wise 2D-3D alignment without domain-specific adaptation. Overall, the proposed framework achieves robust, domain-invariant localization through iterative vision-based optimization, while the new benchmark provides a foundation for standardized progress in vision-based bronchoscopy navigation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DermBench and DermEval - an evaluation framework combining a curated benchmark and automatic evaluator to reliably assess multimodal LLMs for dermatology diagnostic narrative generation from images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable evaluation is the primary bottleneck for responsible clinical deployment of multimodal LLMs in dermatology, as current methods lack clinical meaningfulness, reproducibility, and scalability.

Method: Developed DermBench (4,000 real-world dermatology images with expert-certified narratives) and DermEval (reference-free multimodal evaluator) that uses LLM-based judging across clinically grounded dimensions for structured critiques and scoring.

Result: Experiments on 4,500 cases show DermBench and DermEval achieve close alignment with expert ratings (mean deviations of 0.251 and 0.117 out of 5), providing reliable measurement across different multimodal LLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables clinically meaningful, reproducible, and scalable assessment of multimodal LLMs for dermatology diagnostics, addressing the critical need for reliable evaluation in clinical deployment.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate dermatology diagnostic narratives directly from images. However, reliable evaluation remains the primary bottleneck for responsible clinical deployment. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines DermBench, a meticulously curated benchmark, with DermEval, a robust automatic evaluator, to enable clinically meaningful, reproducible, and scalable assessment. We build DermBench, which pairs 4,000 real-world dermatology images with expert-certified diagnostic narratives and uses an LLM-based judge to score candidate narratives across clinically grounded dimensions, enabling consistent and comprehensive evaluation of multimodal models. For individual case assessment, we train DermEval, a reference-free multimodal evaluator. Given an image and a generated narrative, DermEval produces a structured critique along with an overall score and per-dimension ratings. This capability enables fine-grained, per-case analysis, which is critical for identifying model limitations and biases. Experiments on a diverse dataset of 4,500 cases demonstrate that DermBench and DermEval achieve close alignment with expert ratings, with mean deviations of 0.251 and 0.117 (out of 5), respectively, providing reliable measurement of diagnostic ability and trustworthiness across different multimodal LLMs.

*Jerrin Bright,Yuhao Chen,John S. Zelek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamPose3D is a diffusion-based 3D human pose estimation framework that combines action-aware reasoning with temporal imagination, using action prompts and kinematic joint affinity to resolve motion ambiguity and improve temporal coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D pose estimation methods rely solely on geometric cues and predict poses independently, limiting their ability to resolve ambiguous motions and generalize to real-world scenarios. The paper aims to mimic how humans understand and anticipate motion through action-aware reasoning.

Method: DreamPose3D uses a diffusion-based framework with: 1) Action prompts extracted from 2D pose sequences to condition denoising, 2) Representation encoder with kinematic joint affinity in attention mechanism, 3) Hallucinative pose decoder for temporally coherent 3D pose sequence prediction.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on Human3.6M and MPI-3DHP datasets across all metrics. Strong performance on broadcast baseball dataset despite ambiguous and noisy 2D inputs, effectively handling temporal consistency and intent-driven motion variations.

Conclusion: DreamPose3D successfully integrates action-aware reasoning with temporal imagination for 3D pose estimation, demonstrating improved robustness to ambiguous motions and better temporal coherence compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Accurate 3D human pose estimation remains a critical yet unresolved challenge, requiring both temporal coherence across frames and fine-grained modeling of joint relationships. However, most existing methods rely solely on geometric cues and predict each 3D pose independently, which limits their ability to resolve ambiguous motions and generalize to real-world scenarios. Inspired by how humans understand and anticipate motion, we introduce DreamPose3D, a diffusion-based framework that combines action-aware reasoning with temporal imagination for 3D pose estimation. DreamPose3D dynamically conditions the denoising process using task-relevant action prompts extracted from 2D pose sequences, capturing high-level intent. To model the structural relationships between joints effectively, we introduce a representation encoder that incorporates kinematic joint affinity into the attention mechanism. Finally, a hallucinative pose decoder predicts temporally coherent 3D pose sequences during training, simulating how humans mentally reconstruct motion trajectories to resolve ambiguity in perception. Extensive experiments on benchmarked Human3.6M and MPI-3DHP datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all metrics. To further validate DreamPose3D's robustness, we tested it on a broadcast baseball dataset, where it demonstrated strong performance despite ambiguous and noisy 2D inputs, effectively handling temporal consistency and intent-driven motion variations.

*Jiarui Liu,Weihao Xuan,Zhijing Jin,Mona Diab*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TACO is a framework that reduces hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models by decomposing responses into atomic queries, paraphrasing them, and using self-consistency or self-confidence methods for confidence estimation before refining answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often suffer from hallucinations (errors in object existence, attributes, or relations) which undermine their reliability, creating a need for methods to mitigate these issues without external vision experts.

Method: TACO decomposes responses into atomic queries, paraphrases them to reduce wording sensitivity, estimates confidence using self-consistency (black-box) or self-confidence (gray-box) aggregation, and refines answers with a language model.

Result: Experiments on five benchmarks with two MLLMs show TACO consistently outperforms direct prompting and Visual Contrastive Decoding, reduces systematic biases, and improves confidence calibration.

Conclusion: TACO effectively enhances the faithfulness of MLLMs by mitigating hallucinations through self-verification and confidence calibration without external vision experts.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often suffer from hallucinations, particularly errors in object existence, attributes, or relations, which undermine their reliability. We introduce TACO (Verified Atomic Confidence Estimation), a simple framework that mitigates hallucinations through self-verification and confidence calibration without relying on external vision experts. TACO decomposes responses into atomic queries, paraphrases them to reduce sensitivity to wording, and estimates confidence using self-consistency (black-box) or self-confidence (gray-box) aggregation, before refining answers with a language model. Experiments on five benchmarks (POPE, MME, HallusionBench, AMBER, and MM-Hal Bench) with two MLLMs (\texttt{LLaVA-1.5-7B} and \texttt{CogVLM2}) show that TACO consistently outperforms direct prompting and Visual Contrastive Decoding, reduces systematic biases, and improves confidence calibration, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the faithfulness of MLLMs.

*Kaixiang Shu,Kai Meng,Junqin Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Spatial Information Bottleneck (S-IB), a framework that spatially disentangles neural network representations by optimizing Vector-Jacobian Products during training to focus on class-relevant foreground regions while suppressing background correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks learn spatially entangled representations that mix discriminative foreground features with spurious background correlations, undermining model interpretability and robustness.

Method: Proposes Spatial Information Bottleneck (S-IB) that maximizes mutual information between foreground Vector-Jacobian Products (VJP) and inputs while minimizing mutual information in background regions, encouraging networks to encode information only in class-relevant spatial regions.

Result: Experiments on five benchmarks show universal improvements across six explanation methods, achieving better foreground concentration and background suppression without method-specific tuning, along with consistent classification accuracy gains.

Conclusion: Directly optimizing VJP's spatial structure during training improves visualization quality across diverse explanation paradigms, providing a principled approach to spatially disentangle information flow in neural networks.

Abstract: Deep neural networks typically learn spatially entangled representations that conflate discriminative foreground features with spurious background correlations, thereby undermining model interpretability and robustness. We propose a novel understanding framework for gradient-based attribution from an information-theoretic perspective. We prove that, under mild conditions, the Vector-Jacobian Products (VJP) computed during backpropagation form minimal sufficient statistics of input features with respect to class labels. Motivated by this finding, we propose an encoding-decoding perspective : forward propagation encodes inputs into class space, while VJP in backpropagation decodes this encoding back to feature space. Therefore, we propose Spatial Information Bottleneck (S-IB) to spatially disentangle information flow. By maximizing mutual information between foreground VJP and inputs while minimizing mutual information in background regions, S-IB encourages networks to encode information only in class-relevant spatial regions. Since post-hoc explanation methods fundamentally derive from VJP computations, directly optimizing VJP's spatial structure during training improves visualization quality across diverse explanation paradigms. Experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate universal improvements across six explanation methods, achieving better foreground concentration and background suppression without method-specific tuning, alongside consistent classification accuracy gains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an FPGA-based deployment scheme for Animation-based Generative Codec (AGC) that achieves 24.9× and 4.1× higher energy efficiency compared to CPU and GPU respectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AGC faces deployment challenges on edge devices due to high parameter count, algorithm inflexibility, and power consumption from extensive computations and data transmission.

Method: Uses network compression (static quantization, layer fusion), designs overlapped accelerator with co-processor paradigm, implements parallelization strategies (double-buffered pipelines, loop unrolling) on FPGA hardware.

Result: Achieved 24.9× higher energy efficiency vs CPU and 4.1× vs GPU, requiring only 11.7 μJ per reconstructed pixel on PYNQ-Z1 platform.

Conclusion: FPGA-based deployment effectively addresses AGC's edge computing challenges with superior energy efficiency.

Abstract: The Animation-based Generative Codec (AGC) is an emerging paradigm for talking-face video compression. However, deploying its intricate decoder on resource and power-constrained edge devices presents challenges due to numerous parameters, the inflexibility to adapt to dynamically evolving algorithms, and the high power consumption induced by extensive computations and data transmission. This paper for the first time proposes a novel field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)-oriented AGC deployment scheme for edge-computing video services. Initially, we analyze the AGC algorithm and employ network compression methods including post-training static quantization and layer fusion techniques. Subsequently, we design an overlapped accelerator utilizing the co-processor paradigm to perform computations through software-hardware co-design. The hardware processing unit comprises engines such as convolution, grid sampling, upsample, etc. Parallelization optimization strategies like double-buffered pipelines and loop unrolling are employed to fully exploit the resources of FPGA. Ultimately, we establish an AGC FPGA prototype on the PYNQ-Z1 platform using the proposed scheme, achieving \textbf{24.9$\times$} and \textbf{4.1$\times$} higher energy efficiency against commercial Central Processing Unit (CPU) and Graphic Processing Unit (GPU), respectively. Specifically, only \textbf{11.7} microjoules ($\upmu$J) are required for one pixel reconstructed by this FPGA system.

TL;DR: Systematic evaluation of deep learning vs classical methods for energy expenditure estimation, showing transformers with minute ventilation achieve best performance (RMSE 0.87 W/kg), with significant variability across activities and individuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches rarely disentangle neural architecture effects from signal choice effects in energy expenditure estimation, and deep learning methods are under-explored compared to classical regression.

Method: Compared classical baselines with neural architectures (CNN, ResNet, transformers) across single signals, signal pairs, and grouped sensor inputs from Hexoskin smart shirt for diverse physical activities.

Result: Minute ventilation was most predictive individual signal; transformer achieved lowest RMSE (0.87 W/kg); low-intensity activities had better results (RMSE 0.29 W/kg); high inter-individual variability observed.

Conclusion: Transformers with minute ventilation provide best performance, but subject-level variability necessitates adaptive modeling strategies for practical energy expenditure estimation.

Abstract: Energy expenditure estimation aims to infer human metabolic rate from physiological signals such as heart rate, respiration, or accelerometer data, and has been studied primarily with classical regression methods. The few existing deep learning approaches rarely disentangle the role of neural architecture from that of signal choice. In this work, we systematically evaluate both aspects. We compare classical baselines with newer neural architectures across single signals, signal pairs, and grouped sensor inputs for diverse physical activities. Our results show that minute ventilation is the most predictive individual signal, with a transformer model achieving the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.87 W/kg across all activities. Paired and grouped signals, such as those from the Hexoskin smart shirt (five signals), offer good alternatives for faster models like CNN and ResNet with attention. Per-activity evaluation revealed mixed outcomes: notably better results in low-intensity activities (RMSE down to 0.29 W/kg; NRMSE = 0.04), while higher-intensity tasks showed larger RMSE but more comparable normalized errors. Finally, subject-level analysis highlights strong inter-individual variability, motivating the need for adaptive modeling strategies. Our code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/Sarvibabakhani/deeplearning-biosignals-ee .

TL;DR: RichKD enhances multi-teacher knowledge distillation by incorporating CLIP's vision-language knowledge alongside conventional visual teachers, improving accuracy, confidence, and robustness through fused logit and feature supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-teacher KD methods lack knowledge diversity as they rely only on unimodal visual information, missing the potential benefits of cross-modal representations from vision-language models like CLIP.

Method: Proposes a framework that fuses logits and features from conventional visual teachers with those from CLIP, incorporating multi-prompt textual guidance to capture both dataset-specific and semantically enriched visual cues.

Result: Consistently outperforms most existing baselines across multiple benchmarks, yields more confident and reliable predictions (increasing confident-correct cases while reducing confidently wrong ones), and shows stronger robustness under distribution shifts and input corruptions.

Conclusion: RichKD demonstrates that incorporating CLIP's vision-language knowledge as complementary supervision in knowledge distillation significantly improves performance, confidence, and robustness despite its simplicity.

Abstract: Multi-teacher knowledge distillation (KD), a more effective technique than traditional single-teacher methods, transfers knowledge from expert teachers to a compact student model using logit or feature matching. However, most existing approaches lack knowledge diversity, as they rely solely on unimodal visual information, overlooking the potential of cross-modal representations. In this work, we explore the use of CLIP's vision-language knowledge as a complementary source of supervision for KD, an area that remains largely underexplored. We propose a simple yet effective framework that fuses the logits and features of a conventional teacher with those from CLIP. By incorporating CLIP's multi-prompt textual guidance, the fused supervision captures both dataset-specific and semantically enriched visual cues. Beyond accuracy, analysis shows that the fused teacher yields more confident and reliable predictions, significantly increasing confident-correct cases while reducing confidently wrong ones. Moreover, fusion with CLIP refines the entire logit distribution, producing semantically meaningful probabilities for non-target classes, thereby improving inter-class consistency and distillation quality. Despite its simplicity, the proposed method, Enriching Knowledge Distillation (RichKD), consistently outperforms most existing baselines across multiple benchmarks and exhibits stronger robustness under distribution shifts and input corruptions.

*Le Yi,Wei Huang,Lei Zhang,Kefu Zhao,Yan Wang,Zizhou Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces a feedback mechanism in teacher-student framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation to counteract error propagation and self-reinforcing bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Teacher-student paradigm in medical image segmentation is vulnerable to erroneous supervision due to image ambiguities, leading to self-reinforcing bias through iterative error reconfirmation.

Method: Adds feedback mechanism where student provides feedback on teacher's pseudo-label changes, with feedback attributor and receiver components. Proposes dual-teacher feedback model for dynamic error correction through cross-teacher supervision.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on three medical image benchmarks demonstrate effectiveness in addressing error propagation in semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

Conclusion: The feedback mechanism successfully mitigates error propagation in teacher-student framework for medical image segmentation, with dual-teacher model providing additional gains through dynamic error resolution.

Abstract: The teacher-student paradigm has emerged as a canonical framework in semi-supervised learning. When applied to medical image segmentation, the paradigm faces challenges due to inherent image ambiguities, making it particularly vulnerable to erroneous supervision. Crucially, the student's iterative reconfirmation of these errors leads to self-reinforcing bias. While some studies attempt to mitigate this bias, they often rely on external modifications to the conventional teacher-student framework, overlooking its intrinsic potential for error correction. In response, this work introduces a feedback mechanism into the teacher-student framework to counteract error reconfirmations. Here, the student provides feedback on the changes induced by the teacher's pseudo-labels, enabling the teacher to refine these labels accordingly. We specify that this interaction hinges on two key components: the feedback attributor, which designates pseudo-labels triggering the student's update, and the feedback receiver, which determines where to apply this feedback. Building on this, a dual-teacher feedback model is further proposed, which allows more dynamics in the feedback loop and fosters more gains by resolving disagreements through cross-teacher supervision while avoiding consistent errors. Comprehensive evaluations on three medical image benchmarks demonstrate the method's effectiveness in addressing error propagation in semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

*Jiangyong Yu,Changyong Shu,Sifan Zhou,Zichen Yu,Xing Hu,Yan Chen,Dawei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FQ-PETR is a fully quantized framework for PETR-based 3D detection models that addresses quantization challenges through three innovations: QFPE for scale alignment, DULUT for non-linear function approximation, and QANS for attention stabilization, achieving near-floating-point accuracy with 75% latency reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PETR models excel in camera-based multi-view 3D detection but face deployment challenges due to high computational cost and memory footprint. Direct quantization causes severe accuracy degradation due to multi-modal feature disparity and inefficient non-linear operator quantization.

Method: Three key innovations: (1) QFPE replaces multi-point sampling with LiDAR-prior-guided single-point sampling and anchor-based embedding; (2) DULUT approximates non-linear functions using cascaded linear lookup tables; (3) QANS performs quantization after softmax numerical stabilization.

Result: FQ-PETR achieves near-floating-point accuracy (only 1% degradation) under W8A8 quantization while reducing latency by up to 75%, significantly outperforming existing PTQ and QAT baselines across PETR variants.

Conclusion: FQ-PETR successfully addresses the quantization challenges in PETR models through innovative solutions for feature scale alignment, non-linear function approximation, and attention stabilization, enabling efficient deployment without significant accuracy loss.

Abstract: Camera-based multi-view 3D detection is crucial for autonomous driving. PETR and its variants (PETRs) excel in benchmarks but face deployment challenges due to high computational cost and memory footprint. Quantization is an effective technique for compressing deep neural networks by reducing the bit width of weights and activations. However, directly applying existing quantization methods to PETRs leads to severe accuracy degradation. This issue primarily arises from two key challenges: (1) significant magnitude disparity between multi-modal features-specifically, image features and camera-ray positional embeddings (PE), and (2) the inefficiency and approximation error of quantizing non-linear operators, which commonly rely on hardware-unfriendly computations. In this paper, we propose FQ-PETR, a fully quantized framework for PETRs, featuring three key innovations: (1) Quantization-Friendly LiDAR-ray Position Embedding (QFPE): Replacing multi-point sampling with LiDAR-prior-guided single-point sampling and anchor-based embedding eliminates problematic non-linearities (e.g., inverse-sigmoid) and aligns PE scale with image features, preserving accuracy. (2) Dual-Lookup Table (DULUT): This algorithm approximates complex non-linear functions using two cascaded linear LUTs, achieving high fidelity with minimal entries and no specialized hardware. (3) Quantization After Numerical Stabilization (QANS): Performing quantization after softmax numerical stabilization mitigates attention distortion from large inputs. On PETRs (e.g. PETR, StreamPETR, PETRv2, MV2d), FQ-PETR under W8A8 achieves near-floating-point accuracy (1% degradation) while reducing latency by up to 75%, significantly outperforming existing PTQ and QAT baselines.

TL;DR: TDCNet is a novel moving infrared small target detection network that combines temporal difference and 3D convolution through re-parameterized TDC blocks to capture multi-scale motion contextual features while suppressing background clutter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Moving IRSTD is challenging due to weak target features and complex background interference. Existing methods using temporal differences lack spatial feature extraction, while 3D convolutions lack explicit motion awareness.

Method: Proposes TDCNet with temporal difference convolution (TDC) re-parameterization module containing three parallel TDC blocks that fuse temporal difference and 3D convolution. Also includes TDC-guided spatio-temporal attention mechanism for cross-attention between TDC-based and 3D backbone features.

Result: Extensive experiments on IRSTD-UAV and public infrared datasets show TDCNet achieves state-of-the-art detection performance in moving target detection.

Conclusion: The proposed TDCNet effectively extracts and enhances spatio-temporal features for accurate moving infrared small target detection by combining the strengths of temporal difference and 3D convolution approaches.

Abstract: Moving infrared small target detection (IRSTD) plays a critical role in practical applications, such as surveillance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and UAV-based search system. Moving IRSTD still remains highly challenging due to weak target features and complex background interference. Accurate spatio-temporal feature modeling is crucial for moving target detection, typically achieved through either temporal differences or spatio-temporal (3D) convolutions. Temporal difference can explicitly leverage motion cues but exhibits limited capability in extracting spatial features, whereas 3D convolution effectively represents spatio-temporal features yet lacks explicit awareness of motion dynamics along the temporal dimension. In this paper, we propose a novel moving IRSTD network (TDCNet), which effectively extracts and enhances spatio-temporal features for accurate target detection. Specifically, we introduce a novel temporal difference convolution (TDC) re-parameterization module that comprises three parallel TDC blocks designed to capture contextual dependencies across different temporal ranges. Each TDC block fuses temporal difference and 3D convolution into a unified spatio-temporal convolution representation. This re-parameterized module can effectively capture multi-scale motion contextual features while suppressing pseudo-motion clutter in complex backgrounds, significantly improving detection performance. Moreover, we propose a TDC-guided spatio-temporal attention mechanism that performs cross-attention between the spatio-temporal features from the TDC-based backbone and a parallel 3D backbone. This mechanism models their global semantic dependencies to refine the current frame's features. Extensive experiments on IRSTD-UAV and public infrared datasets demonstrate that our TDCNet achieves state-of-the-art detection performance in moving target detection.

TL;DR: Flora is a novel zero-shot skeleton action recognition method that addresses fragile point-to-point alignment and rigid classifiers through flexible neighbor-aware semantic attunement and open-form distribution-aware flow classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot skeleton action recognition methods suffer from fragile point-to-point alignment due to imperfect semantics and rigid classifiers with static decision boundaries, limiting their performance on unseen categories.

Method: Uses flexible neighbor-aware semantic attunement with cross-modal geometric consistency for robust point-to-region alignment, and employs noise-free flow matching with condition-free contrastive regularization to bridge modality gaps and create fine-grained decision boundaries.

Result: Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show impressive performance, achieving strong results even when trained with only 10% of seen data.

Conclusion: Flora effectively addresses the fundamental issues in zero-shot skeleton action recognition through its novel semantic attunement and distribution-aware classification approach, demonstrating superior performance across various datasets.

Abstract: Recognizing unseen skeleton action categories remains highly challenging due to the absence of corresponding skeletal priors. Existing approaches generally follow an "align-then-classify" paradigm but face two fundamental issues, i.e., (i) fragile point-to-point alignment arising from imperfect semantics, and (ii) rigid classifiers restricted by static decision boundaries and coarse-grained anchors. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for zero-shot skeleton action recognition, termed $\texttt{$\textbf{Flora}$}$, which builds upon $\textbf{F}$lexib$\textbf{L}$e neighb$\textbf{O}$r-aware semantic attunement and open-form dist$\textbf{R}$ibution-aware flow cl$\textbf{A}$ssifier. Specifically, we flexibly attune textual semantics by incorporating neighboring inter-class contextual cues to form direction-aware regional semantics, coupled with a cross-modal geometric consistency objective that ensures stable and robust point-to-region alignment. Furthermore, we employ noise-free flow matching to bridge the modality distribution gap between semantic and skeleton latent embeddings, while a condition-free contrastive regularization enhances discriminability, leading to a distribution-aware classifier with fine-grained decision boundaries achieved through token-level velocity predictions. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our method, showing particularly impressive performance even when trained with only 10\% of the seen data.

TL;DR: OUGS introduces an object-aware uncertainty formulation for 3D Gaussian Splatting that uses physical Gaussian parameters and semantic masks to improve active reconstruction of specific objects in complex scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS active reconstruction methods use scene-level uncertainty metrics that are biased by background clutter, leading to inefficient view selection for object-centric tasks.

Method: Derives uncertainty directly from 3D Gaussian primitives' physical parameters (position, scale, rotation) by propagating covariance through rendering Jacobian, then integrates semantic segmentation masks to create object-aware uncertainty scores.

Result: Significantly improves 3DGS reconstruction efficiency and achieves higher quality for targeted objects compared to state-of-the-art methods, while also serving as robust uncertainty estimator for global scenes.

Conclusion: OUGS provides a principled, physically-grounded uncertainty formulation that enables more effective active view selection for object-centric 3D reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved state-of-the-art results for novel view synthesis. However, efficiently capturing high-fidelity reconstructions of specific objects within complex scenes remains a significant challenge. A key limitation of existing active reconstruction methods is their reliance on scene-level uncertainty metrics, which are often biased by irrelevant background clutter and lead to inefficient view selection for object-centric tasks. We present OUGS, a novel framework that addresses this challenge with a more principled, physically-grounded uncertainty formulation for 3DGS. Our core innovation is to derive uncertainty directly from the explicit physical parameters of the 3D Gaussian primitives (e.g., position, scale, rotation). By propagating the covariance of these parameters through the rendering Jacobian, we establish a highly interpretable uncertainty model. This foundation allows us to then seamlessly integrate semantic segmentation masks to produce a targeted, object-aware uncertainty score that effectively disentangles the object from its environment. This allows for a more effective active view selection strategy that prioritizes views critical to improving object fidelity. Experimental evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the efficiency of the 3DGS reconstruction process and achieves higher quality for targeted objects compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, while also serving as a robust uncertainty estimator for the global scene.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: No standardized dataset exists for American football player tracking despite unique challenges like frequent occlusion and physical contact, making fair method comparisons difficult.

Method: Constructed dedicated detection/tracking dataset for American football players and conducted comparative evaluation of various detection and tracking methods with fine-tuned models.

Result: Fine-tuned detection models outperformed pre-trained models, and integrating fine-tuned detectors with re-identification models significantly improved tracking accuracy in crowded scenarios.

Conclusion: This work enables robust detection and tracking of American football players in challenging high-density scenarios previously underserved by conventional methods.

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) plays a critical role in analyzing player behavior from videos, enabling performance evaluation. Current MOT methods are often evaluated using publicly available datasets. However, most of these focus on everyday scenarios such as pedestrian tracking or are tailored to specific sports, including soccer and basketball. Despite the inherent challenges of tracking players in American football, such as frequent occlusion and physical contact, no standardized dataset has been publicly available, making fair comparisons between methods difficult. To address this gap, we constructed the first dedicated detection and tracking dataset for the American football players and conducted a comparative evaluation of various detection and tracking methods. Our results demonstrate that accurate detection and tracking can be achieved even in crowded scenarios. Fine-tuning detection models improved performance over pre-trained models. Furthermore, when these fine-tuned detectors and re-identification models were integrated into tracking systems, we observed notable improvements in tracking accuracy compared to existing approaches. This work thus enables robust detection and tracking of American football players in challenging, high-density scenarios previously underserved by conventional methods.

TL;DR: A Dual-Teacher Knowledge Distillation framework that uses both ViT and CNN teachers to guide a lightweight CNN student, addressing architectural mismatch in cross-architecture distillation through adaptive weighting and feature residual learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers achieve strong video action recognition but are computationally expensive, while lightweight CNNs are efficient but less accurate. Existing cross-architecture distillation methods struggle with architectural mismatch and overlook the value of stronger CNN teachers.

Method: Proposes a dual-teacher framework with: 1) Discrepancy-Aware Teacher Weighting that dynamically fuses ViT and CNN teacher predictions based on confidence and student discrepancy, and 2) Structure Discrepancy-Aware Distillation where the student learns residual features between ViT and CNN teachers via a lightweight auxiliary branch.

Result: Extensive experiments on HMDB51, EPIC-KITCHENS-100, and Kinetics-400 show consistent outperformance of state-of-the-art distillation methods, with up to 5.95% accuracy gain on HMDB51.

Conclusion: The dual-teacher approach effectively addresses architectural mismatch in cross-architecture distillation, leveraging both heterogeneous and homogeneous teachers to significantly improve lightweight CNN performance in video action recognition.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved strong performance in video action recognition, but their high computational cost limits their practicality. Lightweight CNNs are more efficient but suffer from accuracy gaps. Cross-Architecture Knowledge Distillation (CAKD) addresses this by transferring knowledge from ViTs to CNNs, yet existing methods often struggle with architectural mismatch and overlook the value of stronger homogeneous CNN teachers. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Dual-Teacher Knowledge Distillation framework that leverages both a heterogeneous ViT teacher and a homogeneous CNN teacher to collaboratively guide a lightweight CNN student. We introduce two key components: (1) Discrepancy-Aware Teacher Weighting, which dynamically fuses the predictions from ViT and CNN teachers by assigning adaptive weights based on teacher confidence and prediction discrepancy with the student, enabling more informative and effective supervision; and (2) a Structure Discrepancy-Aware Distillation strategy, where the student learns the residual features between ViT and CNN teachers via a lightweight auxiliary branch, focusing on transferable architectural differences without mimicking all of ViT's high-dimensional patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including HMDB51, EPIC-KITCHENS-100, and Kinetics-400 demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation approaches, achieving notable performance improvements with a maximum accuracy gain of 5.95% on HMDB51.

Result: Demonstrates consistent improvements across 14 medical datasets, 12 medical imaging modalities, and 13 anatomical regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, generalization, and clinical applicability.

Conclusion: vMFCoOp provides a robust solution for biomedical prompting and few-shot classification, with plans for continuous expansion to more downstream applications and resource sharing through GitHub.

Abstract: Recent advances in context optimization (CoOp) guided by large language model (LLM)-distilled medical semantic priors offer a scalable alternative to manual prompt engineering and full fine-tuning for adapting biomedical CLIP-based vision-language models (VLMs). However, prompt learning in this context is challenged by semantic misalignment between LLMs and CLIP variants due to divergent training corpora and model architectures; it further lacks scalability across continuously evolving families of foundation models. More critically, pairwise multimodal alignment via conventional Euclidean-space optimization lacks the capacity to model unified representations or apply localized geometric constraints, which tends to amplify modality gaps in complex biomedical imaging and destabilize few-shot adaptation. In this work, we propose vMFCoOp, a framework that inversely estimates von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions on a shared Hyperspherical Manifold, aligning semantic biases between arbitrary LLMs and CLIP backbones via Unified Semantic Anchors to achieve robust biomedical prompting and superior few-shot classification. Grounded in three complementary constraints, vMFCoOp demonstrates consistent improvements across 14 medical datasets, 12 medical imaging modalities, and 13 anatomical regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, generalization, and clinical applicability. This work will be continuously expanded to encompass more downstream applications, and the corresponding resources are intended to be shared through https://github.com/VinyehShaw/UniEqui.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RF-DETR is a lightweight specialist detection transformer that uses neural architecture search to find optimal accuracy-latency tradeoffs for target datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on COCO and Roboflow100-VL with real-time inference speeds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-vocabulary detectors often fail to generalize to real-world datasets with out-of-distribution classes not found in pre-training, and existing approaches require heavy fine-tuning of vision-language models for new domains.

Method: Fine-tunes a pre-trained base network on target datasets and evaluates thousands of network configurations with different accuracy-latency tradeoffs using weight-sharing neural architecture search without re-training, while revisiting tunable knobs for NAS to improve DETR transferability.

Result: RF-DETR (nano) achieves 48.0 AP on COCO, beating D-FINE (nano) by 5.3 AP at similar latency; RF-DETR (2x-large) outperforms GroundingDINO (tiny) by 1.2 AP on Roboflow100-VL while running 20x faster; RF-DETR (2x-large) is the first real-time detector to surpass 60 AP on COCO.

Conclusion: RF-DETR provides an efficient approach for discovering optimal accuracy-latency Pareto curves for target datasets, significantly advancing real-time object detection performance across diverse domains.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary detectors achieve impressive performance on COCO, but often fail to generalize to real-world datasets with out-of-distribution classes not typically found in their pre-training. Rather than simply fine-tuning a heavy-weight vision-language model (VLM) for new domains, we introduce RF-DETR, a light-weight specialist detection transformer that discovers accuracy-latency Pareto curves for any target dataset with weight-sharing neural architecture search (NAS). Our approach fine-tunes a pre-trained base network on a target dataset and evaluates thousands of network configurations with different accuracy-latency tradeoffs without re-training. Further, we revisit the "tunable knobs" for NAS to improve the transferability of DETRs to diverse target domains. Notably, RF-DETR significantly improves on prior state-of-the-art real-time methods on COCO and Roboflow100-VL. RF-DETR (nano) achieves 48.0 AP on COCO, beating D-FINE (nano) by 5.3 AP at similar latency, and RF-DETR (2x-large) outperforms GroundingDINO (tiny) by 1.2 AP on Roboflow100-VL while running 20x as fast. To the best of our knowledge, RF-DETR (2x-large) is the first real-time detector to surpass 60 AP on COCO. Our code is at https://github.com/roboflow/rf-detr

### [70] [Bridging Natural Language and ASP: A Hybrid Approach Using LLMs and AMR Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08715)
*Connar Hite,Sean Saud,Raef Taha,Nayim Rahman,Tanvir Atahary,Scott Douglass,Tarek Taha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A system that translates unconstrained English into Answer Set Programming (ASP) programs for logic puzzles using LLM and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs, generating complete ASP programs to solve combinatorial problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASP is powerful for combinatorial problems but requires programming knowledge. With increasing need for non-programmers to interact with code, this research aims to enable natural language interaction with ASP systems.

Method: Uses LLM for simple tasks (sentence simplification, keyword identification, fact generation) and AMR graphs for systematic constraint generation. Minimizes LLM dependency compared to current methods.

Result: Successfully creates entire ASP programs that solve combinatorial logic problems from natural language input.

Conclusion: This approach represents a significant first step toward creating lightweight, explainable systems for converting natural language to solve complex logic problems.

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a declarative programming paradigm based on logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning. It is a tremendously powerful tool for describing and solving combinatorial problems. Like any other language, ASP requires users to learn how it works and the syntax involved. It is becoming increasingly required for those unfamiliar with programming languages to interact with code. This paper proposes a novel method of translating unconstrained English into ASP programs for logic puzzles using an LLM and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. Everything from ASP rules, facts, and constraints is generated to fully represent and solve the desired problem. Example logic puzzles are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. While most current methods rely entirely on an LLM, our system minimizes the role of the LLM only to complete straightforward tasks. The LLM is used to simplify natural language sentences, identify keywords, and generate simple facts. The AMR graphs are then parsed from simplified language and used to generate ASP constraints systematically. The system successfully creates an entire ASP program that solves a combinatorial logic problem. This approach is a significant first step in creating a lighter-weight, explainable system that converts natural language to solve complex logic problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ARC-AGI is a challenging benchmark that humans solve effortlessly but remains extremely difficult for AI systems. The authors aim to develop a cognitively plausible solver inspired by human intelligence models from neuroscience and psychology.

Method: Uses neurosymbolic methods based on Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs) to integrate System 1 intuitions with System 2 reasoning. Employs object-centric program synthesis where VSAs represent abstract objects, guide solution search, and enable sample-efficient neural learning.

Result: Achieved 10.8% on ARC-AGI-1-Train and 3.0% on ARC-AGI-1-Eval. Performed well on simpler benchmarks: 94.5% on Sort-of-ARC and 83.1% on 1D-ARC, outperforming GPT-4 at a tiny fraction of computational cost.

Conclusion: The approach is unique as the first to apply VSAs to ARC-AGI and represents the most cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver developed to date, demonstrating the potential of neurosymbolic methods for artificial general intelligence.

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) is a generative, few-shot fluid intelligence benchmark. Although humans effortlessly solve ARC-AGI, it remains extremely difficult for even the most advanced artificial intelligence systems. Inspired by methods for modelling human intelligence spanning neuroscience to psychology, we propose a cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver. Our solver integrates System 1 intuitions with System 2 reasoning in an efficient and interpretable process using neurosymbolic methods based on Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs). Our solver works by object-centric program synthesis, leveraging VSAs to represent abstract objects, guide solution search, and enable sample-efficient neural learning. Preliminary results indicate success, with our solver scoring 10.8% on ARC-AGI-1-Train and 3.0% on ARC-AGI-1-Eval. Additionally, our solver performs well on simpler benchmarks, scoring 94.5% on Sort-of-ARC and 83.1% on 1D-ARC -- the latter outperforming GPT-4 at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. Importantly, our approach is unique; we believe we are the first to apply VSAs to ARC-AGI and have developed the most cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver yet.

*Mehrdad Zakershahrak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QDIN introduces a unified RL architecture that treats different types of queries as first-class citizens, with specialized neural modules for each inference pattern, showing that inference accuracy can be near-perfect even when control performance is suboptimal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge the traditional RL paradigm focused solely on reward maximization, and explore designing RL systems as inference engines that can answer diverse queries about their environment.

Method: Query Conditioned Deterministic Inference Networks (QDIN) - a unified architecture with specialized neural modules optimized for different inference patterns (policy, reachability, paths, comparisons).

Result: Inference accuracy reaches near-perfect levels (99% reachability IoU) even when control performance remains suboptimal (31% return), showing decoupling between representations for world knowledge vs optimal control. Query specialized architectures outperform unified models and post-hoc extraction methods.

Conclusion: Establishes a research agenda for RL systems designed from inception as queryable knowledge bases, with implications for interpretability, verification, and human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has traditionally focused on a singular objective: learning policies that select actions to maximize reward. We challenge this paradigm by asking: what if we explicitly architected RL systems as inference engines that can answer diverse queries about their environment? In deterministic settings, trained agents implicitly encode rich knowledge about reachability, distances, values, and dynamics - yet current architectures are not designed to expose this information efficiently. We introduce Query Conditioned Deterministic Inference Networks (QDIN), a unified architecture that treats different types of queries (policy, reachability, paths, comparisons) as first-class citizens, with specialized neural modules optimized for each inference pattern. Our key empirical finding reveals a fundamental decoupling: inference accuracy can reach near-perfect levels (99% reachability IoU) even when control performance remains suboptimal (31% return), suggesting that the representations needed for accurate world knowledge differ from those required for optimal control. Experiments demonstrate that query specialized architectures outperform both unified models and post-hoc extraction methods, while maintaining competitive control performance. This work establishes a research agenda for RL systems designed from inception as queryable knowledge bases, with implications for interpretability, verification, and human-AI collaboration.

### [73] [Neural Value Iteration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08825)
*Yang You,Ufuk Çakır,Alex Schutz,Robert Skilton,Nick Hawes*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Neural Value Iteration, a novel POMDP planning algorithm that represents the value function using neural networks instead of α-vectors, enabling efficient planning in large-scale POMDPs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional POMDP solvers using α-vectors become intractable for large-scale problems due to the high computational cost of Bellman backups in high-dimensional state spaces.

Method: Leverages the piecewise-linear-convex property of POMDP value functions to represent them as finite sets of neural networks, combining neural network generalization with classical value iteration.

Result: The approach achieves near-optimal solutions in extremely large POMDPs that are intractable for existing offline solvers.

Conclusion: Neural networks provide an effective alternative representation for POMDP value functions, enabling scalable planning in large-scale problems where traditional methods fail.

Abstract: The value function of a POMDP exhibits the piecewise-linear-convex (PWLC) property and can be represented as a finite set of hyperplanes, known as $α$-vectors. Most state-of-the-art POMDP solvers (offline planners) follow the point-based value iteration scheme, which performs Bellman backups on $α$-vectors at reachable belief points until convergence. However, since each $α$-vector is $|S|$-dimensional, these methods quickly become intractable for large-scale problems due to the prohibitive computational cost of Bellman backups. In this work, we demonstrate that the PWLC property allows a POMDP's value function to be alternatively represented as a finite set of neural networks. This insight enables a novel POMDP planning algorithm called \emph{Neural Value Iteration}, which combines the generalization capability of neural networks with the classical value iteration framework. Our approach achieves near-optimal solutions even in extremely large POMDPs that are intractable for existing offline solvers.

*Shouang Wei,Min Zhang,Xin Lin,Bo Jiang,Kun Kuang,Zhongxiang Dai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UCO is a reinforcement learning method that uses multi-turn interaction with two reward functions (Progress Reward and Scaffold Reward) to enable LLMs to adapt teaching strategies based on students' cognitive states and Zone of Proximal Development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM teaching methods lack dynamic adaptation capabilities and cannot distinguish genuine student understanding from answer echoing, nor perceive evolving cognitive states during interaction.

Method: Multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning with two synergistic reward functions: Progress Reward captures cognitive advancement, and Scaffold Reward identifies Zone of Proximal Development to maintain productive teaching.

Result: UCO outperforms 11 baseline models on BigMath and MathTutorBench benchmarks, achieving performance comparable to advanced closed-source models.

Conclusion: UCO effectively addresses limitations in current LLM teaching methods by enabling dynamic adaptation to students' cognitive states and Zone of Proximal Development.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are shifting from answer providers to intelligent tutors in educational settings, yet current supervised fine-tuning methods only learn surface teaching patterns without dynamic adaptation capabilities. Recent reinforcement learning approaches address this limitation but face two critical challenges. First, they evaluate teaching effectiveness solely based on whether students produce correct outputs, unable to distinguish whether students genuinely understand or echo teacher-provided answers during interaction. Second, they cannot perceive students' evolving cognitive states in real time through interactive dialogue, thus failing to adapt teaching strategies to match students' cognitive levels dynamically. We propose the Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) method to address these challenges. UCO uses a multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning paradigm where the innovation lies in two synergistic reward functions: the Progress Reward captures students' cognitive advancement, evaluating whether students truly transition from confusion to comprehension, while the Scaffold Reward dynamically identifies each student's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), encouraging teachers to maintain productive teaching within this zone. We evaluate UCO by comparing it against 11 baseline models on BigMath and MathTutorBench benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our UCO model outperforms all models of equivalent scale and achieves performance comparable to advanced closed-source models.

### [76] [The Double Contingency Problem: AI Recursion and the Limits of Interspecies Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08927)
*Graham L. Bishop*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Bioacoustic AI systems using transformers and foundation models overlook the fundamental issue of recursive cognition - how AI's recursive processing interacts with animals' recursive communication, creating a double contingency problem that distorts cross-species understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current bioacoustic AI approaches treat animals as pattern sources rather than recognizing that both AI systems and animal communication involve recursive cognitive processes, leading to systematic distortions in cross-species understanding.

Method: Philosophical analysis drawing on Yuk Hui's work on recursivity and contingency, examining the interaction between AI's recursive architectures (attention mechanisms, iterative processing) and animals' recursive communicative processes.

Result: Identifies a double contingency problem where each species' communication emerges through ecological/evolutionary contingencies while AI processes signals through architectural/training contingencies, creating mutual distortion.

Conclusion: Bioacoustic AI should be reconceptualized from universal pattern recognition toward diplomatic encounters between different forms of recursive cognition, requiring changes in model design, evaluation frameworks, and research methodologies.

Abstract: Current bioacoustic AI systems achieve impressive cross-species performance by processing animal communication through transformer architectures, foundation model paradigms, and other computational approaches. However, these approaches overlook a fundamental question: what happens when one form of recursive cognition--AI systems with their attention mechanisms, iterative processing, and feedback loops--encounters the recursive communicative processes of other species? Drawing on philosopher Yuk Hui's work on recursivity and contingency, I argue that AI systems are not neutral pattern detectors but recursive cognitive agents whose own information processing may systematically obscure or distort other species' communicative structures. This creates a double contingency problem: each species' communication emerges through contingent ecological and evolutionary conditions, while AI systems process these signals through their own contingent architectural and training conditions. I propose that addressing this challenge requires reconceptualizing bioacoustic AI from universal pattern recognition toward diplomatic encounter between different forms of recursive cognition, with implications for model design, evaluation frameworks, and research methodologies.

TL;DR: AlphaCast is a human-LLM co-reasoning framework that transforms time series forecasting from static mapping to interactive collaboration, achieving superior accuracy through automated preparation and generative reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current time series forecasting approaches lack the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts, limiting their usefulness in complex real-world domains like energy, healthcare, and climate.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) automated prediction preparation building multi-source cognitive foundation (feature set, domain knowledge base, contextual repository, case base), and (2) generative reasoning with meta-reasoning loop for self-correction and strategy refinement.

Result: Extensive experiments on short- and long-term datasets show AlphaCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: AlphaCast successfully bridges the gap between automated forecasting and human expert reasoning by enabling collaborative human-LLM intelligence, demonstrating superior performance through interactive forecasting processes.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in high-stakes domains such as energy, healthcare, and climate. Although recent advances have improved accuracy, most approaches still treat forecasting as a static one-time mapping task, lacking the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts. This gap limits their usefulness in complex real-world environments. To address this, we propose AlphaCast, a human wisdom-large language model (LLM) intelligence co-reasoning framework that redefines forecasting as an interactive process. The key idea is to enable step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence to jointly prepare, generate, and verify forecasts. The framework consists of two stages: (1) automated prediction preparation, where AlphaCast builds a multi-source cognitive foundation comprising a feature set that captures key statistics and time patterns, a domain knowledge base distilled from corpora and historical series, a contextual repository that stores rich information for each time window, and a case base that retrieves optimal strategies via pattern clustering and matching; and (2) generative reasoning and reflective optimization, where AlphaCast integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies, triggering a meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction and strategy refinement. Extensive experiments on short- and long-term datasets show that AlphaCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exact computation of extensions in ABA under stable semantics is intractable for large frameworks, requiring scalable approximate reasoning methods.

Method: Model ABA frameworks as dependency graphs with heterogeneous edge labels, propose ABAGCN and ABAGAT GNN architectures with residual layers, train on ICCMA 2023 benchmark with synthetic data, and develop polynomial-time extension-reconstruction algorithm.

Result: Both GNN models outperform adapted baseline, achieving 0.71 F1 score on ICCMA instances. Extension reconstruction achieves F1 above 0.85 on small ABAFs and ~0.58 on large frameworks.

Conclusion: This work opens new avenues for scalable approximate reasoning in structured argumentation using GNNs.

Abstract: Assumption-Based Argumentation (ABA) is a powerful structured argumentation formalism, but exact computation of extensions under stable semantics is intractable for large frameworks. We present the first Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach to approximate credulous acceptance in ABA. To leverage GNNs, we model ABA frameworks via a dependency graph representation encoding assumptions, claims and rules as nodes, with heterogeneous edge labels distinguishing support, derive and attack relations. We propose two GNN architectures - ABAGCN and ABAGAT - that stack residual heterogeneous convolution or attention layers, respectively, to learn node embeddings. Our models are trained on the ICCMA 2023 benchmark, augmented with synthetic ABAFs, with hyperparameters optimised via Bayesian search. Empirically, both ABAGCN and ABAGAT outperform a state-of-the-art GNN baseline that we adapt from the abstract argumentation literature, achieving a node-level F1 score of up to 0.71 on the ICCMA instances. Finally, we develop a sound polynomial time extension-reconstruction algorithm driven by our predictor: it reconstructs stable extensions with F1 above 0.85 on small ABAFs and maintains an F1 of about 0.58 on large frameworks. Our work opens new avenues for scalable approximate reasoning in structured argumentation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Recursive refinement in multi-agent LLM pipelines enhances reasoning by implementing gradual, incremental, sequential search, outperforming simple linear approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extract stronger reasoning capabilities from LLMs by structuring multi-agent pipelines that ensure controlled, incremental search through the reasoning space.

Method: Used recursive refinement (self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, critical feedback integration) in multi-agent pipelines with historical personas (Hamilton, Jefferson, Madison) using RAG-powered corpora to address political issues.

Result: Complex model with recursive refinement consistently outperformed simple model (88.3 vs 71.7 average scores), showing superior analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing across all test cases.

Conclusion: Recursive refinement is a robust architectural feature for enhancing LLM reasoning through gradual, incremental, sequential search.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional fluency, efforts persist to extract stronger reasoning capabilities from them. Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing. We conclude that recursive refinement is a robust architectural feature for enhancing LLM reasoning via GIS search.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAKER is the first system to solve tasks with over one million LLM steps with zero errors through extreme decomposition into microagents and multi-agent voting for error correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with extended processes due to persistent error rates that prevent scaling beyond a few hundred steps, despite breakthroughs in reasoning and tool use.

Method: Extreme decomposition of tasks into subtasks handled by focused microagents, combined with multi-agent voting scheme for error correction at each step.

Result: Successfully solved tasks with over one million LLM steps with zero errors, demonstrating scalability far beyond previous capabilities.

Conclusion: Massively decomposed agentic processes (MDAPs) provide a viable path for solving complex problems at organizational and societal scales, rather than relying solely on LLM improvement.

Abstract: LLMs have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in reasoning, insights, and tool use, but chaining these abilities into extended processes at the scale of those routinely executed by humans, organizations, and societies has remained out of reach. The models have a persistent error rate that prevents scale-up: for instance, recent experiments in the Towers of Hanoi benchmark domain showed that the process inevitably becomes derailed after at most a few hundred steps. Thus, although LLM research is often still benchmarked on tasks with relatively few dependent logical steps, there is increasing attention on the ability (or inability) of LLMs to perform long range tasks. This paper describes MAKER, the first system that successfully solves a task with over one million LLM steps with zero errors, and, in principle, scales far beyond this level. The approach relies on an extreme decomposition of a task into subtasks, each of which can be tackled by focused microagents. The high level of modularity resulting from the decomposition allows error correction to be applied at each step through an efficient multi-agent voting scheme. This combination of extreme decomposition and error correction makes scaling possible. Thus, the results suggest that instead of relying on continual improvement of current LLMs, massively decomposed agentic processes (MDAPs) may provide a way to efficiently solve problems at the level of organizations and societies.

Method: Proposed Argus framework continuously monitors ADS-generated trajectories for potential hazards and seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator when the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe. Integrated with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs (TCP, UniAD, VAD).

Result: Argus effectively enhances ADS resilience, improving driving score by up to 150.30% on average and preventing up to 64.38% of violations, with little additional time overhead.

Conclusion: The Argus framework successfully bridges the resilience gap in autonomous driving systems by providing continuous hazard monitoring and adaptive response capabilities, significantly improving safety and driving performance with minimal computational cost.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems (ADSs), with their strong capabilities in environmental perception and generalizable driving decisions, are attracting growing attention from both academia and industry. However, once deployed on public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.
  To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD. Our evaluation has demonstrated that Argus effectively and efficiently enhances the resilience of ADSs, improving the driving score of the ADS by up to 150.30% on average, and preventing up to 64.38% of the violations, with little additional time overhead.

*Yousef Emami,Radha Reddy,Azadeh Pourkabirian,Miguel Gutierrez Gaitan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper reviews next-generation autonomous vehicle optimization strategies for emergency services, focusing on Diffusion Model-augmented RL and LLM-assisted In-Context Learning to overcome limitations of conventional reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous Vehicles can revolutionize emergency services with faster, safer responses, but conventional RL suffers from poor sample efficiency and lack of adaptability in dynamic emergency scenarios.

Method: Analyzes shift from conventional RL to Diffusion Model-augmented RL (enhances robustness through synthetic data) and LLM-assisted In-Context Learning (enables rapid adaptation without retraining).

Result: Provides a critical framework comparing DM-augmented RL (robust but computationally expensive) and LLM-assisted ICL (lightweight, interpretable alternative) for autonomous emergency response systems.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a comprehensive framework for next-generation autonomous emergency response systems from a Generative AI perspective, highlighting trade-offs between different optimization approaches.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are poised to revolutionize emergency services by enabling faster, safer, and more efficient responses. This transformation is driven by advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL), which allows AVs to navigate complex environments and make critical decisions in real time. However, conventional RL paradigms often suffer from poor sample efficiency and lack adaptability in dynamic emergency scenarios. This paper reviews next-generation AV optimization strategies to address these limitations. We analyze the shift from conventional RL to Diffusion Model (DM)-augmented RL, which enhances policy robustness through synthetic data generation, albeit with increased computational cost. Additionally, we explore the emerging paradigm of Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted In-Context Learning (ICL), which offers a lightweight and interpretable alternative by enabling rapid, on-the-fly adaptation without retraining. By reviewing the state of the art in AV intelligence, DM-augmented RL, and LLM-assisted ICL, this paper provides a critical framework for understanding the next generation of autonomous emergency response systems from a Generative AI perspective.

*Zezhen Ding,Zhen Tan,Jiheng Zhang,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OR-R1 is a data-efficient framework for automated optimization modeling and solving that combines supervised fine-tuning with test-time reinforcement learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance with only 1/10 the data of previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based methods for translating natural language to optimization models require vast amounts of annotated data, resulting in high costs and scalability barriers. There's a need for more data-efficient approaches.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to learn reasoning patterns from limited labeled data, 2) Test-Time Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO) to improve capability and consistency using both labeled and unlabeled data.

Result: Achieves 67.7% average solving accuracy using only 1/10 the synthetic data of prior methods, outperforming ORLM by up to 4.2%. TGRPO provides additional 3.1%-6.4% improvement and reduces performance gap between single-attempt and multi-attempt from 13% to 7%.

Conclusion: OR-R1 provides a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution for automated OR optimization, significantly lowering expertise and data barriers for industrial applications.

Abstract: Optimization modeling and solving are fundamental to the application of Operations Research (OR) in real-world decision making, yet the process of translating natural language problem descriptions into formal models and solver code remains highly expertise intensive. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for automation, the generalization ability and data efficiency of existing LLM-based methods are still limited, asmost require vast amounts of annotated or synthetic data, resulting in high costs and scalability barriers. In this work, we present OR-R1, a data-efficient training framework for automated optimization modeling and solving. OR-R1 first employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to help the model acquire the essential reasoning patterns for problem formulation and code generation from limited labeled data. In addition, it improves the capability and consistency through Test-Time Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO). This two-stage design enables OR-R1 to leverage both scarce labeled and abundant unlabeled data for effective learning. Experiments show that OR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average solving accuracy of $67.7\%$, using only $1/10$ the synthetic data required by prior methods such as ORLM, exceeding ORLM's solving accuracy by up to $4.2\%$. Remarkably, OR-R1 outperforms ORLM by over $2.4\%$ with just $100$ synthetic samples. Furthermore, TGRPO contributes an additional $3.1\%-6.4\%$ improvement in accuracy, significantly narrowing the gap between single-attempt (Pass@1) and multi-attempt (Pass@8) performance from $13\%$ to $7\%$. Extensive evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that OR-R1 provides a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution for automated OR optimization problem modeling and solving, lowering the expertise and data barriers for industrial OR applications.

### [85] [History-Aware Reasoning for GUI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09127)
*Ziwei Wang,Leyang Yang,Xiaoxuan Tang,Sheng Zhou,Dajun Chen,Wei Jiang,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a History-Aware Reasoning (HAR) framework to address GUI agents' weak short-term memory in episodic reasoning for long-horizon GUI automation tasks, enhancing their ability to leverage historical interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUI agents exhibit weak short-term memory and history-agnostic reasoning, interpreting chained interactions as discrete screen understanding rather than leveraging historical interactions within episodes, which challenges their performance in GUI automation.

Method: HAR framework with reflective learning scenario construction, tailored correction guidelines synthesis, and hybrid RL reward function design. Developed HAR-GUI-3B model that transforms reasoning from history-agnostic to history-aware.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations across GUI-related benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of the method, equipping GUI agents with stable short-term memory and reliable screen detail perception.

Conclusion: The HAR framework successfully addresses the history-agnostic reasoning weakness in GUI agents, enabling enhanced episodic reasoning capabilities through improved short-term memory and better utilization of historical interaction clues.

Abstract: Advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have significantly enhanced Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation. Equipping GUI agents with reliable episodic reasoning capabilities is essential for bridging the gap between users' concise task descriptions and the complexities of real-world execution. Current methods integrate Reinforcement Learning (RL) with System-2 Chain-of-Thought, yielding notable gains in reasoning enhancement. For long-horizon GUI tasks, historical interactions connect each screen to the goal-oriented episode chain, and effectively leveraging these clues is crucial for the current decision. However, existing native GUI agents exhibit weak short-term memory in their explicit reasoning, interpreting the chained interactions as discrete screen understanding, i.e., unawareness of the historical interactions within the episode. This history-agnostic reasoning challenges their performance in GUI automation. To alleviate this weakness, we propose a History-Aware Reasoning (HAR) framework, which encourages an agent to reflect on its own errors and acquire episodic reasoning knowledge from them via tailored strategies that enhance short-term memory in long-horizon interaction. The framework mainly comprises constructing a reflective learning scenario, synthesizing tailored correction guidelines, and designing a hybrid RL reward function. Using the HAR framework, we develop a native end-to-end model, HAR-GUI-3B, which alters the inherent reasoning mode from history-agnostic to history-aware, equipping the GUI agent with stable short-term memory and reliable perception of screen details. Comprehensive evaluations across a range of GUI-related benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProBench is a comprehensive mobile GUI benchmark with 200+ tasks that evaluates both final state and intermediate process steps, revealing significant limitations in current GUI agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUI benchmarks only evaluate final screen states, missing critical information from intermediate steps in multi-step GUI operations. There's a need for more comprehensive evaluation that captures process information.

Method: Created ProBench with 200+ mobile GUI tasks covering various scenarios. Extended evaluation to include Process-related Tasks alongside traditional State-related Tasks, using a Process Provider to automatically supply accurate process information for precise assessment.

Result: Evaluation of advanced GUI agents revealed significant limitations for real-world GUI scenarios. These shortcomings were prevalent across diverse models, including both large-scale generalist models and smaller GUI-specific models.

Conclusion: Current GUI agents have substantial limitations in handling real-world GUI scenarios. Error analysis exposed several universal problems that outline concrete directions for future improvements in GUI agent development.

Abstract: With the deep integration of artificial intelligence and interactive technology, Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agent, as the carrier connecting goal-oriented natural language and real-world devices, has received widespread attention from the community. Contemporary benchmarks aim to evaluate the comprehensive capabilities of GUI agents in GUI operation tasks, generally determining task completion solely by inspecting the final screen state. However, GUI operation tasks consist of multiple chained steps while not all critical information is presented in the final few pages. Although a few research has begun to incorporate intermediate steps into evaluation, accurately and automatically capturing this process information still remains an open challenge. To address this weakness, we introduce ProBench, a comprehensive mobile benchmark with over 200 challenging GUI tasks covering widely-used scenarios. Remaining the traditional State-related Task evaluation, we extend our dataset to include Process-related Task and design a specialized evaluation method. A newly introduced Process Provider automatically supplies accurate process information, enabling presice assessment of agent's performance. Our evaluation of advanced GUI agents reveals significant limitations for real-world GUI scenarios. These shortcomings are prevalent across diverse models, including both large-scale generalist models and smaller, GUI-specific models. A detailed error analysis further exposes several universal problems, outlining concrete directions for future improvements.

TL;DR: Proposes a Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) pipeline and Conciseness Reward Function (CRF) to address overthinking in large reasoning models, reducing verbose responses while improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 generate verbose responses with redundant reasoning steps (overthinking), increasing computational costs. Existing length penalty approaches suffer from length collapse and training collapse issues.

Method: Developed a pipeline for training a Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) that scores reasoning path conciseness, and introduced CRF with explicit dependency between outcome reward and conciseness score to promote efficient reasoning.

Result: Achieved 8.1% accuracy improvement and 19.9% reduction in response token length on Qwen2.5-7B across five mathematical benchmarks. Method generalized well to other LLMs including Llama and Mistral.

Conclusion: The proposed CRM and CRF effectively mitigate overthinking in large reasoning models, providing both theoretical benefits (variance reduction, improved convergence) and practical improvements in accuracy and token efficiency.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling the development of large reasoning models (LRMs). However, LRMs such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 often generate verbose responses containing redundant or irrelevant reasoning step-a phenomenon known as overthinking-which substantially increases computational costs. Prior efforts to mitigate this issue commonly incorporate length penalties into the reward function, but we find they frequently suffer from two critical issues: length collapse and training collapse, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address them, we propose a pipeline for training a Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) that scores the conciseness of reasoning path. Additionally, we introduce a novel reward formulation named Conciseness Reward Function (CRF) with explicit dependency between the outcome reward and conciseness score, thereby fostering both more effective and more efficient reasoning. From a theoretical standpoint, we demonstrate the superiority of the new reward from the perspective of variance reduction and improved convergence properties. Besides, on the practical side, extensive experiments on five mathematical benchmark datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and token efficiency, which achieves an 8.1% accuracy improvement and a 19.9% reduction in response token length on Qwen2.5-7B. Furthermore, the method generalizes well to other LLMs including Llama and Mistral. The implementation code and datasets are publicly available for reproduction: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CRM.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a two-layered reliability monitoring framework for agentic AI systems to address reliability challenges during operation through out-of-distribution detection and AI transparency layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic AI systems have insufficient reliability for high-risk domains like healthcare and process industry, posing risks from unexpected behavior during operation that require mitigation techniques.

Method: A two-layered reliability monitoring framework consisting of: 1) out-of-distribution detection layer for novel inputs, and 2) AI transparency layer to reveal internal operations, providing human operators with decision support.

Result: The framework enables human operators to identify potentially unreliable outputs and intervene, providing a foundation for developing mitigation techniques to reduce operational risks.

Conclusion: The proposed monitoring approach addresses fundamental reliability challenges in agentic AI systems by combining detection of novel inputs with transparency mechanisms to support human oversight and intervention.

Abstract: The implementation of agentic AI systems has the potential of providing more helpful AI systems in a variety of applications. These systems work autonomously towards a defined goal with reduced external control. Despite their potential, one of their flaws is the insufficient reliability which makes them especially unsuitable for high-risk domains such as healthcare or process industry. Unreliable systems pose a risk in terms of unexpected behavior during operation and mitigation techniques are needed. In this work, we derive the main reliability challenges of agentic AI systems during operation based on their characteristics. We draw the connection to traditional AI systems and formulate a fundamental reliability challenge during operation which is inherent to traditional and agentic AI systems. As our main contribution, we propose a two-layered reliability monitoring framework for agentic AI systems which consists of a out-of-distribution detection layer for novel inputs and AI transparency layer to reveal internal operations. This two-layered monitoring approach gives a human operator the decision support which is needed to decide whether an output is potential unreliable or not and intervene. This framework provides a foundation for developing mitigation techniques to reduce risk stemming from uncertain reliability during operation.

*Yi-Hsien Hsieh,Ta-Jung Chien,Chun-Kai Huang,Shao-Hua Sun,Che Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MedFuse is a framework for irregular clinical time series that uses multiplicative embedding fusion (MuFuse) to better capture value-dependent feature interactions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on EHR prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical time series from EHRs are irregular with asynchronous sampling, missing values, and heterogeneous dynamics. Existing embedding strategies use additive operations that limit their ability to capture value-dependent feature interactions.

Method: Proposed MedFuse framework with MuFuse module that fuses value and feature embeddings through multiplicative modulation, preserving feature-specific information while modeling higher-order dependencies across features.

Result: MedFuse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on three real-world datasets covering intensive and chronic care. Learned representations show enhanced expressiveness and support cross-dataset pretraining.

Conclusion: MedFuse establishes a generalizable approach for modeling irregular clinical time series through multiplicative fusion, improving predictive performance on key clinical tasks.

Abstract: Clinical time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs) are inherently irregular, with asynchronous sampling, missing values, and heterogeneous feature dynamics. While numerical laboratory measurements are highly informative, existing embedding strategies usually combine feature identity and value embeddings through additive operations, which constrains their ability to capture value-dependent feature interactions. We propose MedFuse, a framework for irregular clinical time series centered on the MuFuse (Multiplicative Embedding Fusion) module. MuFuse fuses value and feature embeddings through multiplicative modulation, preserving feature-specific information while modeling higher-order dependencies across features. Experiments on three real-world datasets covering both intensive and chronic care show that MedFuse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on key predictive tasks. Analysis of the learned representations further demonstrates that multiplicative fusion enhances expressiveness and supports cross-dataset pretraining. These results establish MedFuse as a generalizable approach for modeling irregular clinical time series.

*Minlan Shao,Zijian Zhang,Yili Wang,Yiwei Dai,Xu Shen,Xin Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HyperD is a novel traffic forecasting framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components, using specialized modules for each component and a dual-view alignment loss to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traffic forecasting is challenging due to complex spatial dependencies and the coexistence of multi-scale periodic patterns with irregular fluctuations from unpredictable events like accidents and weather.

Method: HyperD framework decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component uses Hybrid Periodic Representation Module with learnable embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component uses Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module with complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. A Dual-View Alignment Loss enforces semantic separation.

Result: Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show HyperD achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, superior robustness under disturbances, and improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: HyperD effectively addresses the challenges of traffic forecasting by decoupling periodic and non-periodic patterns, demonstrating strong performance and practical advantages for intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting plays a vital role in intelligent transportation systems, enabling applications such as congestion control, route planning, and urban mobility optimization.However, traffic forecasting remains challenging due to two key factors: (1) complex spatial dependencies arising from dynamic interactions between road segments and traffic sensors across the network, and (2) the coexistence of multi-scale periodic patterns (e.g., daily and weekly periodic patterns driven by human routines) with irregular fluctuations caused by unpredictable events (e.g., accidents, weather, or construction). To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that HyperD achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, while offering superior robustness under disturbances and improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes shifting from 'model training' to 'model raising' by integrating alignment into AI development from the start through redesigned training corpora that embed values intrinsically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI training methods align models with human values only after core capabilities are established, resulting in easily misaligned models lacking deep-rooted value systems.

Method: Redesign training corpus with key components: reframing data from first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experience, simulating social interactions, and scaffolding training data ordering.

Result: Expected to lead to early commitment to values from the first training token onward, making knowledge, skills, and values intrinsically harder to separate.

Conclusion: This paradigm shift is critical as LLM capabilities overtake human capabilities in many tasks, requiring deep-rooted value systems from the start.

Abstract: Current AI training methods align models with human values only after their core capabilities have been established, resulting in models that are easily misaligned and lack deep-rooted value systems. We propose a paradigm shift from "model training" to "model raising", in which alignment is woven into a model's development from the start. We identify several key components for this paradigm, all centered around redesigning the training corpus: reframing training data from a first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experience, simulating social interactions, and scaffolding the ordering of training data. We expect that this redesign of the training corpus will lead to an early commitment to values from the first training token onward, such that knowledge, skills, and values are intrinsically much harder to separate. In an ecosystem in which large language model capabilities start overtaking human capabilities in many tasks, this seems to us like a critical need.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Qualitative research has been left behind in AI adoption, with researchers forced to use biased, opaque, and privacy-compromising general-purpose tools, creating a critical gap in scientific discovery pipelines.

Method: The authors review recent literature to show how automated discovery pipelines could be enhanced by robust qualitative capabilities and identify opportunities for safe qualitative AI in multidisciplinary research.

Result: The analysis reveals that existing AI systems fail to meet qualitative research needs for interpretation, meaning-making, and comprehensive scientific understanding.

Conclusion: There is an urgent need to develop dedicated qualitative AI systems built specifically for interpretive research to advance multidisciplinary and mixed-methods scientific discovery.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLM) are reshaping science, with most recent advances culminating in fully-automated scientific discovery pipelines. But qualitative research has been left behind. Researchers in qualitative methods are hesitant about AI adoption. Yet when they are willing to use AI at all, they have little choice but to rely on general-purpose tools like ChatGPT to assist with interview interpretation, data annotation, and topic modeling - while simultaneously acknowledging these system's well-known limitations of being biased, opaque, irreproducible, and privacy-compromising. This creates a critical gap: while AI has substantially advanced quantitative methods, the qualitative dimensions essential for meaning-making and comprehensive scientific understanding remain poorly integrated. We argue for developing dedicated qualitative AI systems built from the ground up for interpretive research. Such systems must be transparent, reproducible, and privacy-friendly. We review recent literature to show how existing automated discovery pipelines could be enhanced by robust qualitative capabilities, and identify key opportunities where safe qualitative AI could advance multidisciplinary and mixed-methods research.

TL;DR: LLM-based framework for automated barrier certificate synthesis using natural language reasoning, achieving >90% success rate on 100 dynamical systems benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current barrier certificate synthesis methods suffer from poor scalability, template dependence, and require substantial manual expertise that relies on linguistic reasoning rather than formalized methods.

Method: LLM-based agentic framework that uses natural language reasoning to propose, refine, and validate candidate certificates, integrating LLM-driven template discovery with SMT-based verification, and supporting barrier-controller co-synthesis.

Result: Achieves more than 90% success rate in generating valid certificates across BarrierBench (100 dynamical systems spanning linear, nonlinear, discrete-time, and continuous-time settings).

Conclusion: Demonstrates that expert reasoning in barrier certificate synthesis can be effectively captured and operationalized by language models, establishing a foundation for integrating language-based reasoning with formal verification in dynamical systems.

Abstract: Safety verification of dynamical systems via barrier certificates is essential for ensuring correctness in autonomous applications. Synthesizing these certificates involves discovering mathematical functions with current methods suffering from poor scalability, dependence on carefully designed templates, and exhaustive or incremental function-space searches. They also demand substantial manual expertise--selecting templates, solvers, and hyperparameters, and designing sampling strategies--requiring both theoretical and practical knowledge traditionally shared through linguistic reasoning rather than formalized methods.
  This motivates a key question: can such expert reasoning be captured and operationalized by language models? We address this by introducing an LLM-based agentic framework for barrier certificate synthesis. The framework uses natural language reasoning to propose, refine, and validate candidate certificates, integrating LLM-driven template discovery with SMT-based verification, and supporting barrier-controller co-synthesis to ensure consistency between safety certificates and controllers.
  To evaluate this capability, we introduce BarrierBench, a benchmark of 100 dynamical systems spanning linear, nonlinear, discrete-time, and continuous-time settings. Our experiments assess not only the effectiveness of LLM-guided barrier synthesis but also the utility of retrieval-augmented generation and agentic coordination strategies in improving its reliability and performance. Across these tasks, the framework achieves more than 90% success in generating valid certificates. By releasing BarrierBench and the accompanying toolchain, we aim to establish a community testbed for advancing the integration of language-based reasoning with formal verification in dynamical systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the current reasoning capabilities of frontier LLMs in end-to-end planning tasks using PDDL domains, as LLM reasoning capabilities continue to advance.

Method: Evaluated three frontier LLMs (DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5) and LAMA planner on PDDL domain and task descriptions from International Planning Competition Learning Track, including obfuscated domains to test pure reasoning.

Result: GPT-5 performance on standard PDDL domains is competitive with LAMA planner. All LLMs show performance degradation on obfuscated domains but less severe than previously reported for other models.

Conclusion: Substantial improvements in LLM reasoning capabilities over prior generations, significantly reducing the performance gap to traditional planners on challenging benchmarks.

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning remains an active area of research, with the capabilities of frontier models continually advancing. We provide an updated evaluation of the end-to-end planning performance of three frontier LLMs as of 2025, where models are prompted to generate a plan from PDDL domain and task descriptions. We evaluate DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 and as reference the planner LAMA on a subset of domains from the most recent Learning Track of the International Planning Competition. Our results show that on standard PDDL domains, the performance of GPT-5 in terms of solved tasks is competitive with LAMA. When the PDDL domains and tasks are obfuscated to test for pure reasoning, the performance of all LLMs degrades, though less severely than previously reported for other models. These results show substantial improvements over prior generations of LLMs, reducing the performance gap to planners on a challenging benchmark.

*Peiyu Li,Xiaobao Huang,Nitesh V. Chawla*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CrochetBench is a benchmark for evaluating multimodal models' ability to perform fine-grained procedural reasoning in crochet, focusing on executable correctness rather than surface-level understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior benchmarks focus on high-level description or visual QA, but there's a need to assess models' ability to perform actual procedural tasks like recognizing stitches and generating compilable crochet procedures.

Method: Uses CrochetPARADE DSL as intermediate representation for structural validation and functional evaluation via execution. Covers stitch classification, instruction grounding, and translation tasks from natural language/images to DSL.

Result: Performance sharply declines when evaluation shifts from surface-level similarity to executable correctness, exposing limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis.

Conclusion: CrochetBench reveals the gap between surface-level understanding and executable precision in multimodal models, providing a new way to assess procedural competence in real-world creative domains.

Abstract: We present CrochetBench, a benchmark for evaluating the ability of multimodal large language models to perform fine-grained, low-level procedural reasoning in the domain of crochet. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on high-level description or visual question answering, CrochetBench shifts the emphasis from describing to doing: models are required to recognize stitches, select structurally appropriate instructions, and generate compilable crochet procedures. We adopt the CrochetPARADE DSL as our intermediate representation, enabling structural validation and functional evaluation via execution. The benchmark covers tasks including stitch classification, instruction grounding, and both natural language and image-to-DSL translation. Across all tasks, performance sharply declines as the evaluation shifts from surface-level similarity to executable correctness, exposing limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis. CrochetBench offers a new lens for assessing procedural competence in multimodal models and highlights the gap between surface-level understanding and executable precision in real-world creative domains.

*Adam Tauman Kalai,Yael Tauman Kalai,Or Zamir*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Consensus sampling algorithm aggregates multiple generative models to enhance safety, achieving risk competitive with the safest subset of models while abstaining when there's insufficient agreement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many AI safety approaches rely on inspecting model outputs, but some risks are undetectable by inspection alone, requiring complementary methods.

Method: Architecture-agnostic consensus sampling algorithm that leverages models' output probabilities, aggregates k models, and achieves safety comparable to the safest s models while abstaining on insufficient agreement.

Result: The algorithm bounds abstention probability when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement, inheriting safety from the safest subset.

Conclusion: Provides a new model-agnostic approach for AI safety by amplifying safety guarantees from an unknown safe subset within a collection to create a single reliable model.

Abstract: Many approaches to AI safety rely on inspecting model outputs or activations, yet certain risks are inherently undetectable by inspection alone. We propose a complementary, architecture-agnostic approach that enhances safety through the aggregation of multiple generative models, with the aggregated model inheriting its safety from the safest subset of a given size among them. Specifically, we present a consensus sampling algorithm that, given $k$ models and a prompt, achieves risk competitive with the average risk of the safest $s$ of the $k$ models, where $s$ is a chosen parameter, while abstaining when there is insufficient agreement between them. The approach leverages the models' ability to compute output probabilities, and we bound the probability of abstention when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement. The algorithm is inspired by the provable copyright protection algorithm of Vyas et al. (2023). It requires some overlap among safe models, offers no protection when all models are unsafe, and may accumulate risk over repeated use. Nonetheless, our results provide a new, model-agnostic approach for AI safety by amplifying safety guarantees from an unknown subset of models within a collection to that of a single reliable model.

### [98] [Fundamentals of Physical AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09497)
*Vahid Salehi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Physical AI framework defines intelligence as emergent from embodied interaction through six fundamentals: embodiment, sensory perception, motor action, learning, autonomy, and context sensitivity, forming a closed control loop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a theoretical foundation for physically intelligent systems that understands intelligence as emergent from real interaction between body, environment, and experience, rather than symbolic processing or data-driven models.

Method: Develops a systemic framework with six fundamental principles that form a closed control loop where energy, information, control, and context constantly interact, illustrated through a practical scenario of an adaptive assistant robot in rehabilitation.

Result: Creates a coherent theoretical foundation showing that the six principles act as an integrated control loop enabling systems to generate meaning from physical experience rather than databases.

Conclusion: Physical AI represents a paradigm shift where intelligence is understood as a physically embodied process, with learning as structural coupling between agents and environment, demonstrated through practical applications like rehabilitation robotics.

Abstract: This work will elaborate the fundamental principles of physical artificial intelligence (Physical AI) from a scientific and systemic perspective. The aim is to create a theoretical foundation that describes the physical embodiment, sensory perception, ability to act, learning processes, and context sensitivity of intelligent systems within a coherent framework. While classical AI approaches rely on symbolic processing and data driven models, Physical AI understands intelligence as an emergent phenomenon of real interaction between body, environment, and experience. The six fundamentals presented here are embodiment, sensory perception, motor action, learning, autonomy, and context sensitivity, and form the conceptual basis for designing and evaluating physically intelligent systems. Theoretically, it is shown that these six principles do not represent loose functional modules but rather act as a closed control loop in which energy, information, control, and context are in constant interaction. This circular interaction enables a system to generate meaning not from databases, but from physical experience, a paradigm shift that understands intelligence as an physical embodied process. Physical AI understands learning not as parameter adjustment, but as a change in the structural coupling between agents and the environment. To illustrate this, the theoretical model is explained using a practical scenario: An adaptive assistant robot supports patients in a rehabilitation clinic. This example illustrates that physical intelligence does not arise from abstract calculation, but from immediate, embodied experience. It shows how the six fundamentals interact in a real system: embodiment as a prerequisite, perception as input, movement as expression, learning as adaptation, autonomy as regulation, and context as orientation.

*Niklas Lauffer,Ameesh Shah,Micah Carroll,Sanjit A. Seshia,Stuart Russell,Michael Dennis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RPO addresses self-sabotage in adversarial optimization for cooperative settings by ensuring agents remain rational, using RPG to extend adversarial methods without irrational incentives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial optimization fails in cooperative settings due to self-sabotage, where agents irrationally block task completion. RPO aims to preserve rationality while maintaining adversarial benefits.

Method: Developed Rational Policy Gradient (RPG), which trains agents in a modified game using opponent shaping to optimize adversarial objectives while ensuring policies remain optimal with respect to possible partners.

Result: RPG enables adversarial optimization in cooperative settings, finding adversarial examples, improving robustness/adaptability, and learning diverse policies without self-sabotage, validated in multiple environments.

Conclusion: RPO successfully extends adversarial optimization to cooperative settings by preserving agent rationality, enabling benefits like robustness and diversity previously limited to zero-sum games.

Abstract: Adversarial optimization algorithms that explicitly search for flaws in agents' policies have been successfully applied to finding robust and diverse policies in multi-agent settings. However, the success of adversarial optimization has been largely limited to zero-sum settings because its naive application in cooperative settings leads to a critical failure mode: agents are irrationally incentivized to self-sabotage, blocking the completion of tasks and halting further learning. To address this, we introduce Rationality-preserving Policy Optimization (RPO), a formalism for adversarial optimization that avoids self-sabotage by ensuring agents remain rational--that is, their policies are optimal with respect to some possible partner policy. To solve RPO, we develop Rational Policy Gradient (RPG), which trains agents to maximize their own reward in a modified version of the original game in which we use opponent shaping techniques to optimize the adversarial objective. RPG enables us to extend a variety of existing adversarial optimization algorithms that, no longer subject to the limitations of self-sabotage, can find adversarial examples, improve robustness and adaptability, and learn diverse policies. We empirically validate that our approach achieves strong performance in several popular cooperative and general-sum environments.

*Daniel Platnick,Dawson Tomasz,Eamon Earl,Sourena Khanzadeh,Richard Valenzano*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper compares breadth-first search (BrFS) and restarting random walks (RRWs) for escaping Uninformed Heuristic Regions (UHRs) in greedy search methods, providing theoretical runtime analysis and empirical evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Greedy search methods like GBFS and EHC struggle with UHRs (heuristic local minima/plateaus), motivating the need to compare and analyze different escape strategies.

Method: Theoretical derivation of expected runtime for BrFS and RRWs to escape UHRs, followed by empirical comparison of EHC (using BrFS) vs EHC-RRW (using RRWs) on PDDL planning benchmarks.

Result: EHC-RRW shows strong expected runtime guarantees in cases where EHC is effective, with experimental results providing insights into the relative effectiveness of both approaches for escaping UHRs.

Conclusion: RRWs can be faster than BrFS for escaping UHRs in certain scenarios, and EHC-RRW provides competitive performance with theoretical guarantees in domains where standard EHC works well.

Abstract: Greedy search methods like Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS) and Enforced Hill-Climbing (EHC) often struggle when faced with Uninformed Heuristic Regions (UHRs) like heuristic local minima or plateaus. In this work, we theoretically and empirically compare two popular methods for escaping UHRs in breadth-first search (BrFS) and restarting random walks (RRWs). We first derive the expected runtime of escaping a UHR using BrFS and RRWs, based on properties of the UHR and the random walk procedure, and then use these results to identify when RRWs will be faster in expectation than BrFS. We then evaluate these methods for escaping UHRs by comparing standard EHC, which uses BrFS to escape UHRs, to variants of EHC called EHC-RRW, which use RRWs for that purpose. EHC-RRW is shown to have strong expected runtime guarantees in cases where EHC has previously been shown to be effective. We also run experiments with these approaches on PDDL planning benchmarks to better understand their relative effectiveness for escaping UHRs.

### [101] [Practical and Performant Enhancements for Maximization of Algebraic Connectivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08694)
*Leonard Jung,Alan Papalia,Kevin Doherty,Michael Everett*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper improves the MAC graph sparsification algorithm by developing faster solvers, better optimization strategies, and automatic connectivity schemes to make it suitable for real-time applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph sparsification methods like MAC are computationally prohibitive for online use and require manual specification of connectivity-preserving edges, limiting their scalability for large, long-term graphs in state estimation.

Method: Three complementary approaches: developed specialized solver for algebraic connectivity (2x speedup), investigated advanced step size strategies for optimization, and proposed automatic schemes to guarantee graph connectivity without manual edge specification.

Result: The improvements make MAC more scalable, reliable, and suitable for real-time estimation applications by addressing computational bottlenecks and eliminating manual requirements.

Conclusion: The proposed enhancements successfully close the gaps in MAC's practical deployment, making it viable for online graph sparsification in real-time state estimation systems.

Abstract: Long-term state estimation over graphs remains challenging as current graph estimation methods scale poorly on large, long-term graphs. To address this, our work advances a current state-of-the-art graph sparsification algorithm, maximizing algebraic connectivity (MAC). MAC is a sparsification method that preserves estimation performance by maximizing the algebraic connectivity, a spectral graph property that is directly connected to the estimation error. Unfortunately, MAC remains computationally prohibitive for online use and requires users to manually pre-specify a connectivity-preserving edge set. Our contributions close these gaps along three complementary fronts: we develop a specialized solver for algebraic connectivity that yields an average 2x runtime speedup; we investigate advanced step size strategies for MAC's optimization procedure to enhance both convergence speed and solution quality; and we propose automatic schemes that guarantee graph connectivity without requiring manual specification of edges. Together, these contributions make MAC more scalable, reliable, and suitable for real-time estimation applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotics and AI systems achieve remarkable capabilities but humans remain passive observers, while robots cannot reach their full potential without effectively modeling human states and intentions and adapting behavior.

Method: The paper reviews the full human-robot interaction pipeline: from human-to-robot communication bridge translating multimodal inputs, through adaptive planning and role allocation, to control layer and feedback mechanisms.

Result: The review identifies and connects key components enabling intuitive information exchange and skill transfer between humans and robots.

Conclusion: The paper highlights trends and promising directions toward more adaptive and accessible human-robot collaboration through continuous information flow and mutual understanding.

Abstract: Remarkable capabilities have been achieved by robotics and AI, mastering complex tasks and environments. Yet, humans often remain passive observers, fascinated but uncertain how to engage. Robots, in turn, cannot reach their full potential in human-populated environments without effectively modeling human states and intentions and adapting their behavior. To achieve a synergistic human-robot collaboration (HRC), a continuous information flow should be established: humans must intuitively communicate instructions, share expertise, and express needs. In parallel, robots must clearly convey their internal state and forthcoming actions to keep users informed, comfortable, and in control. This review identifies and connects key components enabling intuitive information exchange and skill transfer between humans and robots. We examine the full interaction pipeline: from the human-to-robot communication bridge translating multimodal inputs into robot-understandable representations, through adaptive planning and role allocation, to the control layer and feedback mechanisms to close the loop. Finally, we highlight trends and promising directions toward more adaptive, accessible HRC.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ATOM-CBF is a novel safe control framework that adapts to epistemic uncertainty from out-of-distribution measurements in learned perception systems, maintaining safety for autonomous vehicles and robots without requiring ground-truth labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learned perception modules in real-world systems are vulnerable to epistemic uncertainty and fail when encountering out-of-distribution measurements not seen during training, posing safety challenges.

Method: Introduces an OoD-aware adaptive perception error margin and a safety filter that integrates this adaptive margin, allowing real-time adjustment of conservatism based on epistemic uncertainty from OoD measurements.

Result: Empirical validation in simulations shows ATOM-CBF maintains safety for an F1Tenth vehicle with LiDAR scans and a quadruped robot with RGB images.

Conclusion: ATOM-CBF provides an effective framework for handling epistemic uncertainty in learned perception systems, enabling safe operation without ground-truth labels or distribution shift information.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of real-world systems is challenging, especially when they rely on learned perception modules to infer the system state from high-dimensional sensor data. These perception modules are vulnerable to epistemic uncertainty, often failing when encountering out-of-distribution (OoD) measurements not seen during training. To address this gap, we introduce ATOM-CBF (Adaptive-To-OoD-Measurement Control Barrier Function), a novel safe control framework that explicitly computes and adapts to the epistemic uncertainty from OoD measurements, without the need for ground-truth labels or information on distribution shifts. Our approach features two key components: (1) an OoD-aware adaptive perception error margin and (2) a safety filter that integrates this adaptive error margin, enabling the filter to adjust its conservatism in real-time. We provide empirical validation in simulations, demonstrating that ATOM-CBF maintains safety for an F1Tenth vehicle with LiDAR scans and a quadruped robot with RGB images.

*Vince Kurtz,Alejandro Castro*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CENIC is a new continuous-time integrator that combines convex time-stepping with error-controlled integration, enabling fast real-time simulation rates comparable to discrete-time simulators while providing accuracy and convergence guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete-time robotics simulators require choosing a time step that presents a trade-off: large steps cause non-physical artifacts while small steps slow down simulation. Continuous-time error-controlled integration avoids this but struggles with stiff contact dynamics and speed requirements.

Method: CENIC combines recent advances in convex time-stepping and error-controlled integration, inheriting benefits from both continuous integration and discrete time-stepping approaches.

Result: CENIC runs at fast real-time rates comparable to discrete-time robotics simulators like MuJoCo, Drake and Isaac Sim, while providing guarantees on accuracy and convergence.

Conclusion: CENIC successfully bridges the gap between continuous-time and discrete-time simulation approaches, offering both the speed of discrete simulators and the accuracy guarantees of continuous integration methods.

Abstract: State-of-the-art robotics simulators operate in discrete time. This requires users to choose a time step, which is both critical and challenging: large steps can produce non-physical artifacts, while small steps force the simulation to run slowly. Continuous-time error-controlled integration avoids such issues by automatically adjusting the time step to achieve a desired accuracy. But existing error-controlled integrators struggle with the stiff dynamics of contact, and cannot meet the speed and scalability requirements of modern robotics workflows. We introduce CENIC, a new continuous-time integrator that brings together recent advances in convex time-stepping and error-controlled integration, inheriting benefits from both continuous integration and discrete time-stepping. CENIC runs at fast real-time rates comparable to discrete-time robotics simulators like MuJoCo, Drake and Isaac Sim, while also providing guarantees on accuracy and convergence.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel motion planning approach for dual-arm robots that leverages shared torso joints to overcome high-dimensional challenges, achieving real-time planning with 0.4s average times and 99.9% success rate in grocery store environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High DoF dual-arm robots face challenges in real-time motion planning due to high-dimensional configuration spaces and complex collision-avoidance constraints in unknown, changing environments.

Method: Builds two dynamic roadmaps (DRM) for each kinematic chain (left arm + torso, right arm + torso) with structure induced by shared joints, then efficiently searches through the composition of these roadmaps to avoid dimensionality curse.

Result: Achieved 0.4s average planning times with 99.9% success rate across more than 2000 motion plans on a 19 DoF mobile manipulation robot in real-world grocery store fulfillment tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully alleviates the curse of dimensionality in dual-arm robot motion planning by leveraging shared joint structure, enabling real-time performance in complex environments.

Abstract: High degree-of-freedom dual-arm robots are becoming increasingly common due to their morphology enabling them to operate effectively in human environments. However, motion planning in real-time within unknown, changing environments remains a challenge for such robots due to the high dimensionality of the configuration space and the complex collision-avoidance constraints that must be obeyed. In this work, we propose a novel way to alleviate the curse of dimensionality by leveraging the structure imposed by shared joints (e.g. torso joints) in a dual-arm robot. First, we build two dynamic roadmaps (DRM) for each kinematic chain (i.e. left arm + torso, right arm + torso) with specific structure induced by the shared joints. Then, we show that we can leverage this structure to efficiently search through the composition of the two roadmaps and largely sidestep the curse of dimensionality. Finally, we run several experiments in a real-world grocery store with this motion planner on a 19 DoF mobile manipulation robot executing a grocery fulfillment task, achieving 0.4s average planning times with 99.9% success rate across more than 2000 motion plans.

Result: Significantly reduces operator workload and enhances safety without compromising task efficiency compared to existing assistive teleoperation approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables effective human-robot collaboration through intention prediction and simulation-based training, achieving improved performance in shared control scenarios.

Abstract: In mobile robot shared control, effectively understanding human motion intention is critical for seamless human-robot collaboration. This paper presents a novel shared control framework featuring planning-level intention prediction. A path replanning algorithm is designed to adjust the robot's desired trajectory according to inferred human intentions. To represent future motion intentions, we introduce the concept of an intention domain, which serves as a constraint for path replanning. The intention-domain prediction and path replanning problems are jointly formulated as a Markov Decision Process and solved through deep reinforcement learning. In addition, a Voronoi-based human trajectory generation algorithm is developed, allowing the model to be trained entirely in simulation without human participation or demonstration data. Extensive simulations and real-world user studies demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces operator workload and enhances safety, without compromising task efficiency compared with existing assistive teleoperation approaches.

TL;DR: SCOPE is a zero-shot embodied navigation framework that uses frontier-based potential exploration with VLM estimation and self-reconsideration to improve long-horizon planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot navigation methods overlook visual frontier boundaries and fail to infer relationships between partial observations and goals, limiting planning performance.

Method: Uses Vision-Language Model to estimate exploration potential, organizes it into spatio-temporal potential graph, and incorporates self-reconsideration mechanism to refine decisions.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 4.6% in accuracy on embodied navigation tasks, with improved calibration, generalization, and decision quality.

Conclusion: Explicitly leveraging frontier information with potential-based exploration and self-reconsideration enables more informed, goal-relevant decisions in embodied navigation.

Abstract: Embodied visual navigation remains a challenging task, as agents must explore unknown environments with limited knowledge. Existing zero-shot studies have shown that incorporating memory mechanisms to support goal-directed behavior can improve long-horizon planning performance. However, they overlook visual frontier boundaries, which fundamentally dictate future trajectories and observations, and fall short of inferring the relationship between partial visual observations and navigation goals. In this paper, we propose Semantic Cognition Over Potential-based Exploration (SCOPE), a zero-shot framework that explicitly leverages frontier information to drive potential-based exploration, enabling more informed and goal-relevant decisions. SCOPE estimates exploration potential with a Vision-Language Model and organizes it into a spatio-temporal potential graph, capturing boundary dynamics to support long-horizon planning. In addition, SCOPE incorporates a self-reconsideration mechanism that revisits and refines prior decisions, enhancing reliability and reducing overconfident errors. Experimental results on two diverse embodied navigation tasks show that SCOPE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 4.6\% in accuracy. Further analysis demonstrates that its core components lead to improved calibration, stronger generalization, and higher decision quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods underutilize the reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models in robotic navigation, limiting their potential to transform the field.

Method: The framework outsources high-level planning to a VLM using: 1) structured chain-of-thought prompting for logical reasoning, 2) dynamic inclusion of recent action history to prevent loops, and 3) interpretation of top-down obstacle maps alongside first-person views for enhanced spatial awareness.

Result: When tested on HM3D, Gibson, and MP3D benchmarks, the method produces exceptionally direct and logical trajectories with substantial improvement in navigation efficiency over existing approaches.

Conclusion: This approach marks a significant advancement toward more capable embodied agents by fully leveraging VLM reasoning capabilities in robotic navigation.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are set to transform robotic navigation, existing methods often underutilize their reasoning capabilities. To unlock the full potential of VLMs in robotics, we shift their role from passive observers to active strategists in the navigation process. Our framework outsources high-level planning to a VLM, which leverages its contextual understanding to guide a frontier-based exploration agent. This intelligent guidance is achieved through a trio of techniques: structured chain-of-thought prompting that elicits logical, step-by-step reasoning; dynamic inclusion of the agent's recent action history to prevent getting stuck in loops; and a novel capability that enables the VLM to interpret top-down obstacle maps alongside first-person views, thereby enhancing spatial awareness. When tested on challenging benchmarks like HM3D, Gibson, and MP3D, this method produces exceptionally direct and logical trajectories, marking a substantial improvement in navigation efficiency over existing approaches and charting a path toward more capable embodied agents.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: UniMM-V2X is an end-to-end multi-agent framework for autonomous driving that enables hierarchical cooperation across perception, prediction, and planning using multi-level fusion and Mixture-of-Experts architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous driving systems are limited by isolated decision-making and perception constraints. While multi-agent approaches exist, they often focus only on perception-level tasks without proper alignment with downstream planning and control, failing to leverage the full potential of end-to-end autonomous driving.

Method: The framework uses a multi-level fusion strategy that unifies perception and prediction cooperation, allowing agents to share queries and reason cooperatively. It incorporates a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture to dynamically enhance BEV representations and extend MoE into the decoder to capture diverse motion patterns.

Result: Extensive experiments on DAIR-V2X dataset show state-of-the-art performance: 39.7% improvement in perception accuracy, 7.2% reduction in prediction error, and 33.2% improvement in planning performance compared to UniV2X.

Conclusion: The MoE-enhanced multi-level cooperative paradigm demonstrates superior performance in autonomous driving tasks, showcasing the effectiveness of hierarchical cooperation across perception, prediction, and planning in end-to-end multi-agent frameworks.

Abstract: Autonomous driving holds transformative potential but remains fundamentally constrained by the limited perception and isolated decision-making with standalone intelligence. While recent multi-agent approaches introduce cooperation, they often focus merely on perception-level tasks, overlooking the alignment with downstream planning and control, or fall short in leveraging the full capacity of the recent emerging end-to-end autonomous driving. In this paper, we present UniMM-V2X, a novel end-to-end multi-agent framework that enables hierarchical cooperation across perception, prediction, and planning. At the core of our framework is a multi-level fusion strategy that unifies perception and prediction cooperation, allowing agents to share queries and reason cooperatively for consistent and safe decision-making. To adapt to diverse downstream tasks and further enhance the quality of multi-level fusion, we incorporate a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture to dynamically enhance the BEV representations. We further extend MoE into the decoder to better capture diverse motion patterns. Extensive experiments on the DAIR-V2X dataset demonstrate our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with a 39.7% improvement in perception accuracy, a 7.2% reduction in prediction error, and a 33.2% improvement in planning performance compared with UniV2X, showcasing the strength of our MoE-enhanced multi-level cooperative paradigm.

Result: Outperformed 14 advanced algorithms on 39 test functions in convergence speed, robustness, and accuracy; validated on real-world UAV path planning and engineering tasks.

Conclusion: EDMO demonstrates practical applicability and effectiveness for intelligent, adaptive, and time-efficient UAV trajectory planning in field robotics missions.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), effective path planning has become increasingly important. Although traditional search methods have been extensively applied, metaheuristic algorithms have gained popularity due to their efficiency and problem-specific heuristics. However, challenges such as premature convergence and lack of solution diversity still hinder their performance in complex scenarios. To address these issues, this paper proposes an Enhanced Multi-Strategy Dwarf Mongoose Optimization (EDMO) algorithm, tailored for three-dimensional UAV trajectory planning in dynamic and obstacle-rich environments. EDMO integrates three novel strategies: (1) a Dynamic Quantum Tunneling Optimization Strategy (DQTOS) to enable particles to probabilistically escape local optima; (2) a Bio-phototactic Dynamic Focusing Search Strategy (BDFSS) inspired by microbial phototaxis for adaptive local refinement; and (3) an Orthogonal Lens Opposition-Based Learning (OLOBL) strategy to enhance global exploration through structured dimensional recombination. EDMO is benchmarked on 39 standard test functions from CEC2017 and CEC2020, outperforming 14 advanced algorithms in convergence speed, robustness, and optimization accuracy. Furthermore, real-world validations on UAV three-dimensional path planning and three engineering design tasks confirm its practical applicability and effectiveness in field robotics missions requiring intelligent, adaptive, and time-efficient planning.

Conclusion: SMF-VO establishes a scalable and efficient alternative to traditional VO/VIO methods, making it highly suitable for mobile robotics and wearable devices where computational resources are limited.

Abstract: Traditional Visual Odometry (VO) and Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) methods rely on a 'pose-centric' paradigm, which computes absolute camera poses from the local map thus requires large-scale landmark maintenance and continuous map optimization. This approach is computationally expensive, limiting their real-time performance on resource-constrained devices. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Sparse Motion Field Visual Odometry (SMF-VO), a lightweight, 'motion-centric' framework. Our approach directly estimates instantaneous linear and angular velocity from sparse optical flow, bypassing the need for explicit pose estimation or expensive landmark tracking. We also employed a generalized 3D ray-based motion field formulation that works accurately with various camera models, including wide-field-of-view lenses. SMF-VO demonstrates superior efficiency and competitive accuracy on benchmark datasets, achieving over 100 FPS on a Raspberry Pi 5 using only a CPU. Our work establishes a scalable and efficient alternative to conventional methods, making it highly suitable for mobile robotics and wearable devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion tracking methods require extensive tuning and rely on reference data during deployment, limiting adaptability in legged robotics.

Method: APEX integrates expert demonstrations into RL using decaying action priors that initially bias exploration toward demonstrations but gradually allow independent exploration, combined with a multi-critic framework balancing task performance and motion style.

Result: The method enables single policies to learn diverse motions and transfer reference-like styles across different terrains and velocities, with validation in simulation and on Unitree Go2 robot showing improved stability, efficiency, and generalization.

Conclusion: APEX paves the way for guidance-driven RL to boost natural skill acquisition in robotic tasks from locomotion to manipulation by leveraging demonstrations to guide exploration without imposing explicit bias.

Abstract: Learning natural, animal-like locomotion from demonstrations has become a core paradigm in legged robotics. Despite the recent advancements in motion tracking, most existing methods demand extensive tuning and rely on reference data during deployment, limiting adaptability. We present APEX (Action Priors enable Efficient Exploration), a plug-and-play extension to state-of-the-art motion tracking algorithms that eliminates any dependence on reference data during deployment, improves sample efficiency, and reduces parameter tuning effort. APEX integrates expert demonstrations directly into reinforcement learning (RL) by incorporating decaying action priors, which initially bias exploration toward expert demonstrations but gradually allow the policy to explore independently. This is combined with a multi-critic framework that balances task performance with motion style. Moreover, APEX enables a single policy to learn diverse motions and transfer reference-like styles across different terrains and velocities, while remaining robust to variations in reward design. We validate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments in both simulation and on a Unitree Go2 robot. By leveraging demonstrations to guide exploration during RL training, without imposing explicit bias toward them, APEX enables legged robots to learn with greater stability, efficiency, and generalization. We believe this approach paves the way for guidance-driven RL to boost natural skill acquisition in a wide array of robotic tasks, from locomotion to manipulation.

TL;DR: A unified framework for real-time independent torque and stiffness control in soft actuators that maintains decoupling through dynamic contact transients using co-contraction/bias coordinates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing controllers for soft muscles struggle to maintain independent torque-stiffness control through dynamic contact transients, limiting their potential for safe human-robot interaction.

Method: Developed a unified force law capturing diverse soft muscle physics with sub-ms computation, and a cascaded controller with analytical inverse dynamics using co-contraction/bias coordinates to independently modulate torque via bias and stiffness via co-contraction.

Result: Achieved maintained independence with 200x faster settling on soft surfaces, 81% force reduction on rigid surfaces, and stable interaction vs 22-54% stability for fixed policies.

Conclusion: The framework enables musculoskeletal antagonistic systems to execute adaptive impedance control for safe human-robot interaction, providing a foundation for advanced soft actuator applications.

Abstract: Antagonistic soft actuators built from artificial muscles (PAMs, HASELs, DEAs) promise plant-level torque-stiffness decoupling, yet existing controllers for soft muscles struggle to maintain independent control through dynamic contact transients. We present a unified framework enabling independent torque and stiffness commands in real-time for diverse soft actuator types. Our unified force law captures diverse soft muscle physics in a single model with sub-ms computation, while our cascaded controller with analytical inverse dynamics maintains decoupling despite model errors and disturbances. Using co-contraction/bias coordinates, the controller independently modulates torque via bias and stiffness via co-contraction-replicating biological impedance strategies. Simulation-based validation through contact experiments demonstrates maintained independence: 200x faster settling on soft surfaces, 81% force reduction on rigid surfaces, and stable interaction vs 22-54% stability for fixed policies. This framework provides a foundation for enabling musculoskeletal antagonistic systems to execute adaptive impedance control for safe human-robot interaction.

*Jiahao Xiao,Bowen Yan,Jianbo Zhang,Jia Wang,Chunyi Li,Zhengxue Cheng,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces two data-driven tools for evaluating embodied intelligence datasets: diversity entropy to measure information content, and an interpretable algorithm to quantify dataset learnability without model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dataset evaluation methods focus on diversity through task/scene counting or isolated modality assessment, which is incomplete. Learnability is typically evaluated through expensive post-hoc model training that lacks interpretability and guidance for improvement.

Method: 1) Construct unified multimodal representations for data samples and propose diversity entropy as a continuous measure of dataset information content. 2) Introduce the first interpretable, data-driven algorithm to efficiently quantify dataset learnability without requiring model training.

Result: The proposed algorithm was validated on both simulated and real-world embodied datasets, demonstrating faithful, actionable insights that enable joint improvement of diversity and learnability.

Conclusion: This work provides a foundation for designing higher-quality datasets to advance embodied intelligence development by offering principled tools for comprehensive dataset evaluation.

Abstract: In embodied intelligence, datasets play a pivotal role, serving as both a knowledge repository and a conduit for information transfer. The two most critical attributes of a dataset are the amount of information it provides and how easily this information can be learned by models. However, the multimodal nature of embodied data makes evaluating these properties particularly challenging. Prior work has largely focused on diversity, typically counting tasks and scenes or evaluating isolated modalities, which fails to provide a comprehensive picture of dataset diversity. On the other hand, the learnability of datasets has received little attention and is usually assessed post-hoc through model training, an expensive, time-consuming process that also lacks interpretability, offering little guidance on how to improve a dataset. In this work, we address both challenges by introducing two principled, data-driven tools. First, we construct a unified multimodal representation for each data sample and, based on it, propose diversity entropy, a continuous measure that characterizes the amount of information contained in a dataset. Second, we introduce the first interpretable, data-driven algorithm to efficiently quantify dataset learnability without training, enabling researchers to assess a dataset's learnability immediately upon its release. We validate our algorithm on both simulated and real-world embodied datasets, demonstrating that it yields faithful, actionable insights that enable researchers to jointly improve diversity and learnability. We hope this work provides a foundation for designing higher-quality datasets that advance the development of embodied intelligence.

TL;DR: RGMP is an end-to-end framework that unifies geometric-semantic skill reasoning with data-efficient visuomotor control for humanoid robots, achieving 87% task success and 5x greater data efficiency than state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data-driven approaches for humanoid robots require extensive training datasets, neglect geometric reasoning in unseen scenarios, and inefficiently model robot-target relationships, leading to wasted training resources.

Method: RGMP combines a Geometric-prior Skill Selector that infuses geometric inductive biases into vision language models for adaptive skill sequences, and an Adaptive Recursive Gaussian Network that parameterizes robot-object interactions as a compact hierarchy of Gaussian processes for data-efficient motion synthesis.

Result: The framework achieves 87% task success in generalization tests and exhibits 5x greater data efficiency than state-of-the-art models when evaluated on both humanoid and desktop dual-arm robots.

Conclusion: RGMP demonstrates superior cross-domain generalization enabled by geometric-semantic reasoning and recursive-Gaussian adaptation, providing a more efficient and robust solution for humanoid robot skill execution.

Abstract: Humanoid robots exhibit significant potential in executing diverse human-level skills. However, current research predominantly relies on data-driven approaches that necessitate extensive training datasets to achieve robust multimodal decision-making capabilities and generalizable visuomotor control. These methods raise concerns due to the neglect of geometric reasoning in unseen scenarios and the inefficient modeling of robot-target relationships within the training data, resulting in significant waste of training resources. To address these limitations, we present the Recurrent Geometric-prior Multimodal Policy (RGMP), an end-to-end framework that unifies geometric-semantic skill reasoning with data-efficient visuomotor control. For perception capabilities, we propose the Geometric-prior Skill Selector, which infuses geometric inductive biases into a vision language model, producing adaptive skill sequences for unseen scenes with minimal spatial common sense tuning. To achieve data-efficient robotic motion synthesis, we introduce the Adaptive Recursive Gaussian Network, which parameterizes robot-object interactions as a compact hierarchy of Gaussian processes that recursively encode multi-scale spatial relationships, yielding dexterous, data-efficient motion synthesis even from sparse demonstrations. Evaluated on both our humanoid robot and desktop dual-arm robot, the RGMP framework achieves 87% task success in generalization tests and exhibits 5x greater data efficiency than the state-of-the-art model. This performance underscores its superior cross-domain generalization, enabled by geometric-semantic reasoning and recursive-Gaussion adaptation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LODESTAR is a novel LiDAR-inertial odometry method that addresses performance degradation in degenerate environments through degeneracy-aware adaptive Schmidt-Kalman filtering and degeneracy-aware data exploitation to handle measurement sparsity and imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR-inertial odometry performance degrades in degenerate environments like long corridors and high-altitude flights where LiDAR measurements are imbalanced or sparse, leading to ill-posed state estimation.

Method: Uses two key modules: DA-ASKF (degeneracy-aware adaptive Schmidt-Kalman filter) with sliding window and degeneracy-aware sliding modes that classify states as active/fixed based on degeneracy level, and DA-DE (degeneracy-aware data exploitation) that prunes less-informative measurements and selectively exploits measurements from fixed states based on localizability contribution.

Result: Experimental results show LODESTAR outperforms existing LiDAR-based odometry methods and degeneracy-aware modules in terms of accuracy and robustness under various degenerate conditions.

Conclusion: LODESTAR successfully addresses degeneracy issues in LIO through degeneracy-aware constrained optimization and measurement handling, improving performance in challenging environments.

Abstract: LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) has been widely used in robotics due to its high accuracy. However, its performance degrades in degenerate environments, such as long corridors and high-altitude flights, where LiDAR measurements are imbalanced or sparse, leading to ill-posed state estimation. In this letter, we present LODESTAR, a novel LIO method that addresses these degeneracies through two key modules: degeneracy-aware adaptive Schmidt-Kalman filter (DA-ASKF) and degeneracy-aware data exploitation (DA-DE). DA-ASKF employs a sliding window to utilize past states and measurements as additional constraints. Specifically, it introduces degeneracy-aware sliding modes that adaptively classify states as active or fixed based on their degeneracy level. Using Schmidt-Kalman update, it partially optimizes active states while preserving fixed states. These fixed states influence the update of active states via their covariances, serving as reference anchors--akin to a lodestar. Additionally, DA-DE prunes less-informative measurements from active states and selectively exploits measurements from fixed states, based on their localizability contribution and the condition number of the Jacobian matrix. Consequently, DA-ASKF enables degeneracy-aware constrained optimization and mitigates measurement sparsity, while DA-DE addresses measurement imbalance. Experimental results show that LODESTAR outperforms existing LiDAR-based odometry methods and degeneracy-aware modules in terms of accuracy and robustness under various degenerate conditions.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses data scaling bottleneck in robot learning by leveraging abundant human motion data. SCHUR framework shows effectiveness in real-world humanoid robot deployment, enabling scalable high-level control learning.

Abstract: Data scaling has long remained a critical bottleneck in robot learning. For humanoid robots, human videos and motion data are abundant and widely available, offering a free and large-scale data source. Besides, the semantics related to the motions enable modality alignment and high-level robot control learning. However, how to effectively mine raw video, extract robot-learnable representations, and leverage them for scalable learning remains an open problem. To address this, we introduce Humanoid-Union, a large-scale dataset generated through an autonomous pipeline, comprising over 260 hours of diverse, high-quality humanoid robot motion data with semantic annotations derived from human motion videos. The dataset can be further expanded via the same pipeline. Building on this data resource, we propose SCHUR, a scalable learning framework designed to explore the impact of large-scale data on high-level control in humanoid robots. Experimental results demonstrate that SCHUR achieves high robot motion generation quality and strong text-motion alignment under data and model scaling, with 37\% reconstruction improvement under MPJPE and 25\% alignment improvement under FID comparing with previous methods. Its effectiveness is further validated through deployment in real-world humanoid robot.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of collecting large-scale, high-quality demonstration data for robotic learning, overcoming limitations of existing methods like UMI which only capture RGB images without 3D geometric information.

Method: Two key components: (1) Cloud-UMI handheld device that records point cloud observation-action pairs without requiring visual SLAM, and (2) visibility-aware optimization mechanism that extends DemoGen pipeline to generate only points within camera's field of view for egocentric 3D observations.

Result: UMIGen enables efficient data generation that aligns with real egocentric observations and can be directly transferred across different robot embodiments without post-processing. Experiments show strong cross-embodiment generalization and accelerated data collection in diverse manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed UMIGen framework successfully addresses data collection challenges in robotic manipulation by providing 3D geometric information and supporting cross-embodiment transfer, demonstrating practical effectiveness in both simulated and real-world settings.

Abstract: Data-driven robotic learning faces an obvious dilemma: robust policies demand large-scale, high-quality demonstration data, yet collecting such data remains a major challenge owing to high operational costs, dependence on specialized hardware, and the limited spatial generalization capability of current methods. The Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI) relaxes the strict hardware requirements for data collection, but it is restricted to capturing only RGB images of a scene and omits the 3D geometric information on which many tasks rely. Inspired by DemoGen, we propose UMIGen, a unified framework that consists of two key components: (1) Cloud-UMI, a handheld data collection device that requires no visual SLAM and simultaneously records point cloud observation-action pairs; and (2) a visibility-aware optimization mechanism that extends the DemoGen pipeline to egocentric 3D observations by generating only points within the camera's field of view. These two components enable efficient data generation that aligns with real egocentric observations and can be directly transferred across different robot embodiments without any post-processing. Experiments in both simulated and real-world settings demonstrate that UMIGen supports strong cross-embodiment generalization and accelerates data collection in diverse manipulation tasks.

TL;DR: CoRL-MPPI combines Cooperative Reinforcement Learning with Model Predictive Path Integral control to improve decentralized multi-robot collision avoidance by guiding MPPI's sampling with learned cooperative policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard MPPI controllers provide suboptimal trajectories due to uninformed random sampling, limiting their effectiveness in dense multi-robot navigation scenarios.

Method: Train a deep neural network policy in simulation to learn local cooperative collision avoidance behaviors, then embed this learned policy into MPPI to bias its sampling distribution toward more intelligent actions.

Result: CoRL-MPPI significantly improves navigation efficiency (success rate and makespan) and safety compared to ORCA, BVC, and multi-agent MPPI baselines in dense dynamic environments.

Conclusion: The approach enables agile and robust multi-robot navigation while preserving all theoretical guarantees of regular MPPI.

Abstract: Decentralized collision avoidance remains a core challenge for scalable multi-robot systems. One of the promising approaches to tackle this problem is Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) -- a framework that is naturally suited to handle any robot motion model and provides strong theoretical guarantees. Still, in practice MPPI-based controller may provide suboptimal trajectories as its performance relies heavily on uninformed random sampling. In this work, we introduce CoRL-MPPI, a novel fusion of Cooperative Reinforcement Learning and MPPI to address this limitation. We train an action policy (approximated as deep neural network) in simulation that learns local cooperative collision avoidance behaviors. This learned policy is then embedded into the MPPI framework to guide its sampling distribution, biasing it towards more intelligent and cooperative actions. Notably, CoRL-MPPI preserves all the theoretical guarantees of regular MPPI. We evaluate our approach in dense, dynamic simulation environments against state-of-the-art baselines, including ORCA, BVC, and a multi-agent MPPI implementation. Our results demonstrate that CoRL-MPPI significantly improves navigation efficiency (measured by success rate and makespan) and safety, enabling agile and robust multi-robot navigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robot-specific data collection is expensive, while abundant human motion data exists but cannot be directly used due to embodiment gaps and missing dynamic information like force/torque.

Method: Physics-based retargeting framework that uses human demonstrations for task structure/objectives, and large-scale physics-based sampling with curriculum-style virtual contact guidance to refine trajectories for dynamical feasibility.

Result: Scales across 9 humanoid/dexterous hand embodiments and 6 datasets, improves success rates by 18% vs standard sampling, 10X faster than RL baselines, and generates 2.4M frames of dynamic-feasible robot data.

Conclusion: SPIDER serves as a universal physics-based retargeting method that works with diverse quality data and generates high-quality data to enable efficient policy learning for robots.

Abstract: Learning dexterous and agile policy for humanoid and dexterous hand control requires large-scale demonstrations, but collecting robot-specific data is prohibitively expensive. In contrast, abundant human motion data is readily available from motion capture, videos, and virtual reality, which could help address the data scarcity problem. However, due to the embodiment gap and missing dynamic information like force and torque, these demonstrations cannot be directly executed on robots. To bridge this gap, we propose Scalable Physics-Informed DExterous Retargeting (SPIDER), a physics-based retargeting framework to transform and augment kinematic-only human demonstrations to dynamically feasible robot trajectories at scale. Our key insight is that human demonstrations should provide global task structure and objective, while large-scale physics-based sampling with curriculum-style virtual contact guidance should refine trajectories to ensure dynamical feasibility and correct contact sequences. SPIDER scales across diverse 9 humanoid/dexterous hand embodiments and 6 datasets, improving success rates by 18% compared to standard sampling, while being 10X faster than reinforcement learning (RL) baselines, and enabling the generation of a 2.4M frames dynamic-feasible robot dataset for policy learning. As a universal physics-based retargeting method, SPIDER can work with diverse quality data and generate diverse and high-quality data to enable efficient policy learning with methods like RL.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: WMPO is a world-model-based policy optimization framework that enables Vision-Language-Action models to perform on-policy reinforcement learning without real environment interactions, improving sample efficiency and enabling emergent behaviors like self-correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models rely on expert demonstrations and cannot learn from failures, while RL has high sample complexity on real robots. There's a need for a method that combines VLA's capabilities with RL's self-improvement while avoiding real-world interaction costs.

Method: WMPO uses pixel-based world model predictions that align with VLA features pretrained on web-scale images, enabling on-policy GRPO (likely Generalized Reinforcement Policy Optimization) without real environment interactions.

Result: WMPO substantially improves sample efficiency, achieves stronger overall performance, exhibits emergent behaviors like self-correction, and demonstrates robust generalization and lifelong learning capabilities in both simulation and real-robot settings.

Conclusion: WMPO provides a principled framework for on-policy VLA RL that overcomes limitations of both traditional VLA models and RL methods, enabling efficient learning with emergent capabilities.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown strong potential for general-purpose robotic manipulation, but their reliance on expert demonstrations limits their ability to learn from failures and perform self-corrections. Reinforcement learning (RL) addresses these through self-improving interactions with the physical environment, but suffers from high sample complexity on real robots. We introduce World-Model-based Policy Optimization (WMPO), a principled framework for on-policy VLA RL without interacting with the real environment. In contrast to widely used latent world models, WMPO focuses on pixel-based predictions that align the "imagined" trajectories with the VLA features pretrained with web-scale images. Crucially, WMPO enables the policy to perform on-policy GRPO that provides stronger performance than the often-used off-policy methods. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-robot settings demonstrate that WMPO (i) substantially improves sample efficiency, (ii) achieves stronger overall performance, (iii) exhibits emergent behaviors such as self-correction, and (iv) demonstrates robust generalization and lifelong learning capabilities.

Method: Constructs memory library from historical demonstrations as learnable soft prompts, retrieves relevant memory through trajectory similarity matching, and dynamically integrates it into frozen VLA model for augmented action generation.

Result: Achieves up to 7.0% absolute performance gains in simulation and 25.0% on real robot evaluations for long-horizon tasks, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MAP-VLA provides a lightweight, plug-and-play solution that effectively addresses memory limitations in VLA models for long-horizon robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved remarkable success in improving robustness and generalization for end-to-end robotic manipulation. However, these models struggle with long-horizon tasks due to their lack of memory and reliance solely on immediate sensory inputs. To address this limitation, we propose Memory-Augmented Prompting for Vision-Language-Action model (MAP-VLA), a novel framework that empowers pre-trained VLA models with demonstration-derived memory prompts to augment action generation for long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks. To achieve this, MAP-VLA first constructs a memory library from historical demonstrations, where each memory unit captures information about a specific stage of a task. These memory units are implemented as learnable soft prompts optimized through prompt tuning. Then, during real-time task execution, MAP-VLA retrieves relevant memory through trajectory similarity matching and dynamically integrates it into the VLA model for augmented action generation. Importantly, this prompt tuning and retrieval augmentation approach operates as a plug-and-play module for a frozen VLA model, offering a lightweight and flexible solution to improve task performance. Experimental results show that MAP-VLA delivers up to 7.0% absolute performance gains in the simulation benchmark and 25.0% on real robot evaluations for long-horizon tasks, surpassing the current state-of-the-art methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point-based methods suffer from sparse sampling and loss of fine-grained semantics, while image-based methods have entangled semantics and geometry that are sensitive to depth noise, overlooking low-level spatial cues essential for precise interaction.

Method: Proposes a Semantic-guided Geometric Module that adaptively fuses geometry from noisy depth and semantic-guided expert priors, and a Spatial Transformer that leverages low-level spatial cues for accurate 2D-3D mapping and enables interaction among spatial features.

Result: Achieves 87.4% on RLBench and improves by 13.9% to 19.4% under varying noisy conditions. Significantly enhances few-shot generalization to new tasks and maintains robustness under various spatial perturbations.

Conclusion: SpatialActor demonstrates superior performance and robustness in robotic manipulation by explicitly disentangling semantics and geometry, making it effective for real-world applications with inherent depth noise.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation requires precise spatial understanding to interact with objects in the real world. Point-based methods suffer from sparse sampling, leading to the loss of fine-grained semantics. Image-based methods typically feed RGB and depth into 2D backbones pre-trained on 3D auxiliary tasks, but their entangled semantics and geometry are sensitive to inherent depth noise in real-world that disrupts semantic understanding. Moreover, these methods focus on high-level geometry while overlooking low-level spatial cues essential for precise interaction. We propose SpatialActor, a disentangled framework for robust robotic manipulation that explicitly decouples semantics and geometry. The Semantic-guided Geometric Module adaptively fuses two complementary geometry from noisy depth and semantic-guided expert priors. Also, a Spatial Transformer leverages low-level spatial cues for accurate 2D-3D mapping and enables interaction among spatial features. We evaluate SpatialActor on multiple simulation and real-world scenarios across 50+ tasks. It achieves state-of-the-art performance with 87.4% on RLBench and improves by 13.9% to 19.4% under varying noisy conditions, showing strong robustness. Moreover, it significantly enhances few-shot generalization to new tasks and maintains robustness under various spatial perturbations. Project Page: https://shihao1895.github.io/SpatialActor

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Combines large vision models' semantic understanding with simulation-based geometric precision for real-time 3D grasping using diffusion models on camera point clouds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision models lack geometric understanding needed for precise robotic grasping, requiring a solution that bridges semantic awareness with local geometric precision.

Method: Uses simulation with force-closure grasping generation pipeline to understand local geometries, then distills this data into a diffusion model for real-time operation on camera point clouds.

Result: Achieves high-performance semantic grasping without manually collected training data by combining global semantic understanding with geometric precision.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges the gap between semantic understanding and geometric precision for dexterous robotic grasping.

Abstract: Large Vision Models trained on internet-scale data have demonstrated strong capabilities in segmenting and semantically understanding object parts, even in cluttered, crowded scenes. However, while these models can direct a robot toward the general region of an object, they lack the geometric understanding required to precisely control dexterous robotic hands for 3D grasping. To overcome this, our key insight is to leverage simulation with a force-closure grasping generation pipeline that understands local geometries of the hand and object in the scene. Because this pipeline is slow and requires ground-truth observations, the resulting data is distilled into a diffusion model that operates in real-time on camera point clouds. By combining the global semantic understanding of internet-scale models with the geometric precision of a simulation-based locally-aware force-closure, \our achieves high-performance semantic grasping without any manually collected training data.
