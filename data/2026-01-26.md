*Xiaoyan Xing,Philipp Henzler,Junhwa Hur,Runze Li,Jonathan T. Barron,Pratul P. Srinivasan,Dor Verbin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for relighting 3D reconstructions of large room-scale environments by distilling outputs from a video-to-video relighting diffusion model into 3D reconstructions, avoiding difficult inverse rendering problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D scene relighting solutions require solving under-determined or ill-conditioned inverse rendering problems, making them unable to produce high-quality results on complex real-world scenes. Recent generative diffusion models are limited to 2D image/video relighting or 3D relighting of individual objects only.

Method: Distill outputs of a video-to-video relighting diffusion model into a 3D reconstruction, sidestepping the need to solve difficult inverse rendering problems. This creates a flexible system for controllable 3D relighting of room-scale scenes.

Result: Validated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showing the approach can faithfully render novel views of scenes under new lighting conditions.

Conclusion: The method enables controllable 3D relighting of room-scale scenes for complex real-world environments by leveraging diffusion models while avoiding traditional inverse rendering challenges.

Abstract: We present a method for relighting 3D reconstructions of large room-scale environments. Existing solutions for 3D scene relighting often require solving under-determined or ill-conditioned inverse rendering problems, and are as such unable to produce high-quality results on complex real-world scenes. Though recent progress in using generative image and video diffusion models for relighting has been promising, these techniques are either limited to 2D image and video relighting or 3D relighting of individual objects. Our approach enables controllable 3D relighting of room-scale scenes by distilling the outputs of a video-to-video relighting diffusion model into a 3D reconstruction. This side-steps the need to solve a difficult inverse rendering problem, and results in a flexible system that can relight 3D reconstructions of complex real-world scenes. We validate our approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets to show that it can faithfully render novel views of scenes under new lighting conditions.

*Dohun Lee,Chun-Hao Paul Huang,Xuelin Chen,Jong Chul Ye,Duygu Ceylan,Hyeonho Jeong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Memory-V2V introduces a memory-augmented framework for multi-turn video editing that maintains cross-consistency across sequential edits by retrieving and conditioning on prior results, with a token compressor for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video editors struggle to maintain cross-consistency across sequential edits in multi-turn video editing, where users refine results through multiple rounds of interaction.

Method: Augments existing video-to-video models with explicit memory using accurate retrieval and dynamic tokenization strategies, plus a learnable token compressor within DiT backbone to reduce redundancy and computational overhead.

Result: Achieves 30% speedup, produces significantly more cross-consistent videos with minimal computational overhead while maintaining or improving task-specific performance on video novel view synthesis and text-conditioned long video editing.

Conclusion: Memory-V2V effectively addresses cross-consistency in multi-turn video editing through memory augmentation and efficient token compression, enabling more consistent iterative editing workflows.

Abstract: Recent foundational video-to-video diffusion models have achieved impressive results in editing user provided videos by modifying appearance, motion, or camera movement. However, real-world video editing is often an iterative process, where users refine results across multiple rounds of interaction. In this multi-turn setting, current video editors struggle to maintain cross-consistency across sequential edits. In this work, we tackle, for the first time, the problem of cross-consistency in multi-turn video editing and introduce Memory-V2V, a simple, yet effective framework that augments existing video-to-video models with explicit memory. Given an external cache of previously edited videos, Memory-V2V employs accurate retrieval and dynamic tokenization strategies to condition the current editing step on prior results. To further mitigate redundancy and computational overhead, we propose a learnable token compressor within the DiT backbone that compresses redundant conditioning tokens while preserving essential visual cues, achieving an overall speedup of 30%. We validate Memory-V2V on challenging tasks including video novel view synthesis and text-conditioned long video editing. Extensive experiments show that Memory-V2V produces videos that are significantly more cross-consistent with minimal computational overhead, while maintaining or even improving task-specific performance over state-of-the-art baselines.

*Abhijeet Parida,Antonia Alomar,Zhifan Jiang,Pooneh Roshanitabrizi,Austin Tapp,Ziyue Xu,Syed Muhammad Anwar,Maria J. Ledesma-Carbayo,Holger R. Roth,Marius George Linguraru*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FeTTL is a federated learning framework that learns a global template and task model to align data distributions across medical institutions, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods on retinal fundus segmentation and histopathology classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning enables privacy-preserving collaborative training across medical centers, but domain shifts and data heterogeneity (due to variations in acquisition protocols, scanner types, and patient populations) degrade model performance in medical imaging applications.

Method: Federated Template and Task Learning (FeTTL) framework that jointly learns a global template together with a task model to align data distributions among clients in federated environments.

Result: FeTTL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art federated learning baselines (p-values <0.002) on two challenging medical imaging tasks: retinal fundus optical disc segmentation and histopathological metastasis classification from multi-institutional data.

Conclusion: FeTTL offers a principled and extensible solution for mitigating distribution shifts in federated learning, supporting robust model deployment in real-world, multi-institutional medical environments, with experiments highlighting the importance of jointly learning the template and task.

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across geographically distributed medical centers while preserving data privacy. However, domain shifts and heterogeneity in data often lead to a degradation in model performance. Medical imaging applications are particularly affected by variations in acquisition protocols, scanner types, and patient populations. To address these issues, we introduce Federated Template and Task Learning (FeTTL), a novel framework designed to harmonize multi-institutional medical imaging data in federated environments. FeTTL learns a global template together with a task model to align data distributions among clients. We evaluated FeTTL on two challenging and diverse multi-institutional medical imaging tasks: retinal fundus optical disc segmentation and histopathological metastasis classification. Experimental results show that FeTTL significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art federated learning baselines (p-values <0.002) for optical disc segmentation and classification of metastases from multi-institutional data. Our experiments further highlight the importance of jointly learning the template and the task. These findings suggest that FeTTL offers a principled and extensible solution for mitigating distribution shifts in federated learning, supporting robust model deployment in real-world, multi-institutional environments.

### [4] [Where is the multimodal goal post? On the Ability of Foundation Models to Recognize Contextually Important Moments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16333)
*Aditya K Surikuchi,Raquel Fernández,Sandro Pezzelle*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Models struggle to identify important sub-events in football videos, performing near chance level despite using state-of-the-art multimodal architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models are widely used for language generation from temporally-ordered multimodal events, but their ability to identify important sub-events - a fundamental prerequisite for narration and summarization - remains unclear, especially in complex domains like football games.

Method: Created a new dataset using human preferences implicit in football highlight reels (no additional annotation costs), evaluated several state-of-the-art multimodal models on distinguishing important vs. non-important sub-events, and conducted analyses beyond standard metrics.

Result: Models perform near chance level, tend to rely on a single dominant modality, and are ineffective at synthesizing information from multiple sources. The dataset will be publicly released.

Conclusion: Need modular architectures to handle sample-level heterogeneity in multimodal data and complementary training procedures to maximize cross-modal synergy for effective event importance identification.

Abstract: Foundation models are used for many real-world applications involving language generation from temporally-ordered multimodal events. In this work, we study the ability of models to identify the most important sub-events in a video, which is a fundamental prerequisite for narrating or summarizing multimodal events. Specifically, we focus on football games and evaluate models on their ability to distinguish between important and non-important sub-events in a game. To this end, we construct a new dataset by leveraging human preferences for importance implicit in football game highlight reels, without any additional annotation costs. Using our dataset, which we will publicly release to the community, we compare several state-of-the-art multimodal models and show that they are not far from chance level performance. Analyses of models beyond standard evaluation metrics reveal their tendency to rely on a single dominant modality and their ineffectiveness in synthesizing necessary information from multiple sources. Our findings underline the importance of modular architectures that can handle sample-level heterogeneity in multimodal data and the need for complementary training procedures that can maximize cross-modal synergy.

### [5] [Coarse-to-Fine Non-rigid Multi-modal Image Registration for Historical Panel Paintings based on Crack Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16348)
*Aline Sindel,Andreas Maier,Vincent Christlein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A coarse-to-fine non-rigid multi-modal registration method using craquelure patterns and neural networks for aligning historical panel painting images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual pixel-wise alignment of multi-modal images (visual light, infrared, UV, x-ray, macro) for historical panel paintings is laborious and imprecise. Automated registration is needed to handle varying resolutions, huge sizes, non-rigid distortions, and modality-dependent content.

Method: One-stage non-rigid registration using CNN for joint keypoint detection/description based on craquelure patterns, GNN for patch-based descriptor matching, homography reprojection error filtering, and novel multi-level keypoint refinement for mixed-resolution images up to highest resolution.

Result: Created multi-modal dataset with keypoint annotations and large test set across five domains. Ablation study validates all refinement modules. Proposed method achieves best registration results compared to competing keypoint/dense matching and refinement methods.

Conclusion: The method successfully addresses challenges in multi-modal registration of historical paintings using craquelure features and neural networks, outperforming existing approaches and enabling efficient, precise alignment of large, mixed-resolution images.

Abstract: Art technological investigations of historical panel paintings rely on acquiring multi-modal image data, including visual light photography, infrared reflectography, ultraviolet fluorescence photography, x-radiography, and macro photography. For a comprehensive analysis, the multi-modal images require pixel-wise alignment, which is still often performed manually. Multi-modal image registration can reduce this laborious manual work, is substantially faster, and enables higher precision. Due to varying image resolutions, huge image sizes, non-rigid distortions, and modality-dependent image content, registration is challenging. Therefore, we propose a coarse-to-fine non-rigid multi-modal registration method efficiently relying on sparse keypoints and thin-plate-splines. Historical paintings exhibit a fine crack pattern, called craquelure, on the paint layer, which is captured by all image systems and is well-suited as a feature for registration. In our one-stage non-rigid registration approach, we employ a convolutional neural network for joint keypoint detection and description based on the craquelure and a graph neural network for descriptor matching in a patch-based manner, and filter matches based on homography reprojection errors in local areas. For coarse-to-fine registration, we introduce a novel multi-level keypoint refinement approach to register mixed-resolution images up to the highest resolution. We created a multi-modal dataset of panel paintings with a high number of keypoint annotations, and a large test set comprising five multi-modal domains and varying image resolutions. The ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of all modules of our refinement method. Our proposed approaches achieve the best registration results compared to competing keypoint and dense matching methods and refinement methods.

### [6] [Cognitively-Inspired Tokens Overcome Egocentric Bias in Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16378)
*Bridget Leonard,Scott O. Murray*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Perspective tokens - specialized embeddings encoding orientation through body-keypoint cues or abstract representations - improve multimodal language models' spatial reasoning and perspective-taking abilities, addressing their persistent egocentric bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal language models perform well on semantic vision-language tasks but fail at spatial reasoning requiring adoption of another agent's visual perspective, showing persistent egocentric bias and lacking allocentric reasoning capabilities.

Method: Introduce perspective tokens - specialized embeddings that encode orientation through either (1) embodied body-keypoint cues or (2) abstract representations supporting mental rotation. Integrate these tokens into LLaVA-1.5-13B model architecture.

Result: Perspective tokens improve accuracy on level-2 visual perspective-taking tasks across synthetic and naturalistic benchmarks (Isle Bricks V2, COCO, 3DSRBench). Rotation-based tokens generalize to non-human reference agents. Fine-tuning enhances latent orientation sensitivity already present in base models.

Conclusion: Embedding cognitively grounded spatial structure directly into token space provides a lightweight, model-agnostic mechanism for perspective-taking and more human-like spatial reasoning. MLMs contain precursors of allocentric reasoning but lack appropriate internal structure.

Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLMs) perform well on semantic vision-language tasks but fail at spatial reasoning that requires adopting another agent's visual perspective. These errors reflect a persistent egocentric bias and raise questions about whether current models support allocentric reasoning. Inspired by human spatial cognition, we introduce perspective tokens, specialized embeddings that encode orientation through either (1) embodied body-keypoint cues or (2) abstract representations supporting mental rotation. Integrating these tokens into LLaVA-1.5-13B yields performance on level-2 visual perspective-taking tasks. Across synthetic and naturalistic benchmarks (Isle Bricks V2, COCO, 3DSRBench), perspective tokens improve accuracy, with rotation-based tokens generalizing to non-human reference agents. Representational analyses reveal that fine-tuning enhances latent orientation sensitivity already present in the base model, suggesting that MLMs contain precursors of allocentric reasoning but lack appropriate internal structure. Overall, embedding cognitively grounded spatial structure directly into token space provides a lightweight, model-agnostic mechanism for perspective-taking and more human-like spatial reasoning.

### [7] [VTFusion: A Vision-Text Multimodal Fusion Network for Few-Shot Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16381)
*Yuxin Jiang,Yunkang Cao,Yuqi Cheng,Yiheng Zhang,Weiming Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VTFusion is a vision-text multimodal framework for Few-Shot Anomaly Detection that addresses domain gaps and semantic misalignment between modalities through adaptive feature extractors and dedicated fusion modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FSAD methods rely on pre-trained natural scene features that neglect domain-specific industrial semantics, and use superficial fusion strategies that fail to address semantic misalignment between visual and textual modalities, compromising robustness.

Method: Two core designs: 1) Adaptive feature extractors for both image and text to learn task-specific representations and bridge domain gaps, augmented with synthetic anomaly generation; 2) Multimodal prediction fusion module with cross-modal information exchange and segmentation network for refined pixel-level anomaly maps.

Result: Achieved image-level AUROCs of 96.8% and 86.2% in 2-shot scenario on MVTec AD and VisA datasets, and AUPRO of 93.5% on real-world industrial automotive plastic parts dataset, demonstrating superior performance and practical applicability.

Conclusion: VTFusion significantly advances FSAD performance by effectively addressing domain gaps and semantic misalignment through adaptive multimodal fusion, proving practical for demanding industrial inspection scenarios.

Abstract: Few-Shot Anomaly Detection (FSAD) has emerged as a critical paradigm for identifying irregularities using scarce normal references. While recent methods have integrated textual semantics to complement visual data, they predominantly rely on features pre-trained on natural scenes, thereby neglecting the granular, domain-specific semantics essential for industrial inspection. Furthermore, prevalent fusion strategies often resort to superficial concatenation, failing to address the inherent semantic misalignment between visual and textual modalities, which compromises robustness against cross-modal interference. To bridge these gaps, this study proposes VTFusion, a vision-text multimodal fusion framework tailored for FSAD. The framework rests on two core designs. First, adaptive feature extractors for both image and text modalities are introduced to learn task-specific representations, bridging the domain gap between pre-trained models and industrial data; this is further augmented by generating diverse synthetic anomalies to enhance feature discriminability. Second, a dedicated multimodal prediction fusion module is developed, comprising a fusion block that facilitates rich cross-modal information exchange and a segmentation network that generates refined pixel-level anomaly maps under multimodal guidance. VTFusion significantly advances FSAD performance, achieving image-level AUROCs of 96.8% and 86.2% in the 2-shot scenario on the MVTec AD and VisA datasets, respectively. Furthermore, VTFusion achieves an AUPRO of 93.5% on a real-world dataset of industrial automotive plastic parts introduced in this paper, further demonstrating its practical applicability in demanding industrial scenarios.

### [8] [ResAgent: Entropy-based Prior Point Discovery and Visual Reasoning for Referring Expression Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16394)
*Yihao Wang,Jusheng Zhang,Ziyi Tang,Keze Wang,Meng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RES framework with entropy-based point discovery and vision-based reasoning achieves SOTA on four benchmarks by addressing MLLM limitations in point prompt selection and coordinate reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RES methods suffer from two key limitations: (1) coarse bounding boxes from MLLMs lead to redundant/non-discriminative point prompts, and (2) textual coordinate reasoning is unreliable for distinguishing targets from visually similar distractors.

Method: Proposes \model with two components: Entropy-Based Point Discovery (EBD) identifies high-information candidate points via spatial uncertainty modeling, and Vision-Based Reasoning (VBR) verifies point correctness through joint visual-semantic alignment. Implements coarse-to-fine workflow: bounding box initialization → entropy-guided point discovery → vision-based validation → mask decoding.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art performance across all four benchmark datasets (RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and ReasonSeg), demonstrating effectiveness in generating accurate and semantically grounded segmentation masks with minimal prompts.

Conclusion: \model effectively addresses limitations of existing RES methods by integrating entropy-based point discovery and vision-based reasoning, enabling more reliable and accurate referring expression segmentation through better point prompt selection and validation mechanisms.

Abstract: Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) is a core vision-language segmentation task that enables pixel-level understanding of targets via free-form linguistic expressions, supporting critical applications such as human-robot interaction and augmented reality. Despite the progress of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based approaches, existing RES methods still suffer from two key limitations: first, the coarse bounding boxes from MLLMs lead to redundant or non-discriminative point prompts; second, the prevalent reliance on textual coordinate reasoning is unreliable, as it fails to distinguish targets from visually similar distractors. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{\model}, a novel RES framework integrating \textbf{E}ntropy-\textbf{B}ased Point \textbf{D}iscovery (\textbf{EBD}) and \textbf{V}ision-\textbf{B}ased \textbf{R}easoning (\textbf{VBR}). Specifically, EBD identifies high-information candidate points by modeling spatial uncertainty within coarse bounding boxes, treating point selection as an information maximization process. VBR verifies point correctness through joint visual-semantic alignment, abandoning text-only coordinate inference for more robust validation. Built on these components, \model implements a coarse-to-fine workflow: bounding box initialization, entropy-guided point discovery, vision-based validation, and mask decoding. Extensive evaluations on four benchmark datasets (RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and ReasonSeg) demonstrate that \model achieves new state-of-the-art performance across all four benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in generating accurate and semantically grounded segmentation masks with minimal prompts.

### [9] [A Cosine Network for Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16413)
*Chunwei Tian,Chengyuan Zhang,Bob Zhang,Zhiwu Li,C. L. Philip Chen,David Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CSRNet improves image super-resolution by designing odd/even heterogeneous blocks to extract complementary structural information and using cosine annealing for training optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While deep CNNs can extract hierarchical structural information for image super-resolution, preserving the effectiveness of this structural information is crucial. Current methods may suffer from homologous information limitations and training optimization challenges.

Method: Proposes CSRNet with: 1) Odd and even heterogeneous blocks to extract complementary homologous structural information by enlarging architectural differences, 2) Combination of linear and non-linear structural information to enhance robustness, 3) Cosine annealing mechanism with warm restarts to optimize training and avoid local minima.

Result: Experimental results show that CSRNet is competitive with state-of-the-art methods in image super-resolution tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed CSRNet effectively addresses structural information preservation in image super-resolution through architectural innovations and training optimization, achieving competitive performance with existing methods.

Abstract: Deep convolutional neural networks can use hierarchical information to progressively extract structural information to recover high-quality images. However, preserving the effectiveness of the obtained structural information is important in image super-resolution. In this paper, we propose a cosine network for image super-resolution (CSRNet) by improving a network architecture and optimizing the training strategy. To extract complementary homologous structural information, odd and even heterogeneous blocks are designed to enlarge the architectural differences and improve the performance of image super-resolution. Combining linear and non-linear structural information can overcome the drawback of homologous information and enhance the robustness of the obtained structural information in image super-resolution. Taking into account the local minimum of gradient descent, a cosine annealing mechanism is used to optimize the training procedure by performing warm restarts and adjusting the learning rate. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed CSRNet is competitive with state-of-the-art methods in image super-resolution.

### [10] [DCCS-Det: Directional Context and Cross-Scale-Aware Detector for Infrared Small Target](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16428)
*Shuying Li,Qiang Ma,San Zhang,Chuang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCCS-Det is a new infrared small target detector that uses dual-stream saliency enhancement and latent-aware semantic extraction to better capture local-global features and reduce feature degradation, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing infrared small target detection methods suffer from inadequate joint modeling of local-global features (hurting target-background discrimination) and feature redundancy/semantic dilution (degrading target representation quality).

Method: Proposes DCCS-Det with two key components: 1) Dual-stream Saliency Enhancement (DSE) block that integrates localized perception with direction-aware context aggregation, and 2) Latent-aware Semantic Extraction and Aggregation (LaSEA) module that uses cross-scale feature extraction and random pooling sampling to mitigate feature degradation.

Result: Extensive experiments show DCCS-Det achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy with competitive efficiency across multiple datasets. Ablation studies validate the contributions of DSE and LaSEA in improving target perception and feature representation.

Conclusion: DCCS-Det effectively addresses the limitations of existing infrared small target detection methods through its novel architectural components, demonstrating superior performance in complex scenarios while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is critical for applications like remote sensing and surveillance, which aims to identify small, low-contrast targets against complex backgrounds. However, existing methods often struggle with inadequate joint modeling of local-global features (harming target-background discrimination) or feature redundancy and semantic dilution (degrading target representation quality). To tackle these issues, we propose DCCS-Det (Directional Context and Cross-Scale Aware Detector for Infrared Small Target), a novel detector that incorporates a Dual-stream Saliency Enhancement (DSE) block and a Latent-aware Semantic Extraction and Aggregation (LaSEA) module. The DSE block integrates localized perception with direction-aware context aggregation to help capture long-range spatial dependencies and local details. On this basis, the LaSEA module mitigates feature degradation via cross-scale feature extraction and random pooling sampling strategies, enhancing discriminative features and suppressing noise. Extensive experiments show that DCCS-Det achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy with competitive efficiency across multiple datasets. Ablation studies further validate the contributions of DSE and LaSEA in improving target perception and feature representation under complex scenarios. \href{https://huggingface.co/InPeerReview/InfraredSmallTargetDetection-IRSTD.DCCS}{DCCS-Det Official Code is Available Here!}

*Jongmin Yu,Hyeontaek Oh,Zhongtian Sun,Angelica I Aviles-Rivero,Moongu Jeon,Jinhong Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AlphaFace improves face-swapping robustness for extreme poses using vision-language model embeddings and contrastive losses while maintaining real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing face-swapping methods degrade with extreme facial poses, geometric features add complexity, and diffusion methods are too slow for real-time use.

Method: Uses open-source vision-language model with CLIP embeddings and novel visual/textual semantic contrastive losses for better identity representation and attribute preservation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on FF++, MPIE, and LPFF datasets, especially in pose-challenging cases, while maintaining real-time performance.

Conclusion: AlphaFace achieves superior face-swapping quality for extreme poses through semantic contrastive learning without sacrificing real-time processing capability.

Abstract: Existing face-swapping methods often deliver competitive results in constrained settings but exhibit substantial quality degradation when handling extreme facial poses. To improve facial pose robustness, explicit geometric features are applied, but this approach remains problematic since it introduces additional dependencies and increases computational cost. Diffusion-based methods have achieved remarkable results; however, they are impractical for real-time processing. We introduce AlphaFace, which leverages an open-source vision-language model and CLIP image and text embeddings to apply novel visual and textual semantic contrastive losses. AlphaFace enables stronger identity representation and more precise attribute preservation, all while maintaining real-time performance. Comprehensive experiments across FF++, MPIE, and LPFF demonstrate that AlphaFace surpasses state-of-the-art methods in pose-challenging cases. The project is publicly available on `https://github.com/andrewyu90/Alphaface_Official.git'.

*Shuying Li,Qiang Ma,San Zhang,Wuwei Wang,Chuang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MDAFNet improves infrared small target detection by addressing edge degradation and frequency interference issues through multi-scale edge enhancement and adaptive frequency processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IRSTD methods suffer from gradual degradation of target edge pixels as network depth increases, and traditional convolution struggles to differentiate frequency components, causing low-frequency backgrounds to interfere with high-frequency targets and high-frequency noise to trigger false detections.

Method: Proposes MDAFNet with two key modules: 1) Multi-Scale Differential Edge (MSDE) module for edge extraction and enhancement to compensate for edge information loss during downsampling, and 2) Dual-Domain Adaptive Feature Enhancement (DAFE) module that combines frequency domain processing with simulated frequency decomposition/fusion in spatial domain to adaptively enhance high-frequency targets while suppressing noise.

Result: Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate superior detection performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: MDAFNet effectively addresses edge degradation and frequency interference problems in infrared small target detection through its innovative multi-scale edge enhancement and adaptive frequency processing approach.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) plays a crucial role in numerous military and civilian applications. However, existing methods often face the gradual degradation of target edge pixels as the number of network layers increases, and traditional convolution struggles to differentiate between frequency components during feature extraction, leading to low-frequency backgrounds interfering with high-frequency targets and high-frequency noise triggering false detections. To address these limitations, we propose MDAFNet (Multi-scale Differential Edge and Adaptive Frequency Guided Network for Infrared Small Target Detection), which integrates the Multi-Scale Differential Edge (MSDE) module and Dual-Domain Adaptive Feature Enhancement (DAFE) module. The MSDE module, through a multi-scale edge extraction and enhancement mechanism, effectively compensates for the cumulative loss of target edge information during downsampling. The DAFE module combines frequency domain processing mechanisms with simulated frequency decomposition and fusion mechanisms in the spatial domain to effectively improve the network's capability to adaptively enhance high-frequency targets and selectively suppress high-frequency noise. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the superior detection performance of MDAFNet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In the post-pandemic era, high mask usage during civil aviation security checks creates significant challenges for traditional face recognition models, necessitating evaluation of backbone networks' performance under masked conditions.

Method: Conducted extensive comparative experiments evaluating several core backbone networks (r100 series, r50, r34_mask_v1, r100_mask_v2, r50_mask_v3, Vit-Small/Tiny) in both standard and masked test scenarios.

Result: In standard tests: r100 series excelled (98%+ accuracy at 0.01% FAR), r50 ranked second, r34_mask_v1 lagged. In masked tests: r100_mask_v2 led (90.07% accuracy), r50_mask_v3 performed best among r50 but trailed r100, Vit-Small/Tiny showed strong masked performance with effectiveness gains.

Conclusion: The comprehensive evaluation reveals differential impacts of backbone networks on face recognition with/without masks, providing specific deployment recommendations for post-pandemic security scenarios where mask usage is prevalent.

Abstract: Erratum to the paper (Zhang et al., 2025): corrections to Table IV and the data in Page 3, Section A. In the post-pandemic era, a high proportion of civil aviation passengers wear masks during security checks, posing significant challenges to traditional face recognition models. The backbone network serves as the core component of face recognition models. In standard tests, r100 series models excelled (98%+ accuracy at 0.01% FAR in face comparison, high top1/top5 in search). r50 ranked second, r34_mask_v1 lagged. In masked tests, r100_mask_v2 led (90.07% accuracy), r50_mask_v3 performed best among r50 but trailed r100. Vit-Small/Tiny showed strong masked performance with gains in effectiveness. Through extensive comparative experiments, this paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of several core backbone networks, aiming to reveal the impacts of different models on face recognition with and without masks, and provide specific deployment recommendations.

*Yangfan Xu,Lilian Zhang,Xiaofeng He,Pengdong Wu,Wenqi Wu,Jun Mao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised training framework for Visual Geometry Grounded Transformers (VGGT) that eliminates need for ground truth labels by using sequence-wise geometric constraints and photometric consistency losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VGGT models for camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction require ground truth labels for training, making them difficult to adapt to unlabeled and unseen scenes in large-scale environments.

Method: Extends pair-wise relations to sequence-wise geometric constraints by sampling multiple source frames and geometrically projecting them onto different target frames. Uses joint optimization loss combining physical photometric consistency and geometric constraints instead of hard labels.

Result: Model converges within hundreds of iterations and achieves significant improvements in large-scale localization. Both attention layers and camera/depth heads effectively capture multi-view geometry without supervision.

Conclusion: Proposed self-supervised framework enables effective training of VGGT models on unlabeled data, enhancing their localization capability in large-scale environments without requiring ground truth annotations.

Abstract: Transformer-based general visual geometry frameworks have shown promising performance in camera pose estimation and 3D scene understanding. Recent advancements in Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) models have shown great promise in camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. However, these models typically rely on ground truth labels for training, posing challenges when adapting to unlabeled and unseen scenes. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised framework to train VGGT with unlabeled data, thereby enhancing its localization capability in large-scale environments. To achieve this, we extend conventional pair-wise relations to sequence-wise geometric constraints for self-supervised learning. Specifically, in each sequence, we sample multiple source frames and geometrically project them onto different target frames, which improves temporal feature consistency. We formulate physical photometric consistency and geometric constraints as a joint optimization loss to circumvent the requirement for hard labels. By training the model with this proposed method, not only the local and global cross-view attention layers but also the camera and depth heads can effectively capture the underlying multi-view geometry. Experiments demonstrate that the model converges within hundreds of iterations and achieves significant improvements in large-scale localization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Emotion-LLaMAv2 improves multimodal emotion reasoning with end-to-end multiview encoding, Conv Attention pre-fusion, and curriculum instruction tuning, supported by the large-scale MMEVerse benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs have limited emotional reasoning capabilities due to scarce high-quality emotion datasets, lack of standardized benchmarks, and limitations in previous frameworks like explicit face detectors and implicit fusion strategies.

Method: Three key advances: 1) End-to-end multiview encoder eliminating face detection, 2) Conv Attention pre-fusion module for local/global multimodal interactions, 3) Perception-to-cognition curriculum instruction tuning within LLaMA2 backbone.

Result: Created MMEVerse benchmark aggregating 12 emotion datasets (IEMOCAP, MELD, DFEW, MAFW) with 130k training clips and 36k testing clips across 18 evaluation benchmarks, re-annotated via multi-agent pipeline.

Conclusion: Establishes comprehensive end-to-end pipeline and standardized evaluation for emotion recognition and reasoning, addressing previous limitations in multimodal emotion understanding.

Abstract: Understanding human emotions from multimodal signals poses a significant challenge in affective computing and human-robot interaction. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have excelled in general vision-language tasks, their capabilities in emotional reasoning remain limited. The field currently suffers from a scarcity of large-scale datasets with high-quality, descriptive emotion annotations and lacks standardized benchmarks for evaluation. Our preliminary framework, Emotion-LLaMA, pioneered instruction-tuned multimodal learning for emotion reasoning but was restricted by explicit face detectors, implicit fusion strategies, and low-quality training data with limited scale. To address these limitations, we present Emotion-LLaMAv2 and the MMEVerse benchmark, establishing an end-to-end pipeline together with a standardized evaluation setting for emotion recognition and reasoning. Emotion-LLaMAv2 introduces three key advances. First, an end-to-end multiview encoder eliminates external face detection and captures nuanced emotional cues via richer spatial and temporal multiview tokens. Second, a Conv Attention pre-fusion module is designed to enable simultaneous local and global multimodal feature interactions external to the LLM backbone. Third, a perception-to-cognition curriculum instruction tuning scheme within the LLaMA2 backbone unifies emotion recognition and free-form emotion reasoning. To support large-scale training and reproducible evaluation, MMEVerse aggregates twelve publicly available emotion datasets, including IEMOCAP, MELD, DFEW, and MAFW, into a unified multimodal instruction format. The data are re-annotated via a multi-agent pipeline involving Qwen2 Audio, Qwen2.5 VL, and GPT 4o, producing 130k training clips and 36k testing clips across 18 evaluation benchmarks.

TL;DR: AnyView is a diffusion-based video generation framework for dynamic view synthesis that uses multi-source training data (2D, 3D, 4D) to create spatiotemporal representations capable of zero-shot novel video generation from arbitrary camera trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative video models struggle with maintaining multi-view and spatiotemporal consistency in highly dynamic real-world environments, especially when viewpoints have minimal overlap.

Method: A diffusion-based framework trained on multiple data sources with varying supervision levels (monocular 2D, multi-view static 3D, and multi-view dynamic 4D datasets) to learn a generalist spatiotemporal implicit representation.

Result: Competitive performance on standard benchmarks and superior performance on the new AnyViewBench for extreme dynamic view synthesis, maintaining realistic and consistent videos from any viewpoint while baselines degrade significantly.

Conclusion: AnyView demonstrates robust dynamic view synthesis capabilities with minimal geometric assumptions, outperforming existing methods in challenging real-world scenarios with extreme viewpoint changes.

Abstract: Modern generative video models excel at producing convincing, high-quality outputs, but struggle to maintain multi-view and spatiotemporal consistency in highly dynamic real-world environments. In this work, we introduce \textbf{AnyView}, a diffusion-based video generation framework for \emph{dynamic view synthesis} with minimal inductive biases or geometric assumptions. We leverage multiple data sources with various levels of supervision, including monocular (2D), multi-view static (3D) and multi-view dynamic (4D) datasets, to train a generalist spatiotemporal implicit representation capable of producing zero-shot novel videos from arbitrary camera locations and trajectories. We evaluate AnyView on standard benchmarks, showing competitive results with the current state of the art, and propose \textbf{AnyViewBench}, a challenging new benchmark tailored towards \emph{extreme} dynamic view synthesis in diverse real-world scenarios. In this more dramatic setting, we find that most baselines drastically degrade in performance, as they require significant overlap between viewpoints, while AnyView maintains the ability to produce realistic, plausible, and spatiotemporally consistent videos when prompted from \emph{any} viewpoint.

TL;DR: VISTA-PATH is an interactive pathology segmentation foundation model that combines visual context, semantic descriptions, and expert prompts for precise multi-class segmentation, outperforming existing models and enabling clinically meaningful tissue analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current segmentation foundation models treat segmentation as static visual prediction and are poorly aligned with pathology needs, lacking the ability to handle heterogeneous structures, incorporate expert feedback, and produce clinically meaningful pixel-level segmentation.

Method: VISTA-PATH jointly conditions segmentation on visual context, semantic tissue descriptions, and optional expert spatial prompts. It uses a large-scale pathology segmentation corpus (VISTA-PATH Data) with 1.6M image-mask-text triplets across 9 organs and 93 tissue classes, and supports human-in-the-loop refinement through sparse bounding-box annotation propagation.

Result: VISTA-PATH consistently outperforms existing segmentation foundation models on held-out and external benchmarks. It enables Tumor Interaction Score (TIS) computation that shows strong associations with patient survival, making it a preferred model for computational pathology.

Conclusion: VISTA-PATH elevates pathology segmentation from static prediction to interactive, clinically grounded representation, establishing a new foundation model paradigm for digital pathology that integrates expert feedback and produces clinically meaningful tissue analysis.

Abstract: Accurate semantic segmentation for histopathology image is crucial for quantitative tissue analysis and downstream clinical modeling. Recent segmentation foundation models have improved generalization through large-scale pretraining, yet remain poorly aligned with pathology because they treat segmentation as a static visual prediction task. Here we present VISTA-PATH, an interactive, class-aware pathology segmentation foundation model designed to resolve heterogeneous structures, incorporate expert feedback, and produce pixel-level segmentation that are directly meaningful for clinical interpretation. VISTA-PATH jointly conditions segmentation on visual context, semantic tissue descriptions, and optional expert-provided spatial prompts, enabling precise multi-class segmentation across heterogeneous pathology images. To support this paradigm, we curate VISTA-PATH Data, a large-scale pathology segmentation corpus comprising over 1.6 million image-mask-text triplets spanning 9 organs and 93 tissue classes. Across extensive held-out and external benchmarks, VISTA-PATH consistently outperforms existing segmentation foundation models. Importantly, VISTA-PATH supports dynamic human-in-the-loop refinement by propagating sparse, patch-level bounding-box annotation feedback into whole-slide segmentation. Finally, we show that the high-fidelity, class-aware segmentation produced by VISTA-PATH is a preferred model for computational pathology. It improve tissue microenvironment analysis through proposed Tumor Interaction Score (TIS), which exhibits strong and significant associations with patient survival. Together, these results establish VISTA-PATH as a foundation model that elevates pathology image segmentation from a static prediction to an interactive and clinically grounded representation for digital pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using gameplay video glitches (visual anomalies violating physics) as scalable supervision for physical reasoning, creating PhysGame dataset and GameBench benchmark to enhance multimodal models' physical understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack human-level physical understanding, and existing datasets are either expensive (real videos) or unrealistic (synthetic). Gameplay glitches offer rich, scalable supervision for physical reasoning.

Method: Proposed using gameplay video glitches as supervision source. Created PhysGame dataset (140K QA pairs across 5 domains) using metadata-guided prompting, and GameBench benchmark (880 expert-annotated videos) for evaluation.

Result: PhysGame improved Qwen2.5VL by 2.5% on real-world PhysBench, 1.9% on general MVBench, and 3.7% on GameBench for glitch detection. Shows effective Game2Real and Game2General transferability.

Conclusion: Learning from gameplay anomalies provides scalable, effective pathway for advancing physical world understanding in multimodal intelligence, with demonstrated transferability to real-world and general reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Understanding the physical world, including object dynamics, material properties, and causal interactions, remains a core challenge in artificial intelligence. Although recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive general reasoning capabilities, they still fall short of achieving human-level understanding of physical principles. Existing datasets for physical reasoning either rely on real-world videos, which incur high annotation costs, or on synthetic simulations, which suffer from limited realism and diversity. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm that leverages glitches in gameplay videos, referring to visual anomalies that violate predefined physical laws, as a rich and scalable supervision source for physical world understanding. We introduce PhysGame, an meta information guided instruction-tuning dataset containing 140,057 glitch-centric question-answer pairs across five physical domains and sixteen fine-grained categories. To ensure data accuracy, we design a prompting strategy that utilizes gameplay metadata such as titles and descriptions to guide high-quality QA generation. Complementing PhysGame, we construct GameBench, an expert-annotated benchmark with 880 glitch-identified gameplay videos designed to evaluate physical reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments show that PhysGame significantly enhances both Game2Real transferability, improving the real world physical reasoning performance of Qwen2.5VL by 2.5% on PhysBench, and Game2General transferability, yielding a 1.9% gain on the MVBench benchmark. Moreover, PhysGame-tuned models achieve a 3.7% absolute improvement on GameBench, demonstrating enhanced robustness in detecting physical implausibilities. These results indicate that learning from gameplay anomalies offers a scalable and effective pathway toward advancing physical world understanding in multimodal intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wound care faces economic and logistical challenges worldwide. While computer vision and machine learning have helped with wound segmentation from RGB images, existing 2D approaches lack the completeness and precision needed for accurate healing progress tracking. The key challenge is inferring multi-view consistent 3D structures from 2D images.

Method: WoundNeRF, a NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) SDF (Signed Distance Function)-based method that estimates robust wound segmentations from automatically generated annotations. This approach leverages neural implicit representations to create 3D reconstructions from 2D images.

Result: The method demonstrates potential in recovering accurate segmentations, outperforming state-of-the-art Vision Transformer networks and conventional rasterisation-based algorithms in comparative evaluation.

Conclusion: WoundNeRF represents a promising paradigm for 3D wound segmentation from 2D images, enabling more complete and precise healing progress tracking. The code will be released to facilitate further development in this area.

Abstract: Wound care is often challenged by the economic and logistical burdens that consistently afflict patients and hospitals worldwide. In recent decades, healthcare professionals have sought support from computer vision and machine learning algorithms. In particular, wound segmentation has gained interest due to its ability to provide professionals with fast, automatic tissue assessment from standard RGB images. Some approaches have extended segmentation to 3D, enabling more complete and precise healing progress tracking. However, inferring multi-view consistent 3D structures from 2D images remains a challenge. In this paper, we evaluate WoundNeRF, a NeRF SDF-based method for estimating robust wound segmentations from automatically generated annotations. We demonstrate the potential of this paradigm in recovering accurate segmentations by comparing it against state-of-the-art Vision Transformer networks and conventional rasterisation-based algorithms. The code will be released to facilitate further development in this promising paradigm.

TL;DR: EKDC-Net: Expert Knowledge-Guided Decision Calibration Network for fine-grained tree species classification, addressing long-tailed distributions and high inter-class similarity with lightweight plug-and-play modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on complex architectures but overlook long-tailed distributions and high inter-class similarity in limited data, struggling with few-shot or confusing categories. Inspired by human knowledge dissemination where individuals seek expert assistance, the authors aim to overcome these limitations.

Method: Proposes EKDC-Net with two core modules: 1) Local Prior Guided Knowledge Extraction Module (LPKEM) using CAM analysis to guide domain expert focus on discriminative features, and 2) Uncertainty-Guided Decision Calibration Module (UDCM) that dynamically corrects local model decisions based on category and instance-level uncertainty. Also introduces CU-Tree102 dataset with 102 tree species.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets. As a lightweight plug-and-play module, improves backbone accuracy by 6.42% and precision by 11.46% using only 0.08M additional parameters.

Conclusion: EKDC-Net effectively addresses long-tailed distribution and inter-class similarity challenges in fine-grained tree species classification through expert knowledge guidance and uncertainty-based decision calibration, while being computationally efficient.

Abstract: Accurate fine-grained tree species classification is critical for forest inventory and biodiversity monitoring. Existing methods predominantly focus on designing complex architectures to fit local data distributions. However, they often overlook the long-tailed distributions and high inter-class similarity inherent in limited data, thereby struggling to distinguish between few-shot or confusing categories. In the process of knowledge dissemination in the human world, individuals will actively seek expert assistance to transcend the limitations of local thinking. Inspired by this, we introduce an external "Domain Expert" and propose an Expert Knowledge-Guided Classification Decision Calibration Network (EKDC-Net) to overcome these challenges. Our framework addresses two core issues: expert knowledge extraction and utilization. Specifically, we first develop a Local Prior Guided Knowledge Extraction Module (LPKEM). By leveraging Class Activation Map (CAM) analysis, LPKEM guides the domain expert to focus exclusively on discriminative features essential for classification. Subsequently, to effectively integrate this knowledge, we design an Uncertainty-Guided Decision Calibration Module (UDCM). This module dynamically corrects the local model's decisions by considering both overall category uncertainty and instance-level prediction uncertainty. Furthermore, we present a large-scale classification dataset covering 102 tree species, named CU-Tree102 to address the issue of scarce diversity in current benchmarks. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. Crucially, as a lightweight plug-and-play module, EKDC-Net improves backbone accuracy by 6.42% and precision by 11.46% using only 0.08M additional learnable parameters. The dataset, code, and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/WHU-USI3DV/TreeCLS.

TL;DR: SALAD introduces a lightweight linear attention branch with input-dependent gating to achieve 90% sparsity and 1.72x inference speedup for Diffusion Transformers in video generation while maintaining quality comparable to full attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers for video generation suffer from high computational latency due to quadratic complexity of full attention. Existing sparse attention methods either offer limited acceleration (training-free) or require substantial data/computation (training-based).

Method: SALAD adds a lightweight linear attention branch parallel to sparse attention with input-dependent gating mechanism to balance both branches, achieving high sparsity while maintaining quality.

Result: Achieves 90% sparsity and 1.72x inference speedup while maintaining generation quality comparable to full attention baseline. Finetuning requires only 2,000 video samples and 1,600 training steps with batch size 8.

Conclusion: SALAD provides an efficient solution for accelerating Diffusion Transformers in video generation with minimal training requirements, balancing computational efficiency and generation quality.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers have recently demonstrated remarkable performance in video generation. However, the long input sequences result in high computational latency due to the quadratic complexity of full attention. Various sparse attention mechanisms have been proposed. Training-free sparse attention is constrained by limited sparsity and thus offers modest acceleration, whereas training-based methods can reach much higher sparsity but demand substantial data and computation for training. In this work, we propose SALAD, introducing a lightweight linear attention branch in parallel with the sparse attention. By incorporating an input-dependent gating mechanism to finely balance the two branches, our method attains 90% sparsity and 1.72x inference speedup, while maintaining generation quality comparable to the full attention baseline. Moreover, our finetuning process is highly efficient, requiring only 2,000 video samples and 1,600 training steps with a batch size of 8.

TL;DR: TangramPuzzle benchmark evaluates MLLMs' compositional spatial reasoning using Tangram game geometry, revealing models prioritize silhouette matching over geometric constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack rigorous evaluation for precise compositional spatial reasoning, with existing benchmarks using simple tasks, semantic approximations, and coarse positioning without mathematical rigor.

Method: Introduces TangramPuzzle benchmark with Tangram Construction Expression (TCE) - a symbolic geometric framework for exact coordinate specifications. Designs two tasks: Outline Prediction (infer global shapes from local components) and End-to-End Code Generation (solve inverse geometric assembly problems).

Result: Evaluation of advanced MLLMs reveals they tend to prioritize matching target silhouettes while neglecting geometric constraints, leading to distortions or deformations of pieces.

Conclusion: The TangramPuzzle benchmark provides a rigorous, mathematically-grounded framework for evaluating compositional spatial reasoning in MLLMs, highlighting significant limitations in current models' geometric understanding.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in visual recognition and semantic understanding. Nevertheless, their ability to perform precise compositional spatial reasoning remains largely unexplored. Existing benchmarks often involve relatively simple tasks and rely on semantic approximations or coarse relative positioning, while their evaluation metrics are typically limited and lack rigorous mathematical formulations. To bridge this gap, we introduce TangramPuzzle, a geometry-grounded benchmark designed to evaluate compositional spatial reasoning through the lens of the classic Tangram game. We propose the Tangram Construction Expression (TCE), a symbolic geometric framework that grounds tangram assemblies in exact, machine-verifiable coordinate specifications, to mitigate the ambiguity of visual approximation. We design two complementary tasks: Outline Prediction, which demands inferring global shapes from local components, and End-to-End Code Generation, which requires solving inverse geometric assembly problems. We conduct extensive evaluation experiments on advanced open-source and proprietary models, revealing an interesting insight: MLLMs tend to prioritize matching the target silhouette while neglecting geometric constraints, leading to distortions or deformations of the pieces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-view 360° scene generation is crucial for real-world applications but remains highly ill-posed. Existing diffusion-based methods struggle with appearance consistency and geometric plausibility under large viewpoint changes.

Method: Proposes AnchoredDream with appearance-guided geometry generation first, then progressive scene completion through warp-and-inpaint, warp-and-refine, post-optimization, and a novel Grouting Block for seamless transitions.

Result: Extensive experiments show AnchoredDream outperforms existing methods by large margins in both appearance consistency and geometric plausibility, all in zero-shot manner.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of geometric grounding for high-quality, zero-shot single-view scene generation.

Abstract: Single-view indoor scene generation plays a crucial role in a range of real-world applications. However, generating a complete 360° scene from a single image remains a highly ill-posed and challenging problem. Recent approaches have made progress by leveraging diffusion models and depth estimation networks, yet they still struggle to maintain appearance consistency and geometric plausibility under large viewpoint changes, limiting their effectiveness in full-scene generation. To address this, we propose AnchoredDream, a novel zero-shot pipeline that anchors 360° scene generation on high-fidelity geometry via an appearance-geometry mutual boosting mechanism. Given a single-view image, our method first performs appearance-guided geometry generation to construct a reliable 3D scene layout. Then, we progressively generate the complete scene through a series of modules: warp-and-inpaint, warp-and-refine, post-optimization, and a novel Grouting Block, which ensures seamless transitions between the input view and generated regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnchoredDream outperforms existing methods by a large margin in both appearance consistency and geometric plausibility--all in a zero-shot manner. Our results highlight the potential of geometric grounding for high-quality, zero-shot single-view scene generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM methods lack continuous spatial understanding in changing environments and deployment feasibility for real-world embodied systems.

Method: Maintain finite spatial memory to handle accumulating video input, integrate 3D point clouds with semantic information for better object localization.

Result: Method effectively improves spatial understanding, evaluated with Fuzzy F1-Score on two datasets, demonstrating real-world deployment potential.

Conclusion: OnlineSI framework enables continuous spatial understanding for MLLMs, paving the way for practical embodied systems in dynamic environments.

Abstract: In recent years, researchers have increasingly been interested in how to enable Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) to possess spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities. However, most existing methods overlook the importance of the ability to continuously work in an ever-changing world, and lack the possibility of deployment on embodied systems in real-world environments. In this work, we introduce OnlineSI, a framework that can continuously improve its spatial understanding of its surroundings given a video stream. Our core idea is to maintain a finite spatial memory to retain past observations, ensuring the computation required for each inference does not increase as the input accumulates. We further integrate 3D point cloud information with semantic information, helping MLLM to better locate and identify objects in the scene. To evaluate our method, we introduce the Fuzzy $F_1$-Score to mitigate ambiguity, and test our method on two representative datasets. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, paving the way towards real-world embodied systems.

Motivation: To extend hierarchical open-set classification to semi-supervised setting, enabling use of large-scale uncurated datasets containing both known and unknown classes to improve performance.

Method: Teacher-student framework based on pseudo-labeling with two key components: 1) subtree pseudo-labels for reliable supervision with unknown data, and 2) age-gating mechanism to mitigate pseudo-label overconfidence.

Result: Outperforms self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised adaptation, and matches fully supervised counterpart with only 20 labeled samples per class on iNaturalist19 benchmark.

Conclusion: Proposed semi-supervised framework effectively leverages uncurated datasets for hierarchical open-set classification, achieving strong performance with minimal labeled data.

Abstract: Hierarchical open-set classification handles previously unseen classes by assigning them to the most appropriate high-level category in a class taxonomy. We extend this paradigm to the semi-supervised setting, enabling the use of large-scale, uncurated datasets containing a mixture of known and unknown classes to improve the hierarchical open-set performance. To this end, we propose a teacher-student framework based on pseudo-labeling. Two key components are introduced: 1) subtree pseudo-labels, which provide reliable supervision in the presence of unknown data, and 2) age-gating, a mechanism that mitigates overconfidence in pseudo-labels. Experiments show that our framework outperforms self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised adaptation, and even matches the fully supervised counterpart when using only 20 labeled samples per class on the iNaturalist19 benchmark.

TL;DR: HA2F is a hierarchical adaptive aggregation framework for remote sensing change detection that addresses feature alignment deviations and noise sensitivity through dual modules for dynamic feature calibration and noise-adaptive refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing remote sensing change detection methods suffer from cross-temporal feature matching deviations and sensitivity to radiometric/geometric noise, either focusing too much on localized patches or processing entire images holistically without proper feature alignment.

Method: Proposes HA2F with two modules: 1) Dynamic Hierarchical Feature Calibration Module (DHFCM) that fuses adjacent-level features through perceptual feature selection to address multi-temporal feature alignment, and 2) Noise-Adaptive Feature Refinement Module (NAFRM) that uses dual feature selection to highlight change-sensitive regions and generate spatial masks to suppress irrelevant areas/shadows.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and SYSU-CD datasets, surpassing existing methods in both precision metrics and computational efficiency. Ablation experiments confirm the effectiveness of both DHFCM and NAFRM modules.

Conclusion: HA2F effectively addresses feature alignment deviations and noise sensitivity in remote sensing change detection through its hierarchical adaptive aggregation framework, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency across multiple benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) aims to identify the spatio-temporal changes of land cover, providing critical support for multi-disciplinary applications (e.g., environmental monitoring, disaster assessment, and climate change studies). Existing methods focus either on extracting features from localized patches, or pursue processing entire images holistically, which leads to the cross temporal feature matching deviation and exhibiting sensitivity to radiometric and geometric noise. Following the above issues, we propose a dual-module collaboration guided hierarchical adaptive aggregation framework, namely HA2F, which consists of dynamic hierarchical feature calibration module (DHFCM) and noise-adaptive feature refinement module (NAFRM). The former dynamically fuses adjacent-level features through perceptual feature selection, suppressing irrelevant discrepancies to address multi-temporal feature alignment deviations. The NAFRM utilizes the dual feature selection mechanism to highlight the change sensitive regions and generate spatial masks, suppressing the interference of irrelevant regions or shadows. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed HA2F, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and SYSU-CD datasets, surpassing existing comparative methods in terms of both precision metrics and computational efficiency. In addition, ablation experiments show that DHFCM and NAFRM are effective. \href{https://huggingface.co/InPeerReview/RemoteSensingChangeDetection-RSCD.HA2F}{HA2F Official Code is Available Here!}

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CoVR frameworks fuse multimodal inputs in single stage with marginal gains; need better utilization of VLM representational power for improved video retrieval.

Method: Two-stage training framework with novel X-Aligner cross-attention module for progressive multimodal fusion, plus visual query caption enhancement. Built on BLIP-family VLMs.

Result: Achieves SOTA 63.93% Recall@1 on Webvid-CoVR-Test and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on CIRCO and Fashion-IQ datasets.

Conclusion: Proposed framework effectively leverages VLM power for CoVR, with X-Aligner enabling better multimodal fusion and alignment, showing promising generalization to CIR tasks.

Abstract: Composed Video Retrieval (CoVR) facilitates video retrieval by combining visual and textual queries. However, existing CoVR frameworks typically fuse multimodal inputs in a single stage, achieving only marginal gains over initial baseline. To address this, we propose a novel CoVR framework that leverages the representational power of Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our framework incorporates a novel cross-attention module X-Aligner, composed of cross-attention layers that progressively fuse visual and textual inputs and align their multimodal representation with that of the target video. To further enhance the representation of the multimodal query, we incorporate the caption of the visual query as an additional input. The framework is trained in two stages to preserve the pretrained VLM representation. In the first stage, only the newly introduced module is trained, while in the second stage, the textual query encoder is also fine-tuned. We implement our framework on top of BLIP-family architecture, namely BLIP and BLIP-2, and train it on the Webvid-CoVR data set. In addition to in-domain evaluation on Webvid-CoVR-Test, we perform zero-shot evaluations on the Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) data sets CIRCO and Fashion-IQ.

Conclusion: Provides practical and forward-looking solution for high-performance medical AI under resource-constrained settings through hybrid classical-quantum architecture with self-supervised learning.

Abstract: Intelligent medical image analysis is essential for clinical decision support but is often limited by scarce annotations, constrained computational resources, and suboptimal model generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight medical image classification framework that integrates self-supervised contrastive learning with quantum-enhanced feature modeling. MobileNetV2 is employed as a compact backbone and pretrained using a SimCLR-style self-supervised paradigm on unlabeled images. A lightweight parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) is embedded as a quantum feature enhancement module, forming a hybrid classical-quantum architecture, which is subsequently fine-tuned on limited labeled data. Experimental results demonstrate that, with only approximately 2-3 million parameters and low computational cost, the proposed method consistently outperforms classical baselines without self-supervised learning or quantum enhancement in terms of Accuracy, AUC, and F1-score. Feature visualization further indicates improved discriminability and representation stability. Overall, this work provides a practical and forward-looking solution for high-performance medical artificial intelligence under resource-constrained settings.

TL;DR: BPIM framework improves small object detection in UAV imagery by integrating boundary, position, and scale information through attention mechanisms and cross-scale feature fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAV applications face challenges in accurately detecting small objects due to imbalanced scales and blurred edges in aerial photography and object recognition.

Method: Proposed BPIM framework includes PIG module for location information, BIG module for object edges, CSF module for shallow feature assembly, TFF module for combining position/boundary information, and AWF module for deep semantic feature fusion.

Result: BPIM outperforms baseline Yolov5-P2 on VisDrone2021, DOTA1.0, and WiderPerson datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance with comparable computation load.

Conclusion: BPIM effectively addresses small object detection challenges in UAV imagery by integrating boundary, position, and scale information through attention mechanisms and cross-scale fusion strategies.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) applications have become increasingly prevalent in aerial photography and object recognition. However, there are major challenges to accurately capturing small targets in object detection due to the imbalanced scale and the blurred edges. To address these issues, boundary and position information mining (BPIM) framework is proposed for capturing object edge and location cues. The proposed BPIM includes position information guidance (PIG) module for obtaining location information, boundary information guidance (BIG) module for extracting object edge, cross scale fusion (CSF) module for gradually assembling the shallow layer image feature, three feature fusion (TFF) module for progressively combining position and boundary information, and adaptive weight fusion (AWF) module for flexibly merging the deep layer semantic feature. Therefore, BPIM can integrate boundary, position, and scale information in image for small object detection using attention mechanisms and cross-scale feature fusion strategies. Furthermore, BPIM not only improves the discrimination of the contextual feature by adaptive weight fusion with boundary, but also enhances small object perceptions by cross-scale position fusion. On the VisDrone2021, DOTA1.0, and WiderPerson datasets, experimental results show the better performances of BPIM compared to the baseline Yolov5-P2, and obtains the promising performance in the state-of-the-art methods with comparable computation load.

Abstract: The growing demand for diverse and high-quality facial datasets for training and testing biometric systems is challenged by privacy regulations, data scarcity, and ethical concerns. Synthetic facial images offer a potential solution, yet existing generative models often struggle to balance realism, diversity, and identity preservation. This paper presents SCHIGAND, a novel synthetic face generation pipeline integrating StyleCLIP, HyperStyle, InterfaceGAN, and Diffusion models to produce highly realistic and controllable facial datasets.

*Minsu Gong,Nuri Ryu,Jungseul Ok,Sunghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Structure Preservation Loss (SPL) using local linear models to maintain pixel-level edge structures in latent diffusion model image editing, with training-free integration and additional techniques for better results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) enable versatile text-prompt-driven image editing but struggle to maintain pixel-level edge structures crucial for photorealistic style transfer and image tone adjustment.

Method: Introduces Structure Preservation Loss (SPL) that uses local linear models to quantify structural differences, integrates it training-free into diffusion process, adds post-processing for LDM decoding distortions, masking for edit localization, and color preservation loss.

Result: SPL enhances structural fidelity and achieves state-of-the-art performance in latent-diffusion-based image editing.

Conclusion: The proposed SPL effectively addresses structural preservation challenges in LDM-based editing, offering improved performance while maintaining edit quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in image editing leverage latent diffusion models (LDMs) for versatile, text-prompt-driven edits across diverse tasks. Yet, maintaining pixel-level edge structures-crucial for tasks such as photorealistic style transfer or image tone adjustment-remains as a challenge for latent-diffusion-based editing. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Structure Preservation Loss (SPL) that leverages local linear models to quantify structural differences between input and edited images. Our training-free approach integrates SPL directly into the diffusion model's generative process to ensure structural fidelity. This core mechanism is complemented by a post-processing step to mitigate LDM decoding distortions, a masking strategy for precise edit localization, and a color preservation loss to preserve hues in unedited areas. Experiments confirm SPL enhances structural fidelity, delivering state-of-the-art performance in latent-diffusion-based image editing. Our code will be publicly released at https://github.com/gongms00/SPL.

TL;DR: REL-SF4PASS: A panoramic semantic segmentation method using novel REL depth representation in cylindrical coordinates and Spherical-dynamic Multi-Modal Fusion (SMMF) to improve performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PASS methods don't fully utilize panoramic image geometry - they either focus on spherical geometry with RGB input or use depth information in suboptimal formats (original/HHA), missing opportunities for better 3D representation.

Method: Proposes REL depth representation (Rectified Depth, Elevation-Gained Vertical Inclination Angle, Lateral Orientation Angle) in cylindrical coordinates, plus Spherical-dynamic Multi-Modal Fusion (SMMF) that uses different fusion strategies for different panoramic regions to handle ERP projection distortions.

Result: Achieves 2.35% average mIoU improvement on all 3 folds of Stanford2D3D Panoramic datasets and reduces performance variance by ~70% when facing 3D disturbances, showing improved robustness.

Conclusion: The REL-SF4PASS framework effectively leverages panoramic geometry through cylindrical coordinate representation and adaptive multi-modal fusion, significantly enhancing PASS performance and robustness against 3D disturbances.

Abstract: As an important and challenging problem in computer vision, Panoramic Semantic Segmentation (PASS) aims to give complete scene perception based on an ultra-wide angle of view. Most PASS methods often focus on spherical geometry with RGB input or using the depth information in original or HHA format, which does not make full use of panoramic image geometry. To address these shortcomings, we propose REL-SF4PASS with our REL depth representation based on cylindrical coordinate and Spherical-dynamic Multi-Modal Fusion SMMF. REL is made up of Rectified Depth, Elevation-Gained Vertical Inclination Angle, and Lateral Orientation Angle, which fully represents 3D space in cylindrical coordinate style and the surface normal direction. SMMF aims to ensure the diversity of fusion for different panoramic image regions and reduce the breakage of cylinder side surface expansion in ERP projection, which uses different fusion strategies to match the different regions in panoramic images. Experimental results show that REL-SF4PASS considerably improves performance and robustness on popular benchmark, Stanford2D3D Panoramic datasets. It gains 2.35% average mIoU improvement on all 3 folds and reduces the performance variance by approximately 70% when facing 3D disturbance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting aesthetic experiences in interior design is challenging due to subjective perception and complex visual responses. Understanding how people perceive and evaluate interior spaces is crucial for designing environments that promote well-being.

Method: Developed a dual-branch CNN-LSTM framework that fuses visual features from interior design videos with synchronized eye-tracking signals (gaze data and pupil responses). Collected dataset of 224 interior design videos with gaze data from 28 participants who rated 15 aesthetic dimensions.

Result: Model achieved 72.2% accuracy on objective dimensions (e.g., light) and 66.8% on subjective dimensions (e.g., relaxation), outperforming state-of-the-art video baselines. Models trained with eye-tracking retain comparable performance when deployed with visual input alone. Pupil responses contribute most to objective assessments, while gaze+visual combination enhances subjective evaluations.

Conclusion: Eye-tracking serves as valuable privileged information during training, enabling more practical tools for aesthetic assessment in interior design. The approach demonstrates that incorporating physiological signals can improve prediction of both objective and subjective aesthetic evaluations.

Abstract: Understanding how people perceive and evaluate interior spaces is essential for designing environments that promote well-being. However, predicting aesthetic experiences remains difficult due to the subjective nature of perception and the complexity of visual responses. This study introduces a dual-branch CNN-LSTM framework that fuses visual features with eye-tracking signals to predict aesthetic evaluations of residential interiors. We collected a dataset of 224 interior design videos paired with synchronized gaze data from 28 participants who rated 15 aesthetic dimensions. The proposed model attains 72.2% accuracy on objective dimensions (e.g., light) and 66.8% on subjective dimensions (e.g., relaxation), outperforming state-of-the-art video baselines and showing clear gains on subjective evaluation tasks. Notably, models trained with eye-tracking retain comparable performance when deployed with visual input alone. Ablation experiments further reveal that pupil responses contribute most to objective assessments, while the combination of gaze and visual cues enhances subjective evaluations. These findings highlight the value of incorporating eye-tracking as privileged information during training, enabling more practical tools for aesthetic assessment in interior design.

TL;DR: ReWeaver: A framework for topology-accurate 3D garment and sewing pattern reconstruction from sparse multi-view RGB images, enabling high-fidelity physical simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing garment reconstruction methods use unstructured representations (like 3D Gaussian Splats) that struggle with accurate garment topology and sewing structures, making them unsuitable for high-fidelity physical simulation needed in digital avatars, virtual try-on, and robotic manipulation.

Method: ReWeaver predicts seams and panels with their connectivities in both 2D UV space and 3D space from as few as four input views. The framework uses a large-scale synthetic dataset GCD-TS with over 100,000 samples containing multi-view RGB images, 3D geometries, textured body meshes, and annotated sewing patterns.

Result: ReWeaver consistently outperforms existing methods in topology accuracy, geometry alignment, and seam-panel consistency. The reconstructed outputs provide structured 2D-3D garment representations suitable for 3D perception, high-fidelity physical simulation, and robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: ReWeaver addresses the limitations of unstructured garment reconstruction methods by providing topology-accurate 3D garment and sewing pattern reconstruction from sparse multi-view images, bridging the sim-to-real gap for applications requiring high-fidelity physical simulation.

Abstract: High-quality 3D garment reconstruction plays a crucial role in mitigating the sim-to-real gap in applications such as digital avatars, virtual try-on and robotic manipulation. However, existing garment reconstruction methods typically rely on unstructured representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splats, struggling to provide accurate reconstructions of garment topology and sewing structures. As a result, the reconstructed outputs are often unsuitable for high-fidelity physical simulation. We propose ReWeaver, a novel framework for topology-accurate 3D garment and sewing pattern reconstruction from sparse multi-view RGB images. Given as few as four input views, ReWeaver predicts seams and panels as well as their connectivities in both the 2D UV space and the 3D space. The predicted seams and panels align precisely with the multi-view images, yielding structured 2D--3D garment representations suitable for 3D perception, high-fidelity physical simulation, and robotic manipulation. To enable effective training, we construct a large-scale dataset GCD-TS, comprising multi-view RGB images, 3D garment geometries, textured human body meshes and annotated sewing patterns. The dataset contains over 100,000 synthetic samples covering a wide range of complex geometries and topologies. Extensive experiments show that ReWeaver consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of topology accuracy, geometry alignment and seam-panel consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing contrastive learning methods for skeleton-based activity understanding fail to exploit structural inter-class similarities and overlook the impact of anomalous positive samples, limiting feature discrimination.

Method: Proposes ACLNet with: 1) affinity metric to refine similarity measurements and form activity superclasses, 2) dynamic temperature schedule to adaptively adjust penalty strength for different superclasses, 3) margin-based contrastive strategy to improve separation of hard positive/negative samples.

Result: Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, Kinetics-Skeleton, PKU-MMD, FineGYM, and CASIA-B demonstrate superiority in skeleton-based action recognition, gait recognition, and person re-identification.

Conclusion: ACLNet effectively improves feature discrimination in skeleton-based human activity understanding by exploring clustering relationships among activity classes and addressing limitations of existing contrastive learning approaches.

Abstract: In skeleton-based human activity understanding, existing methods often adopt the contrastive learning paradigm to construct a discriminative feature space. However, many of these approaches fail to exploit the structural inter-class similarities and overlook the impact of anomalous positive samples. In this study, we introduce ACLNet, an Affinity Contrastive Learning Network that explores the intricate clustering relationships among human activity classes to improve feature discrimination. Specifically, we propose an affinity metric to refine similarity measurements, thereby forming activity superclasses that provide more informative contrastive signals. A dynamic temperature schedule is also introduced to adaptively adjust the penalty strength for various superclasses. In addition, we employ a margin-based contrastive strategy to improve the separation of hard positive and negative samples within classes. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, Kinetics-Skeleton, PKU-MMD, FineGYM, and CASIA-B demonstrate the superiority of our method in skeleton-based action recognition, gait recognition, and person re-identification.

### [38] [No Validation, No Problem: Predicting Model Performance from a Single Gradient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16874)
*Fangzheng Wu,Brian Summa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A validation-free checkpoint selection method using classifier-head gradient norm from one batch predicts model performance across tasks without validation labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate the need for validation data and labels for checkpoint selection and early stopping, which is especially valuable when validation data is scarce or unavailable.

Method: Use Frobenius norm of classifier-head gradient from a single forward-backward pass on one detached-feature batch as a proxy for model performance. Apply head-scale normalization for CNNs and feature-scale normalization for Transformers.

Result: The gradient norm proxy strongly correlates with Top-1 accuracy (negative) and loss (positive). It closes most gap to oracle selection (4.24% ± 2.00% with universal setup, ~1.12% with tuning). Also works for COCO detection/segmentation and diffusion models.

Conclusion: The method provides a lightweight, label-free alternative to validation-based checkpoint selection, adding minimal computational overhead (<0.1% of epoch) while maintaining strong performance prediction across diverse architectures and tasks.

Abstract: We propose a validation-free checkpointing signal from a single forward-backward pass: the Frobenius norm of the classifier-head gradient on one detached-feature batch, ||g||_F = ||dL/dW||_F. Across ImageNet-1k CNNs and Transformers, this proxy is strongly negative with Top-1 and positive with loss. Selecting the checkpoint with the minimum head gradient in a short tail window closes most of the gap to the oracle (4.24% +/- 2.00% with a universal setup, about 1.12% with light per-family tuning). For practical deployment, a head-scale normalization is more stable within classic CNN families (e.g., ResNets), while a feature-scale normalization works well for Transformers and modern CNNs. The same one-batch probe also predicts COCO detection/segmentation mAP. In diffusion (UNet/DDPM on CIFAR-10), it tracks progress and enables near-oracle tail-window selection; it is positively correlated with same-distribution probe MSE and negatively with FID (lower is better), so it can be used as a lightweight, label-free monitor. Validation labels are never used beyond reporting. The probe adds much less than 0.1% of an epoch and works as a drop-in for validation-free checkpoint selection and early stopping.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CER-HV framework improves Arabic-script HTR by detecting and cleaning label errors in datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arabic-script handwritten text recognition lags behind Latin-script HTR due to data quality issues in existing datasets, including transcription, segmentation, orientation, and non-text content errors.

Method: CER-HV framework combines CER-based noise detector (using carefully configured CRNN with early stopping) with human-in-the-loop verification to identify and clean label errors in datasets.

Result: Achieved SOTA performance on 5/6 datasets (8.45% CER on KHATT, 8.26% on PHTI, 10.66% on Ajami, 10.11% on Muharaf), identified errors with 80-90% precision, and improved CER by 0.3-1.8% after cleaning.

Conclusion: Data quality is a major bottleneck for Arabic-script HTR, and the CER-HV framework effectively addresses this by detecting and cleaning label errors, with potential applicability to other text recognition domains.

Abstract: Handwritten text recognition (HTR) for Arabic-script languages still lags behind Latin-script HTR, despite recent advances in model architectures, datasets, and benchmarks. We show that data quality is a significant limiting factor in many published datasets and propose CER-HV (CER-based Ranking with Human Verification) as a framework to detect and clean label errors. CER-HV combines a CER-based noise detector, built on a carefully configured Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) with early stopping to avoid overfitting noisy samples, and a human-in-the-loop (HITL) step that verifies high-ranking samples. The framework reveals that several existing datasets contain previously underreported problems, including transcription, segmentation, orientation, and non-text content errors. These have been identified with up to 90 percent precision in the Muharaf and 80-86 percent in the PHTI datasets.
  We also show that our CRNN achieves state-of-the-art performance across five of the six evaluated datasets, reaching 8.45 percent Character Error Rate (CER) on KHATT (Arabic), 8.26 percent on PHTI (Pashto), 10.66 percent on Ajami, and 10.11 percent on Muharaf (Arabic), all without any data cleaning. We establish a new baseline of 11.3 percent CER on the PHTD (Persian) dataset. Applying CER-HV improves the evaluation CER by 0.3-0.6 percent on the cleaner datasets and 1.0-1.8 percent on the noisier ones. Although our experiments focus on documents written in an Arabic-script language, including Arabic, Persian, Urdu, Ajami, and Pashto, the framework is general and can be applied to other text recognition datasets.

TL;DR: Large vision-language models (VLMs) show strong potential for surgical tool detection, with Qwen2.5 outperforming other VLMs and demonstrating competitive performance against specialized detection models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems in surgery are mostly unimodal and lack holistic understanding of surgical workflows. There's a need for general-purpose surgical AI systems that can comprehensively model interrelated surgical scene components, and recent VLMs offer potential for human-like scene reasoning.

Method: Evaluated three state-of-the-art VLMs (Qwen2.5, LLaVA1.5, InternVL3.5) on the GraSP robotic surgery dataset for surgical tool detection. Tested both zero-shot and parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning settings, and compared against open-set detection baseline Grounding DINO.

Result: Qwen2.5 consistently achieved superior detection performance among VLMs in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. Compared to Grounding DINO, Qwen2.5 showed stronger zero-shot generalization and comparable fine-tuned performance, with Qwen2.5 excelling at instrument recognition while Grounding DINO had stronger localization.

Conclusion: Large VLMs demonstrate promising capabilities for surgical vision tasks, particularly surgical tool detection. Qwen2.5 emerges as a strong performer, showing that VLMs can provide effective multimodal understanding for surgical applications and potentially serve as general-purpose surgical AI systems.

Abstract: Surgery is a highly complex process, and artificial intelligence has emerged as a transformative force in supporting surgical guidance and decision-making. However, the unimodal nature of most current AI systems limits their ability to achieve a holistic understanding of surgical workflows. This highlights the need for general-purpose surgical AI systems capable of comprehensively modeling the interrelated components of surgical scenes. Recent advances in large vision-language models that integrate multimodal data processing offer strong potential for modeling surgical tasks and providing human-like scene reasoning and understanding. Despite their promise, systematic investigations of VLMs in surgical applications remain limited. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of large VLMs for the fundamental surgical vision task of detecting surgical tools. Specifically, we investigate three state-of-the-art VLMs, Qwen2.5, LLaVA1.5, and InternVL3.5, on the GraSP robotic surgery dataset under both zero-shot and parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning settings. Our results demonstrate that Qwen2.5 consistently achieves superior detection performance in both configurations among the evaluated VLMs. Furthermore, compared with the open-set detection baseline Grounding DINO, Qwen2.5 exhibits stronger zero-shot generalization and comparable fine-tuned performance. Notably, Qwen2.5 shows superior instrument recognition, while Grounding DINO demonstrates stronger localization.

*Yann Le Gall,Nicolas Burlet,Mathieu Simon,Fabien Novella,Samantha Dugelay,Jean-Philippe Malkasse*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using sub-aperture filtering and fixed focus shadow enhancement to extract shadow information from Circular SAS data for improved target analysis and 3D reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CSAS provides 360° azimuth coverage but loses shadow information that's valuable for target recognition in mine warfare. Shadows provide complementary shape information that can reduce false alarms and aid 3D reconstruction.

Method: Sub-aperture filtering creates multiple viewpoint images along the circular trajectory, then fixed focus shadow enhancement (FFSE) extracts sharp shadows. An interactive interface visualizes shadows, and space-carving reconstruction infers 3D shape from segmented shadows.

Result: Demonstrates successful extraction of shadow information from CSAS data and shows potential for improving target analysis and enabling 3D reconstruction from circular SAS data.

Conclusion: Shadows in circular SAS provide valuable complementary information for target recognition and 3D reconstruction, offering improved analysis capabilities for mine warfare applications.

Abstract: Circular Synthetic Aperture Sonar (CSAS) provides a 360° azimuth view of the seabed, surpassing the limited aperture and mono-view image of conventional side-scan SAS. This makes CSAS a valuable tool for target recognition in mine warfare where the diversity of point of view is essential for reducing false alarms. CSAS processing typically produces a very high-resolution two-dimensional image. However, the parallax introduced by the circular displacement of the illuminator fill-in the shadow regions, and the shadow cast by an object on the seafloor is lost in favor of azimuth coverage and resolution. Yet the shadows provide complementary information on target shape useful for target recognition. In this paper, we explore a way to retrieve shadow information from CSAS data to improve target analysis and carry 3D reconstruction. Sub-aperture filtering is used to get a collection of images at various points of view along the circular trajectory and fixed focus shadow enhancement (FFSE) is applied to obtain sharp shadows. An interactive interface is also proposed to allow human operators to visualize these shadows along the circular trajectory. A space-carving reconstruction method is applied to infer the 3D shape of the object from the segmented shadows. The results demonstrate the potential of shadows in circular SAS for improving target analysis and 3D reconstruction.

TL;DR: Proposes training-free multi-head RoPE jitter to fix sink-collapse in autoregressive video generation, enabling real-time infinite-length videos up to 12 hours.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive video models suffer from error accumulation and loss of long-term coherence. Attention sink frames help but cause sink-collapse - generated content repeatedly reverts to sink frames, causing abrupt scene resets and cyclic motion patterns.

Method: Lightweight, training-free approach using multi-head RoPE jitter that breaks inter-head attention homogenization and mitigates long-horizon collapse. Addresses conflict between RoPE's periodic structure and multi-head attention mechanisms.

Result: Successfully alleviates sink-collapse while preserving generation quality. Achieves first demonstration of real-time, streaming, infinite-length video generation with little quality decay. Generated continuous videos up to 12 hours long.

Conclusion: Proposed method effectively suppresses sink-collapse in autoregressive video generation, enabling robust long-form video synthesis with unprecedented length and coherence.

Abstract: Recent research in long-form video generation has shifted from bidirectional to autoregressive models, yet these methods commonly suffer from error accumulation and a loss of long-term coherence. While attention sink frames have been introduced to mitigate this performance decay, they often induce a critical failure mode we term sink-collapse: the generated content repeatedly reverts to the sink frame, resulting in abrupt scene resets and cyclic motion patterns. Our analysis reveals that sink-collapse originates from an inherent conflict between the periodic structure of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and the multi-head attention mechanisms prevalent in current generative models. To address it, we propose a lightweight, training-free approach that effectively suppresses this behavior by introducing multi-head RoPE jitter that breaks inter-head attention homogenization and mitigates long-horizon collapse. Extensive experiments show that our method successfully alleviates sink-collapse while preserving generation quality. To the best of our knowledge, this work achieves the first demonstration of real-time, streaming, and infinite-length video generation with little quality decay. As an illustration of this robustness, we generate continuous videos up to 12 hours in length, which, to our knowledge, is among the longest publicly demonstrated results in streaming video generation.

### [43] [A Step to Decouple Optimization in 3DGS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16736)
*Renjie Ding,Yaonan Wang,Min Liu,Jialin Zhu,Jiazheng Wang,Jiahao Zhao,Wenting Shen,Feixiang He,Xiang Che*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies optimization issues in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) related to update step coupling and gradient coupling, proposes decoupled components (Sparse Adam, Re-State Regularization, Decoupled Attribute Regularization), and introduces AdamW-GS for improved optimization efficiency and representation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3DGS optimization inherits DNN practices but overlooks two critical coupling issues: (1) update step coupling causing optimizer state rescaling and costly attribute updates outside viewpoints, and (2) gradient coupling in moments leading to under- or over-effective regularization. These complex couplings are under-explored despite their physical significance in 3DGS.

Method: The authors revisit 3DGS optimization, decouple it into three components: Sparse Adam, Re-State Regularization, and Decoupled Attribute Regularization. They conduct extensive experiments under both 3DGS and 3DGS-MCMC frameworks, then propose AdamW-GS by re-coupling the beneficial components based on empirical analysis.

Result: Through comprehensive experiments, the paper provides deeper understanding of optimization components in 3DGS. The proposed AdamW-GS achieves simultaneous improvements in both optimization efficiency and representation effectiveness compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The work reveals overlooked optimization issues in 3DGS, demonstrates the benefits of decoupling optimization components, and introduces AdamW-GS as an improved optimization method that better balances efficiency and representation quality for 3D Gaussian Splatting.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful technique for real-time novel view synthesis. As an explicit representation optimized through gradient propagation among primitives, optimization widely accepted in deep neural networks (DNNs) is actually adopted in 3DGS, such as synchronous weight updating and Adam with the adaptive gradient. However, considering the physical significance and specific design in 3DGS, there are two overlooked details in the optimization of 3DGS: (i) update step coupling, which induces optimizer state rescaling and costly attribute updates outside the viewpoints, and (ii) gradient coupling in the moment, which may lead to under- or over-effective regularization. Nevertheless, such a complex coupling is under-explored. After revisiting the optimization of 3DGS, we take a step to decouple it and recompose the process into: Sparse Adam, Re-State Regularization and Decoupled Attribute Regularization. Taking a large number of experiments under the 3DGS and 3DGS-MCMC frameworks, our work provides a deeper understanding of these components. Finally, based on the empirical analysis, we re-design the optimization and propose AdamW-GS by re-coupling the beneficial components, under which better optimization efficiency and representation effectiveness are achieved simultaneously.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Open-source data framework using airborne imagery and OSM with YOLOv11 for highway crack detection, creating Swiss RHCD index to guide maintenance strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change-induced temperature fluctuations increase stress on road pavements, raising maintenance costs, necessitating targeted and efficient maintenance strategies using accessible data.

Method: Integrates airborne imagery and OpenStreetMap to fine-tune YOLOv11 for highway crack localization, calculates Swiss Relative Highway Crack Density (RHCD) index for nationwide maintenance guidance.

Result: Crack classification achieved F1-scores of 0.84 (crack) and 0.97 (no crack). RHCD showed weak correlations with temperature amplitudes (r=-0.05) and traffic volume (r=0.17), with high values near urban centers and intersections.

Conclusion: Open-source data sharing enables innovative, efficient public sector solutions for highway maintenance, with RHCD providing valuable maintenance guidance beyond traditional temperature and traffic data.

Abstract: Highway networks are crucial for economic prosperity. Climate change-induced temperature fluctuations are exacerbating stress on road pavements, resulting in elevated maintenance costs. This underscores the need for targeted and efficient maintenance strategies. This study investigates the potential of open-source data to guide highway infrastructure maintenance. The proposed framework integrates airborne imagery and OpenStreetMap (OSM) to fine-tune YOLOv11 for highway crack localization. To demonstrate the framework's real-world applicability, a Swiss Relative Highway Crack Density (RHCD) index was calculated to inform nationwide highway maintenance. The crack classification model achieved an F1-score of $0.84$ for the positive class (crack) and $0.97$ for the negative class (no crack). The Swiss RHCD index exhibited weak correlations with Long-term Land Surface Temperature Amplitudes (LT-LST-A) (Pearson's $r\ = -0.05$) and Traffic Volume (TV) (Pearson's $r\ = 0.17$), underlining the added value of this novel index for guiding maintenance over other data. Significantly high RHCD values were observed near urban centers and intersections, providing contextual validation for the predictions. These findings highlight the value of open-source data sharing to drive innovation, ultimately enabling more efficient solutions in the public sector.

TL;DR: FMPose: A flow matching-based probabilistic 3D human pose estimation method that generates accurate 3D poses from 2D cues using optimal transport and graph convolutional networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D human pose estimation from monocular views is ill-posed due to depth ambiguity, and existing methods often produce incorrect-yet-overconfident 3D estimations. Probabilistic approaches that treat 3D estimations as distributions with uncertainty measurement are needed to address this problem.

Method: FMPose uses flow matching generative approach to learn optimal transport from simple source distribution to plausible 3D human pose distribution via continuous normalizing flows. It conditions on 2D cues using graph convolutional networks that leverage learnable connections between human body joints as graph structure for feature aggregation.

Result: FMPose produces faster and more accurate 3D pose generations compared to diffusion-based methods. Experimental results show major improvements over current state-of-the-art methods on three benchmarks: Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW.

Conclusion: The proposed FMPose method effectively addresses the ill-posed nature of 3D human pose estimation from monocular views by combining flow matching generative approach with graph convolutional networks, achieving state-of-the-art performance with faster inference than diffusion-based alternatives.

Abstract: Recovering 3D human poses from a monocular camera view is a highly ill-posed problem due to the depth ambiguity. Earlier studies on 3D human pose lifting from 2D often contain incorrect-yet-overconfident 3D estimations. To mitigate the problem, emerging probabilistic approaches treat the 3D estimations as a distribution, taking into account the uncertainty measurement of the poses. Falling in a similar category, we proposed FMPose, a probabilistic 3D human pose estimation method based on the flow matching generative approach. Conditioned on the 2D cues, the flow matching scheme learns the optimal transport from a simple source distribution to the plausible 3D human pose distribution via continuous normalizing flows. The 2D lifting condition is modeled via graph convolutional networks, leveraging the learnable connections between human body joints as the graph structure for feature aggregation. Compared to diffusion-based methods, the FMPose with optimal transport produces faster and more accurate 3D pose generations. Experimental results show major improvements of our FMPose over current state-of-the-art methods on three common benchmarks for 3D human pose estimation, namely Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP and 3DPW.

*Jiahao Li,Yunpeng Bai,Yongkang Dai,Hao Guo,Hongping Gan,Yilei Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrepARG: First method to encode B-rep geometry and topology into holistic token sequences for autoregressive generation using transformers, achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous graph-based B-rep approaches decouple geometric and topological features, preventing use of sequence-based generative frameworks like transformers that have shown remarkable performance. There's a need for holistic representation enabling sequence-based generation.

Method: Encodes B-rep into three token types: geometry tokens, position tokens, and face index tokens. Constructs holistic token sequence hierarchically: first builds geometry blocks (faces/edges), then sequences these blocks, finally assembles complete B-rep sequence. Uses transformer-based autoregressive model with multi-layer decoder-only architecture and causal masking for next-token prediction.

Result: BrepARG achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in B-rep generation, validating the feasibility of representing B-rep as holistic token sequences.

Conclusion: BrepARG successfully demonstrates that B-rep can be represented as holistic token sequences, opening new directions for B-rep generation using sequence-based generative frameworks like transformers.

Abstract: Previous representation and generation approaches for the B-rep relied on graph-based representations that disentangle geometric and topological features through decoupled computational pipelines, thereby precluding the application of sequence-based generative frameworks, such as transformer architectures that have demonstrated remarkable performance. In this paper, we propose BrepARG, the first attempt to encode B-rep's geometry and topology into a holistic token sequence representation, enabling sequence-based B-rep generation with an autoregressive architecture. Specifically, BrepARG encodes B-rep into 3 types of tokens: geometry and position tokens representing geometric features, and face index tokens representing topology. Then the holistic token sequence is constructed hierarchically, starting with constructing the geometry blocks (i.e., faces and edges) using the above tokens, followed by geometry block sequencing. Finally, we assemble the holistic sequence representation for the entire B-rep. We also construct a transformer-based autoregressive model that learns the distribution over holistic token sequences via next-token prediction, using a multi-layer decoder-only architecture with causal masking. Experiments demonstrate that BrepARG achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. BrepARG validates the feasibility of representing B-rep as holistic token sequences, opening new directions for B-rep generation.

*Shuai Huang,Xuhan Lin,Yuwu Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CASP introduces CLS token attention steering prompts with trainable bias parameters to modulate self-attention weights, plus attention perturbation and manifold token mixup for better generalization in few-shot class-incremental learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt-based FSCIL methods struggle with extreme few-shot settings where transfer and generalization capabilities are critical. There's a need to better leverage pretrained knowledge to learn feature representations that can be shared across future categories during the base session.

Method: Proposes CLS Token Attention Steering Prompts (CASP) with class-shared trainable bias parameters in query, key, and value projections of CLS token to modulate self-attention weights. Also includes attention perturbation strategy and Manifold Token Mixup in shallow feature space to synthesize potential new class features.

Result: CASP outperforms state-of-the-art methods on CUB200, CIFAR100, and ImageNet-R datasets in both standard and fine-grained FSCIL settings, without requiring fine-tuning during incremental phases and with significantly reduced parameter overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed CASP framework effectively addresses FSCIL challenges by steering CLS token attention, enhancing generalization through perturbation and mixup strategies, achieving superior performance with minimal parameter overhead and no incremental fine-tuning.

Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) presents a core challenge in continual learning, requiring models to rapidly adapt to new classes with very limited samples while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Recent prompt-based methods, which integrate pretrained backbones with task-specific prompts, have made notable progress. However, under extreme few-shot incremental settings, the model's ability to transfer and generalize becomes critical, and it is thus essential to leverage pretrained knowledge to learn feature representations that can be shared across future categories during the base session. Inspired by the mechanism of the CLS token, which is similar to human attention and progressively filters out task-irrelevant information, we propose the CLS Token Attention Steering Prompts (CASP). This approach introduces class-shared trainable bias parameters into the query, key, and value projections of the CLS token to explicitly modulate the self-attention weights. To further enhance generalization, we also design an attention perturbation strategy and perform Manifold Token Mixup in the shallow feature space, synthesizing potential new class features to improve generalization and reserve the representation capacity for upcoming tasks. Experiments on the CUB200, CIFAR100, and ImageNet-R datasets demonstrate that CASP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both standard and fine-grained FSCIL settings without requiring fine-tuning during incremental phases and while significantly reducing the parameter overhead.

TL;DR: Novel method for automated detection of spinal ligament landmarks using shape-based segmentation and domain-specific rules, achieving high accuracy across all spinal regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise identification of ligament attachment landmarks is crucial for realistic biomechanical spine modeling, but existing automated methods are limited to specific regions or lack sufficient accuracy.

Method: Two-stage approach: first performs shape-based segmentation of 3D vertebrae, then applies domain-specific rules to identify different types of ligament attachment points.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches with mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.7 mm and root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.1 mm on two independent spinal datasets, demonstrating strong generalization across all spinal regions.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a reliable, accurate, and generalizable solution for automated spinal ligament landmark detection, enabling more realistic biomechanical spine modeling.

Abstract: In biomechanical modeling, the representation of ligament attachments is crucial for a realistic simulation of the forces acting between the vertebrae. These forces are typically modeled as vectors connecting ligament landmarks on adjacent vertebrae, making precise identification of these landmarks a key requirement for constructing reliable spine models. Existing automated detection methods are either limited to specific spinal regions or lack sufficient accuracy. This work presents a novel approach for detecting spinal ligament landmarks, which first performs shape-based segmentation of 3D vertebrae and subsequently applies domain-specific rules to identify different types of attachment points. The proposed method outperforms existing approaches by achieving high accuracy and demonstrating strong generalization across all spinal regions. Validation on two independent spinal datasets from multiple patients yielded a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.7 mm and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.1 mm.

TL;DR: ColorConceptBench is a new benchmark for evaluating how text-to-image models associate colors with implicit concepts, revealing current models lack sensitivity to abstract color semantics despite scaling and guidance techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models have advanced significantly, but their ability to associate colors with implicit concepts remains underexplored and poorly understood. There's a need to systematically evaluate how models translate abstract color concepts beyond explicit color names or codes.

Method: The authors introduce ColorConceptBench, a human-annotated benchmark with 1,281 implicit color concepts and 6,369 human annotations, using probabilistic color distributions to evaluate color-concept associations. They test seven leading T2I models and examine standard interventions like scaling and guidance.

Result: Evaluation reveals that current T2I models lack sensitivity to abstract color semantics, and this limitation persists despite standard interventions like model scaling and guidance techniques. The problem appears resistant to conventional improvements.

Conclusion: Achieving human-like color semantics in T2I models requires more than just larger models or technical tweaks; it demands a fundamental shift in how models learn and represent implicit meaning, suggesting new approaches to semantic understanding are needed.

Abstract: While text-to-image (T2I) models have advanced considerably, their capability to associate colors with implicit concepts remains underexplored. To address the gap, we introduce ColorConceptBench, a new human-annotated benchmark to systematically evaluate color-concept associations through the lens of probabilistic color distributions. ColorConceptBench moves beyond explicit color names or codes by probing how models translate 1,281 implicit color concepts using a foundation of 6,369 human annotations. Our evaluation of seven leading T2I models reveals that current models lack sensitivity to abstract semantics, and crucially, this limitation appears resistant to standard interventions (e.g., scaling and guidance). This demonstrates that achieving human-like color semantics requires more than larger models, but demands a fundamental shift in how models learn and represent implicit meaning.

*Jingran Zhang,Ning Li,Yuanhao Ban,Andrew Bai,Justin Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Autoregressive video generation using reward signals instead of teacher models achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods while simplifying training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior autoregressive video generation models rely heavily on teacher models, which limit performance and output quality, especially without strong autoregressive teachers. The paper aims to develop a more efficient and scalable approach.

Method: Uses reward signals to guide the autoregressive generation process, simplifying training while maintaining visual fidelity and temporal consistency without dependence on teacher architectures.

Result: Achieves comparable performance to existing autoregressive models (84.92 vs 84.31 on VBench) and sometimes surpasses similarly sized bidirectional models by avoiding teacher architecture constraints.

Conclusion: Reward-guided autoregressive generation provides an effective alternative to teacher-dependent approaches, offering simplified training while maintaining competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: While most prior work in video generation relies on bidirectional architectures, recent efforts have sought to adapt these models into autoregressive variants to support near real-time generation. However, such adaptations often depend heavily on teacher models, which can limit performance, particularly in the absence of a strong autoregressive teacher, resulting in output quality that typically lags behind their bidirectional counterparts. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach that uses reward signals to guide the generation process, enabling more efficient and scalable autoregressive generation. By using reward signals to guide the model, our method simplifies training while preserving high visual fidelity and temporal consistency. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, we find that our approach performs comparably to existing autoregressive models and, in some cases, surpasses similarly sized bidirectional models by avoiding constraints imposed by teacher architectures. For example, on VBench, our method achieves a total score of 84.92, closely matching state-of-the-art autoregressive methods that score 84.31 but require significant heterogeneous distillation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning for medical image segmentation requires large expert annotations and consistent data, but real-world scenarios have scarce annotations and mixed-domain data from multiple scanners/centers with unknown domain labels and severe domain gaps.

Method: Domain-invariant mixed-domain semi-supervised segmentation framework with: 1) Copy-Paste Mechanism (CPM) to augment training by transferring informative regions across domains, 2) Cluster Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) block that clusters unlabeled features and aligns them with labeled anchors via MMD objective for domain-invariant representations, 3) Integrated within a teacher-student framework.

Result: Experiments on Fundus and M&Ms benchmarks show the approach consistently surpasses semi-supervised and domain adaptation methods, achieving robust and precise segmentation with very few labeled examples and multiple unknown domain discrepancies.

Conclusion: Establishes a potential solution for mixed-domain semi-supervised medical image segmentation by jointly enhancing data diversity and mitigating domain bias in real-world deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Deep learning has shown remarkable progress in medical image semantic segmentation, yet its success heavily depends on large-scale expert annotations and consistent data distributions. In practice, annotations are scarce, and images are collected from multiple scanners or centers, leading to mixed-domain settings with unknown domain labels and severe domain gaps. Existing semi-supervised or domain adaptation approaches typically assume either a single domain shift or access to explicit domain indices, which rarely hold in real-world deployment. In this paper, we propose a domain-invariant mixed-domain semi-supervised segmentation framework that jointly enhances data diversity and mitigates domain bias. A Copy-Paste Mechanism (CPM) augments the training set by transferring informative regions across domains, while a Cluster Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) block clusters unlabeled features and aligns them with labeled anchors via an MMD objective, encouraging domain-invariant representations. Integrated within a teacher-student framework, our method achieves robust and precise segmentation even with very few labeled examples and multiple unknown domain discrepancies. Experiments on Fundus and M&Ms benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses semi-supervised and domain adaptation methods, establishing a potential solution for mixed-domain semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language Models are poorly characterized in multi-step visual interactions, particularly in how they integrate perception, memory, and action over long horizons. There's a need for systematic evaluation of VLMs in interactive settings.

Method: Created VisGym, a gymnasium of 17 environments spanning symbolic puzzles, real-image understanding, navigation, and manipulation with flexible controls over difficulty, input representation, planning horizon, and feedback. Also developed multi-step solvers to generate structured demonstrations for supervised finetuning.

Result: All frontier models struggle in interactive settings, achieving low success rates (46.6% easy, 26.0% hard). Models perform worse with unbounded history than truncated windows, and text-based symbolic tasks become substantially harder when rendered visually. Explicit goal observations, textual feedback, and exploratory demonstrations yield consistent improvements.

Conclusion: VisGym reveals concrete failure modes in current VLMs and identifies pathways for improving multi-step visual decision-making, highlighting the need for better integration of perception, memory, and action in long-horizon interactive settings.

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain poorly characterized in multi-step visual interactions, particularly in how they integrate perception, memory, and action over long horizons. We introduce VisGym, a gymnasium of 17 environments for evaluating and training VLMs. The suite spans symbolic puzzles, real-image understanding, navigation, and manipulation, and provides flexible controls over difficulty, input representation, planning horizon, and feedback. We also provide multi-step solvers that generate structured demonstrations, enabling supervised finetuning. Our evaluations show that all frontier models struggle in interactive settings, achieving low success rates in both the easy (46.6%) and hard (26.0%) configurations. Our experiments reveal notable limitations: models struggle to effectively leverage long context, performing worse with an unbounded history than with truncated windows. Furthermore, we find that several text-based symbolic tasks become substantially harder once rendered visually. However, explicit goal observations, textual feedback, and exploratory demonstrations in partially observable or unknown-dynamics settings for supervised finetuning yield consistent gains, highlighting concrete failure modes and pathways for improving multi-step visual decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative approaches for single-view relighting struggle with maintaining lighting consistency across multiple views, which is essential for multi-camera broadcasts, stereoscopic cinema, and virtual production workflows.

Method: Uses a multi-view diffusion transformer trained with latent bridge matching formulation on a large-scale hybrid dataset of synthetic environments and real-world multi-view captures under calibrated illumination.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity relighting of entire image sets in a single inference step, generalizes zero-shot to arbitrary number of viewpoints, and effectively propagates lighting changes across all views without requiring camera pose information.

Conclusion: SyncLight enables practical relighting workflows for multi-view capture systems by providing consistent parametric relighting across multiple uncalibrated views, addressing a critical gap in multi-view content production.

Abstract: We present SyncLight, the first method to enable consistent, parametric relighting across multiple uncalibrated views of a static scene. While single-view relighting has advanced significantly, existing generative approaches struggle to maintain the rigorous lighting consistency essential for multi-camera broadcasts, stereoscopic cinema, and virtual production. SyncLight addresses this by enabling precise control over light intensity and color across a multi-view capture of a scene, conditioned on a single reference edit. Our method leverages a multi-view diffusion transformer trained using a latent bridge matching formulation, achieving high-fidelity relighting of the entire image set in a single inference step. To facilitate training, we introduce a large-scale hybrid dataset comprising diverse synthetic environments -- curated from existing sources and newly designed scenes -- alongside high-fidelity, real-world multi-view captures under calibrated illumination. Surprisingly, though trained only on image pairs, SyncLight generalizes zero-shot to an arbitrary number of viewpoints, effectively propagating lighting changes across all views, without requiring camera pose information. SyncLight enables practical relighting workflows for multi-view capture systems.

TL;DR: A screw-theoretic PDE framework for scalable dynamic modeling of serial flexible-link robots with arbitrary number of links, using dual screws to capture rigid motion, undeformed configuration, and elastic deformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a scalable and rigorous dynamic modeling framework for serial robotic manipulators with flexible links that can handle arbitrary numbers of links while capturing both local subsystem dynamics and global system behavior.

Method: Uses screw-theoretic PDE modeling with dual screws in body-fixed coordinates: one for rigid body motion, one for undeformed configuration, and one for elastic deformations. Applies variational principles to derive governing equations, enforces holonomic joint constraints through interaction forces, and formulates as semi-explicit index-1 DAE system.

Result: Creates an infinitely scalable multibody representation that explicitly recovers all dynamic states including body-fixed frame motions and distributed deformation fields. Establishes well-posedness of the system as an abstract Cauchy problem after separation of variables.

Conclusion: The framework provides a mathematically rigorous, scalable approach for dynamic modeling of flexible-link serial manipulators that captures both local and global dynamics while maintaining computational tractability through DAE formulation and well-posedness guarantees.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel and scalable screw-theoretic multibody synthesis framework for PDE-based dynamic modeling of serial robotic manipulators with an arbitrary number of flexible links in three-dimensional space. The proposed approach systematically constructs screw-theoretic PDE models for individual flexible links and rigorously enforces holonomic joint constraints through interaction forces. The dynamics of each link are formulated using a set of dual screws expressed in body-fixed coordinates: one describing the motion of the body-fixed frame relative to the inertial frame, a second relating the body-fixed frame to the undeformed configuration, and a third capturing elastic deformations. By expressing the system energy and applying variational principles, the governing dynamics of each link had been previously derived in a unified manner. Synthesizing the individual link models yields an infinitely scalable multibody representation capable of capturing both local (subsystem-level) and global (system-level) dynamics. The framework explicitly recovers all dynamic states, including the motion of each body-fixed frame and the distributed deformation fields of the flexible links. For computational tractability and mathematical rigor, the resulting governing equations are formulated as a semi-explicit index-1 differential-algebraic system. Furthermore, by applying separation of variables, the PDE model is recast as an abstract Cauchy problem, and well-posedness of the resulting system is established.

Conclusion: The distributed system supports cooperative AVP simulation and provides foundation for future real-world and hardware-in-the-loop validation.

Abstract: This paper presents the DMV-AVP System, a distributed simulation of Multi-Vehicle Autonomous Valet Parking (AVP). The system was implemented as an application of the Distributed Multi-Vehicle Architecture (DMAVA) for synchronized multi-host execution. Most existing simulation approaches rely on centralized or non-distributed designs that constrain scalability and limit fully autonomous control. This work introduces two modules built on top of the DMAVA: 1) a Multi-Vehicle AVP Node that performs state-based coordination, queuing, and reservation management across multiple vehicles, and 2) a Unity-Integrated YOLOv5 Parking Spot Detection Module that provides real-time, vision-based perception within AWSIM Labs. Both modules integrate seamlessly with the DMAVA and extend it specifically for multi-vehicle AVP operation, supported by a Zenoh-based communication layer that ensures low-latency topic synchronization and coordinated behavior across hosts. Experiments conducted on two- and three-host configurations demonstrate deterministic coordination, conflict-free parking behavior, and scalable performance across distributed Autoware instances. The results confirm that the proposed Distributed Multi-Vehicle AVP System supports cooperative AVP simulation and establishes a foundation for future real-world and hardware-in-the-loop validation.

Abstract: This paper presents a terrestrial GNSS-based orbit and clock estimation framework for lunar navigation satellites. To enable high-precision estimation under the low-observability conditions encountered at lunar distances, we develop a stochastic-cloning UD-factorized filter and delayed-state smoother that provide enhanced numerical stability when processing precise time-differenced carrier phase (TDCP) measurements. A comprehensive dynamics and measurement model is formulated, explicitly accounting for relativistic coupling between orbital and clock states, lunar time-scale transformations, and signal propagation delays including ionospheric, plasmaspheric, and Shapiro effects. The proposed approach is evaluated using high-fidelity Monte-Carlo simulations incorporating realistic multi-constellation GNSS geometry, broadcast ephemeris errors, lunar satellite dynamics, and ionospheric and plasmaspheric delay computed from empirical electron density models. Simulation results demonstrate that combining ionosphere-free pseudorange and TDCP measurements achieves meter-level orbit accuracy and sub-millimeter-per-second velocity accuracy, satisfying the stringent signal-in-space error requirements of future Lunar Augmented Navigation Services (LANS).

Conclusion: The SAC-based framework is validated as an effective and scalable solution for energy-constrained coverage path planning in agricultural robotics, demonstrating robust performance under energy limitations.

Abstract: Coverage Path Planning (CPP) is a fundamental capability for agricultural robots; however, existing solutions often overlook energy constraints, resulting in incomplete operations in large-scale or resource-limited environments. This paper proposes an energy-aware CPP framework grounded in Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning, designed for grid-based environments with obstacles and charging stations. To enable robust and adaptive decision-making under energy limitations, the framework integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for spatial feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for temporal dynamics. A dedicated reward function is designed to jointly optimize coverage efficiency, energy consumption, and return-to-base constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently achieves over 90% coverage while ensuring energy safety, outperforming traditional heuristic algorithms such as Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) baselines by 13.4-19.5% in coverage and reducing constraint violations by 59.9-88.3%. These findings validate the proposed SAC-based framework as an effective and scalable solution for energy-constrained CPP in agricultural robotics.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Unified static calibration method for industrial robots that identifies geometric and non-geometric error sources using a single experiment, achieving 26.8μm mean position error vs 102.3μm for geometric-only calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robot calibration methods require separate specialized experiments and models for different error sources (geometric, compliant bending, thermal deformation, gear transmission errors), making calibration complex and time-consuming.

Method: Augments kinematic chain with virtual joints for each modeled effect, uses Gauss-Newton optimization with analytic gradients for parameter identification, requires only a single straightforward experiment for data collection.

Result: Achieved mean position error of 26.8μm on KUKA KR30 industrial robot, significantly better than 102.3μm for purely geometric calibration. Fisher information spectra show well-conditioned estimation and near-minimal parameterization.

Conclusion: Proposed unified calibration approach is accurate, robust, and practical - it handles multiple error sources simultaneously with minimal experimental effort, making industrial robot calibration more efficient and effective.

Abstract: Researchers have identified various sources of tool positioning errors for articulated industrial robots and have proposed dedicated compensation strategies. However, these typically require individual, specialized experiments with separate models and identification procedures. This article presents a unified approach to the static calibration of industrial robots that identifies a robot model, including geometric and non-geometric effects (compliant bending, thermal deformation, gear transmission errors), using only a single, straightforward experiment for data collection. The model augments the kinematic chain with virtual joints for each modeled effect and realizes the identification using Gauss-Newton optimization with analytic gradients. Fisher information spectra show that the estimation is well-conditioned and the parameterization near-minimal, whereas systematic temporal cross-validation and model ablations demonstrate robustness of the model identification. The resulting model is very accurate and its identification robust, achieving a mean position error of 26.8 $μm$ on a KUKA KR30 industrial robot compared to 102.3 $μm$ for purely geometric calibration.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ReViP addresses modality imbalance in VLA models by rebalancing vision-proprioception coupling using task-aware environment priors, reducing false completions and improving robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous VLA models fuse proprioceptive signals directly with vision-language features, causing state-dominant bias and false completions despite visible execution failures due to modality imbalance where policies over-rely on internal state while underusing visual evidence.

Method: ReViP introduces auxiliary task-aware environment priors using an external VLM as task-stage observer to extract real-time task-centric visual cues, which drive Vision-Proprioception Feature-wise Linear Modulation to adaptively modulate coupling between semantic perception and proprioceptive dynamics.

Result: Extensive experiments show ReViP effectively reduces false-completion rates and improves success rates over strong VLA baselines on the proposed False-Completion Benchmark Suite (built on LIBERO with Object-Drop settings), with gains extending to LIBERO, RoboTwin 2.0, and real-world evaluations.

Conclusion: ReViP's vision-proprioception rebalance framework successfully addresses modality imbalance in VLA models, enhancing visual grounding and robustness under perturbations while reducing state-driven errors and false completions across diverse benchmarks and real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced robotic manipulation by combining vision, language, and proprioception to predict actions. However, previous methods fuse proprioceptive signals directly with VLM-encoded vision-language features, resulting in state-dominant bias and false completions despite visible execution failures. We attribute this to modality imbalance, where policies over-rely on internal state while underusing visual evidence. To address this, we present ReViP, a novel VLA framework with Vision-Proprioception Rebalance to enhance visual grounding and robustness under perturbations. The key insight is to introduce auxiliary task-aware environment priors to adaptively modulate the coupling between semantic perception and proprioceptive dynamics. Specifically, we use an external VLM as a task-stage observer to extract real-time task-centric visual cues from visual observations, which drive a Vision-Proprioception Feature-wise Linear Modulation to enhance environmental awareness and reduce state-driven errors. Moreover, to evaluate false completion, we propose the first False-Completion Benchmark Suite built on LIBERO with controlled settings such as Object-Drop. Extensive experiments show that ReViP effectively reduces false-completion rates and improves success rates over strong VLA baselines on our suite, with gains extending to LIBERO, RoboTwin 2.0, and real-world evaluations.

*Lucía Güitta-López,Lionel Güitta-López,Jaime Boal,Álvaro Jesús López-López*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes StyleID-CycleGAN (SICGAN) for zero-shot sim-to-real transfer in DRL, achieving >95% accuracy in real-world robotic pick-and-place without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DRL's sample inefficiency limits industrial adoption due to high real-world training costs. Virtual training is cheaper but suffers from sim-to-real gap, making zero-shot transfer (no real-world tuning) highly desirable for practical efficiency.

Method: Uses Style-Identified Cycle Consistent GAN (SICGAN) to translate virtual observations into real-synthetic images, creating hybrid domain with virtual dynamics and real-like visuals. DRL agents train in this domain then deploy directly to real robots.

Result: Virtual training achieves 90-100% success rates. Real-world deployment shows >95% accuracy for most workspace regions with zero-shot transfer. Agents generalize to real objects of varying colors/shapes (LEGO cubes, mug) using augmented reality for evaluation.

Conclusion: SICGAN pipeline provides efficient, scalable solution to sim-to-real problem, enabling robust zero-shot transfer for industrial robotics without costly real-world training.

Abstract: The sample efficiency challenge in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) compromises its industrial adoption due to the high cost and time demands of real-world training. Virtual environments offer a cost-effective alternative for training DRL agents, but the transfer of learned policies to real setups is hindered by the sim-to-real gap. Achieving zero-shot transfer, where agents perform directly in real environments without additional tuning, is particularly desirable for its efficiency and practical value. This work proposes a novel domain adaptation approach relying on a Style-Identified Cycle Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (StyleID-CycleGAN or SICGAN), an original Cycle Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) based model. SICGAN translates raw virtual observations into real-synthetic images, creating a hybrid domain for training DRL agents that combines virtual dynamics with real-like visual inputs. Following virtual training, the agent can be directly deployed, bypassing the need for real-world training. The pipeline is validated with two distinct industrial robots in the approaching phase of a pick-and-place operation. In virtual environments agents achieve success rates of 90 to 100\%, and real-world deployment confirms robust zero-shot transfer (i.e., without additional training in the physical environment) with accuracies above 95\% for most workspace regions. We use augmented reality targets to improve the evaluation process efficiency, and experimentally demonstrate that the agent successfully generalizes to real objects of varying colors and shapes, including LEGO\textsuperscript{\textregistered}~cubes and a mug. These results establish the proposed pipeline as an efficient, scalable solution to the sim-to-real problem.

TL;DR: ARMS: Hybrid learning-control framework for human-guided robot navigation combining RL follower with MPC safety filter, using adaptive neural switcher for context-aware control fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenge of human-guided navigation for mobile collaborative robots under simultaneous proximity regulation and safety constraints, requiring robust perception under partial observability and non-stationary human motion.

Method: ARMS integrates RL follower trained with PPO and analytical one-step MPC safety filter. Uses decoupled sensing with LSTM temporal encoder for human-robot state and spatial encoder for LiDAR scans. Core innovation is learned adaptive neural switcher for context-aware soft action fusion between controllers.

Result: Achieves 82.5% success rate in highly cluttered environments, outperforming DWA and RL-only by 7.1% and 3.1% respectively. Reduces computational latency by 33% to 5.2ms compared to multi-step MPC baseline. Simulation and real-world tests demonstrate practicality.

Conclusion: ARMS provides safe, efficient human-robot collaboration through adaptive hybrid control, balancing safety constraints with maneuverability in complex environments while maintaining low computational overhead.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of human-guided navigation for mobile collaborative robots under simultaneous proximity regulation and safety constraints. We introduce Adaptive Reinforcement and Model Predictive Control Switching (ARMS), a hybrid learning-control framework that integrates a reinforcement learning follower trained with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and an analytical one-step Model Predictive Control (MPC) formulated as a quadratic program safety filter. To enable robust perception under partial observability and non-stationary human motion, ARMS employs a decoupled sensing architecture with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) temporal encoder for the human-robot relative state and a spatial encoder for 360-degree LiDAR scans. The core contribution is a learned adaptive neural switcher that performs context-aware soft action fusion between the two controllers, favoring conservative, constraint-aware QP-based control in low-risk regions while progressively shifting control authority to the learned follower in highly cluttered or constrained scenarios where maneuverability is critical, and reverting to the follower action when the QP becomes infeasible. Extensive evaluations against Pure Pursuit, Dynamic Window Approach (DWA), and an RL-only baseline demonstrate that ARMS achieves an 82.5 percent success rate in highly cluttered environments, outperforming DWA and RL-only approaches by 7.1 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively, while reducing average computational latency by 33 percent to 5.2 milliseconds compared to a multi-step MPC baseline. Additional simulation transfer in Gazebo and initial real-world deployment results further indicate the practicality and robustness of ARMS for safe and efficient human-robot collaboration.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Researchers developed an improved eight-legged spider robot with more biologically accurate leg morphology and deeper crouching capability to study how spiders use leg movements to enhance vibration sensing on webs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how orb-weaving spiders enhance prey detection through leg crouching behaviors, which is difficult to study in live animals due to challenges in measuring system vibrations during behavior.

Method: Developed a new eight-legged spider robot with four joints per leg that better approximates spider leg morphology, using 3D-printed exoskeletons, silicone molding for joint stiffness tuning, and tendon-driven actuation for deep crouching. Accelerometers at leg joints recorded vibrations.

Result: The new spider robot reproduced key vibration features from previous models while improving biological accuracy, providing a more realistic robophysical model for studying vibration sensing modulation.

Conclusion: The improved spider robot offers a biologically more accurate platform for investigating how leg behaviors like crouching modulate vibration sensing on webs, advancing understanding of spider prey detection strategies.

Abstract: Orb-weaving spiders detect prey on a web using vibration sensors at leg joints. They often dynamically crouch their legs during prey sensing, likely an active sensing strategy. However, how leg crouching enhances sensing is poorly understood, because measuring system vibrations in behaving animals is difficult. We use robophysical modeling to study this problem. Our previous spider robot had only four legs, simplified leg morphology, and a shallow crouching range of motion. Here, we developed a new spider robot, with eight legs, each with four joints that better approximated spider leg morphology. Leg exoskeletons were 3-D printed and joint stiffness was tuned using integrated silicone molding with variable materials and geometry. Tendon-driven actuation allowed a motor in the body to crouch all eight legs deeply as spiders do, while accelerometers at leg joints record leg vibrations. Experiments showed that our new spider robot reproduced key vibration features observed in the previous robot while improving biological accuracy. Our new robot provides a biologically more accurate robophysical model for studying how leg behaviors modulate vibration sensing on a web.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate joint torque prediction is essential for personalized robot-assisted rehabilitation, but current methods may be complex or require extensive data.

Method: 8-channel sEMG feature extraction pipeline integrated with MLP and TCN models; data collected from single subject performing movements under three load conditions using motion capture; reference torques estimated from center-of-mass kinematics assuming static equilibrium.

Result: MLP achieved mean RMSE of 0.963 N m (elbow), 1.403 N m (front-shoulder), 1.434 N m (side-shoulder), comparable to TCN performance despite TCN's explicit temporal dependency design.

Conclusion: The feature extraction pipeline enables simple MLP to achieve performance comparable to temporal networks, making it particularly suitable for applications with limited training data like patient care.

Abstract: Robot-assisted rehabilitation offers an effective approach, wherein exoskeletons adapt to users' needs and provide personalized assistance. However, to deliver such assistance, accurate prediction of the user's joint torques is essential. In this work, we propose a feature extraction pipeline using 8-channel surface electromyography (sEMG) signals to predict elbow and shoulder joint torques. For preliminary evaluation, this pipeline was integrated into two neural network models: the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). Data were collected from a single subject performing elbow and shoulder movements under three load conditions (0 kg, 1.10 kg, and 1.85 kg) using three motion-capture cameras. Reference torques were estimated from center-of-mass kinematics under the assumption of static equilibrium. Our offline analyses showed that, with our feature extraction pipeline, MLP model achieved mean RMSE of 0.963 N m, 1.403 N m, and 1.434 N m (over five seeds) for elbow, front-shoulder, and side-shoulder joints, respectively, which were comparable to the TCN performance. These results demonstrate that the proposed feature extraction pipeline enables a simple MLP to achieve performance comparable to that of a network designed explicitly for temporal dependencies. This finding is particularly relevant for applications with limited training data, a common scenario patient care.

Result: 60% reduction in learning time, ~15 percentage point improvement in task accuracy, no increase in training time or computational complexity in robotic manipulator experiments.

Conclusion: Semantic knowledge integration via KGEs effectively reduces DRL sample complexity and improves robotic learning efficiency without computational overhead.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a powerful framework for solving complex sequential decision-making problems, particularly in robotic control. However, its practical deployment is often hindered by the substantial amount of experience required for learning, which results in high computational and time costs. In this work, we propose a novel integration of DRL with semantic knowledge in the form of Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs), aiming to enhance learning efficiency by providing contextual information to the agent. Our architecture combines KGEs with visual observations, enabling the agent to exploit environmental knowledge during training. Experimental validation with robotic manipulators in environments featuring both fixed and randomized target attributes demonstrates that our method achieves up to {60}{\%} reduction in learning time and improves task accuracy by approximately 15 percentage points, without increasing training time or computational complexity. These results highlight the potential of semantic knowledge to reduce sample complexity and improve the effectiveness of DRL in robotic applications.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates suitability for scaling to larger datasets for learning, benchmarking, and evaluation of ambiguity-aware assistive control in wheelchair-mounted robotic arm systems.

Abstract: Integrated control of wheelchairs and wheelchair-mounted robotic arms (WMRAs) has strong potential to increase independence for users with severe motor limitations, yet existing interfaces often lack the flexibility needed for intuitive assistive interaction. Although data-driven AI methods show promise, progress is limited by the lack of multimodal datasets that capture natural Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), particularly conversational ambiguity in dialogue-driven control. To address this gap, we propose a multimodal data collection framework that employs a dialogue-based interaction protocol and a two-room Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) setup to simulate robot autonomy while eliciting natural user behavior. The framework records five synchronized modalities: RGB-D video, conversational audio, inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals, end-effector Cartesian pose, and whole-body joint states across five assistive tasks. Using this framework, we collected a pilot dataset of 53 trials from five participants and validated its quality through motion smoothness analysis and user feedback. The results show that the framework effectively captures diverse ambiguity types and supports natural dialogue-driven interaction, demonstrating its suitability for scaling to a larger dataset for learning, benchmarking, and evaluation of ambiguity-aware assistive control.

Through systematic evaluation of 1,980 deterministic test instances spanning both open-weight models (Qwen2.5 series, Functionary) and proprietary alternatives (GPT-4, Claude 3.5/3.7) across diverse edge hardware configurations, we identify actionable reliability thresholds for production deployment. Our analysis reveals that procedural reliability, particularly tool initialization failures, constitutes the primary bottleneck for smaller models, while qwen2.5:32b achieves flawless performance matching GPT-4.1. The framework demonstrates that mid-sized models (qwen2.5:14b) offer practical accuracy-efficiency trade-offs on commodity hardware (96.6\% success rate, 7.3 s latency), enabling cost-effective intelligent agent deployment for resource-constrained organizations. This work establishes foundational infrastructure for systematic reliability evaluation of tool-augmented multi-agent AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SemanticALLI introduces pipeline-aware caching for agentic AI by decomposing generation into structured intermediate representations, achieving 83% cache hit rates vs 39% with monolithic caching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic AI pipelines waste resources by repeatedly reconstructing identical intermediate logic (like metric normalization or chart scaffolding) even when user phrasing varies, because conventional caching treats inference as a monolithic black box.

Method: SemanticALLI decomposes generation into two stages: Analytic Intent Resolution (AIR) and Visualization Synthesis (VS), elevating structured intermediate representations (IRs) to first-class, cacheable artifacts within the pipeline architecture.

Result: The structured approach achieved 83.10% cache hit rate in Visualization Synthesis stage (vs 38.7% with monolithic caching), bypassing 4,023 LLM calls with median latency of 2.66 ms, significantly reducing token consumption.

Conclusion: Even when users rarely repeat themselves, AI pipelines often repeat identical structured logic at stable checkpoints, making structured intermediate representations a practical caching strategy for efficient AI system design.

Abstract: Agentic AI pipelines suffer from a hidden inefficiency: they frequently reconstruct identical intermediate logic, such as metric normalization or chart scaffolding, even when the user's natural language phrasing is entirely novel. Conventional boundary caching fails to capture this inefficiency because it treats inference as a monolithic black box.
  We introduce SemanticALLI, a pipeline-aware architecture within Alli (PMG's marketing intelligence platform), designed to operationalize redundant reasoning. By decomposing generation into Analytic Intent Resolution (AIR) and Visualization Synthesis (VS), SemanticALLI elevates structured intermediate representations (IRs) to first-class, cacheable artifacts.
  The impact of caching within the agentic loop is substantial. In our evaluation, baseline monolithic caching caps at a 38.7% hit rate due to linguistic variance. In contrast, our structured approach allows for an additional stage, the Visualization Synthesis stage, to achieve an 83.10% hit rate, bypassing 4,023 LLM calls with a median latency of just 2.66 ms. This internal reuse reduces total token consumption, offering a practical lesson for AI system design: even when users rarely repeat themselves, the pipeline often does, at stable, structured checkpoints where caching is most reliable.

TL;DR: DSGym is a standardized framework for evaluating and training data science agents with realistic data grounding, addressing limitations of existing fragmented benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data science benchmarks have fragmented evaluation interfaces, narrow task coverage, and lack rigorous data grounding, with many tasks solvable without actual data.

Method: Introduces DSGym framework with modular architecture for adding tasks, agent scaffolds, and tools; includes DSGym-Tasks suite with quality filtering, DSBio (bioinformatics tasks), and DSPredict (prediction tasks); enables agent training via execution-verified data synthesis.

Result: Built a 2,000-example training set and trained a 4B model that outperforms GPT-4o on standardized analysis benchmarks.

Conclusion: DSGym enables rigorous end-to-end measurement of whether agents can plan, implement, and validate data analyses in realistic scientific contexts, serving as an extensible testbed for data science agent development.

Abstract: Data science agents promise to accelerate discovery and insight-generation by turning data into executable analyses and findings. Yet existing data science benchmarks fall short due to fragmented evaluation interfaces that make cross-benchmark comparison difficult, narrow task coverage and a lack of rigorous data grounding. In particular, we show that a substantial portion of tasks in current benchmarks can be solved without using the actual data. To address these limitations, we introduce DSGym, a standardized framework for evaluating and training data science agents in self-contained execution environments. Unlike static benchmarks, DSGym provides a modular architecture that makes it easy to add tasks, agent scaffolds, and tools, positioning it as a live, extensible testbed. We curate DSGym-Tasks, a holistic task suite that standardizes and refines existing benchmarks via quality and shortcut solvability filtering. We further expand coverage with (1) DSBio: expert-derived bioinformatics tasks grounded in literature and (2) DSPredict: challenging prediction tasks spanning domains such as computer vision, molecular prediction, and single-cell perturbation. Beyond evaluation, DSGym enables agent training via execution-verified data synthesis pipeline. As a case study, we build a 2,000-example training set and trained a 4B model in DSGym that outperforms GPT-4o on standardized analysis benchmarks. Overall, DSGym enables rigorous end-to-end measurement of whether agents can plan, implement, and validate data analyses in realistic scientific context.

*Hongjia Wu,Shuai Zhou,Hongxin Zhang,Wei Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Doc2AHP bridges LLMs with decision theory by using AHP principles to guide LLMs in constructing structured decision models from unstructured documents without expert intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with structural consistency in complex decision-making, while classical decision theories like AHP require labor-intensive domain expertise, creating an "expert bottleneck" that limits scalability.

Method: Proposes Doc2AHP framework that uses AHP structural principles as constraints to guide LLMs in constrained search within unstructured documents, with multi-agent weighting mechanism and adaptive consistency optimization for weight allocation.

Result: Empirical results show Doc2AHP enables non-experts to construct high-quality decision models from scratch and significantly outperforms direct generative baselines in logical completeness and downstream task accuracy.

Conclusion: Doc2AHP successfully bridges the gap between LLM generalization capabilities and decision theory rigor, eliminating expert bottlenecks while ensuring structural and numerical consistency in decision modeling.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable proficiency in semantic understanding, they often struggle to ensure structural consistency and reasoning reliability in complex decision-making tasks that demand rigorous logic. Although classical decision theories, such as the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), offer systematic rational frameworks, their construction relies heavily on labor-intensive domain expertise, creating an "expert bottleneck" that hinders scalability in general scenarios. To bridge the gap between the generalization capabilities of LLMs and the rigor of decision theory, we propose Doc2AHP, a novel structured inference framework guided by AHP principles. Eliminating the need for extensive annotated data or manual intervention, our approach leverages the structural principles of AHP as constraints to direct the LLM in a constrained search within the unstructured document space, thereby enforcing the logical entailment between parent and child nodes. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-agent weighting mechanism coupled with an adaptive consistency optimization strategy to ensure the numerical consistency of weight allocation. Empirical results demonstrate that Doc2AHP not only empowers non-expert users to construct high-quality decision models from scratch but also significantly outperforms direct generative baselines in both logical completeness and downstream task accuracy.

TL;DR: LLMs in clinical settings are vulnerable to patient persuasion for inappropriate care, with acquiescence rates varying widely across models and scenarios, highlighting the need for adversarial testing beyond static benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs show promise for clinical decision support, they risk acquiescing to patient pressure for inappropriate care, creating safety concerns that static benchmarks fail to capture.

Method: Developed SycoEval-EM, a multi-agent simulation framework using adversarial patient persuasion in emergency medicine scenarios. Tested 20 LLMs across 1,875 encounters covering three Choosing Wisely scenarios.

Result: Acquiescence rates ranged from 0-100% across models. Models were more vulnerable to imaging requests (38.8%) than opioid prescriptions (25.0%). All persuasion tactics were equally effective (30.0-36.0%), indicating general susceptibility rather than tactic-specific weakness.

Conclusion: Static benchmarks inadequately predict LLM safety under social pressure. Multi-turn adversarial testing is necessary for clinical AI certification to ensure robustness against patient persuasion.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in clinical decision support yet risk acquiescing to patient pressure for inappropriate care. We introduce SycoEval-EM, a multi-agent simulation framework evaluating LLM robustness through adversarial patient persuasion in emergency medicine. Across 20 LLMs and 1,875 encounters spanning three Choosing Wisely scenarios, acquiescence rates ranged from 0-100\%. Models showed higher vulnerability to imaging requests (38.8\%) than opioid prescriptions (25.0\%), with model capability poorly predicting robustness. All persuasion tactics proved equally effective (30.0-36.0\%), indicating general susceptibility rather than tactic-specific weakness. Our findings demonstrate that static benchmarks inadequately predict safety under social pressure, necessitating multi-turn adversarial testing for clinical AI certification.

*Meet Raval,Tejul Pandit,Dhvani Upadhyay*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Traditional ML models outperform modern LLMs/VLMs in medical classification tasks, with fine-tuned models performing worst and zero-shot models showing mixed results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To benchmark traditional ML against modern transformer-based approaches (LLMs/VLMs) for medical classification across text and image modalities, assessing whether foundation models truly offer superior performance in this domain.

Method: Used four public datasets covering text/image modalities with binary/multiclass complexity. Compared three model classes: Classical ML (LR, LightGBM, ResNet-50), Prompt-Based LLMs/VLMs (Gemini 2.5), and Fine-Tuned PEFT Models (LoRA-adapted Gemma3 variants) with consistent data splits and aligned metrics.

Result: Traditional ML consistently achieved best performance, especially on structured text datasets. LoRA-tuned Gemma variants performed worst across all tasks. Zero-shot Gemini 2.5 performed poorly on text tasks but matched ResNet-50 on multiclass image classification.

Conclusion: Established ML models remain most reliable for medical categorization; foundation models aren't universally superior, and PEFT effectiveness depends heavily on adaptation strategy, with minimal fine-tuning proving detrimental.

Abstract: The combination of multimodal Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) opens up new possibilities for medical classification. This work offers a rigorous, unified benchmark by using four publicly available datasets covering text and image modalities (binary and multiclass complexity) that contrasts traditional Machine Learning (ML) with contemporary transformer-based techniques. We evaluated three model classes for each task: Classical ML (LR, LightGBM, ResNet-50), Prompt-Based LLMs/VLMs (Gemini 2.5), and Fine-Tuned PEFT Models (LoRA-adapted Gemma3 variants). All experiments used consistent data splits and aligned metrics. According to our results, traditional machine learning (ML) models set a high standard by consistently achieving the best overall performance across most medical categorization tasks. This was especially true for structured text-based datasets, where the classical models performed exceptionally well. In stark contrast, the LoRA-tuned Gemma variants consistently showed the worst performance across all text and image experiments, failing to generalize from the minimal fine-tuning provided. However, the zero-shot LLM/VLM pipelines (Gemini 2.5) had mixed results; they performed poorly on text-based tasks, but demonstrated competitive performance on the multiclass image task, matching the classical ResNet-50 baseline. These results demonstrate that in many medical categorization scenarios, established machine learning models continue to be the most reliable option. The experiment suggests that foundation models are not universally superior and that the effectiveness of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is highly dependent on the adaptation strategy, as minimal fine-tuning proved detrimental in this study.

TL;DR: Researchers developed an oracle counterfactual framework to measure the importance of different AI skills (planning, state tracking, etc.) for multi-turn agentic tasks, using procedurally generated game-like environments to isolate skill contributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with multi-turn, long-horizon agentic problems requiring planning, state tracking, and long context processing. The paper aims to understand which underlying capabilities are most critical for success on such tasks.

Method: Developed an oracle counterfactual framework that measures agent performance when given perfect assistance on specific skills. Created procedurally generated, game-like tasks with tunable complexity to provide precise oracle interventions (perfect planning, flawless state tracking) without confounding effects.

Result: Planning interventions consistently improved performance across settings, but the usefulness of other skills depended on environment properties and language model characteristics.

Conclusion: The work provides insights into the challenges of multi-turn agentic environments and guides future development of AI agents and language models by identifying which skills are most critical for different types of tasks.

Abstract: Large language models can perform well on many isolated tasks, yet they continue to struggle on multi-turn, long-horizon agentic problems that require skills such as planning, state tracking, and long context processing. In this work, we aim to better understand the relative importance of advancing these underlying capabilities for success on such tasks. We develop an oracle counterfactual framework for multi-turn problems that asks: how would an agent perform if it could leverage an oracle to perfectly perform a specific task? The change in the agent's performance due to this oracle assistance allows us to measure the criticality of such oracle skill in the future advancement of AI agents. We introduce a suite of procedurally generated, game-like tasks with tunable complexity. These controlled environments allow us to provide precise oracle interventions, such as perfect planning or flawless state tracking, and make it possible to isolate the contribution of each oracle without confounding effects present in real-world benchmarks. Our results show that while some interventions (e.g., planning) consistently improve performance across settings, the usefulness of other skills is dependent on the properties of the environment and language model. Our work sheds light on the challenges of multi-turn agentic environments to guide the future efforts in the development of AI agents and language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for medical imaging reports fail to capture structured diagnostic logic, leading to unreliable judgments and limited clinical relevance.

Method: Multi-agent stream reasoning framework that divides evaluation into interpretable steps: criteria definition, evidence extraction, alignment, and consistency scoring.

Result: AgentsEval delivers clinically aligned, semantically faithful, and interpretable evaluations that remain robust under paraphrastic, semantic, and stylistic perturbations.

Conclusion: The framework represents a step toward transparent and clinically grounded assessment of medical report generation systems, fostering trustworthy integration of large language models into clinical practice.

Abstract: Evaluating the clinical correctness and reasoning fidelity of automatically generated medical imaging reports remains a critical yet unresolved challenge. Existing evaluation methods often fail to capture the structured diagnostic logic that underlies radiological interpretation, resulting in unreliable judgments and limited clinical relevance. We introduce AgentsEval, a multi-agent stream reasoning framework that emulates the collaborative diagnostic workflow of radiologists. By dividing the evaluation process into interpretable steps including criteria definition, evidence extraction, alignment, and consistency scoring, AgentsEval provides explicit reasoning traces and structured clinical feedback. We also construct a multi-domain perturbation-based benchmark covering five medical report datasets with diverse imaging modalities and controlled semantic variations. Experimental results demonstrate that AgentsEval delivers clinically aligned, semantically faithful, and interpretable evaluations that remain robust under paraphrastic, semantic, and stylistic perturbations. This framework represents a step toward transparent and clinically grounded assessment of medical report generation systems, fostering trustworthy integration of large language models into clinical practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a superior open-source reasoning model with strong agentic capabilities that can handle complex tool interactions and noisy real-world environments, addressing limitations in current open-source models for agentic tasks.

Method: Unified training framework combining domain-parallel expert training with fusion, systematic environment scaling (10,000+ environments across 20+ domains), extended DORA asynchronous RL for stable multi-environment training, principled task construction, noise pattern analysis with targeted training, and Heavy Thinking mode for test-time scaling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models on agentic benchmarks (search, tool use, tool-integrated reasoning), demonstrates strong generalization to complex tool interactions and robust behavior in noisy real-world environments.

Conclusion: LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601 represents a significant advancement in open-source reasoning models, combining comprehensive training methodologies with novel architectural features to deliver superior agentic capabilities suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: We introduce LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601, a 560-billion-parameter open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) reasoning model with superior agentic reasoning capability. LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models on a wide range of agentic benchmarks, including agentic search, agentic tool use, and tool-integrated reasoning. Beyond benchmark performance, the model demonstrates strong generalization to complex tool interactions and robust behavior under noisy real-world environments. Its advanced capability stems from a unified training framework that combines domain-parallel expert training with subsequent fusion, together with an end-to-end co-design of data construction, environments, algorithms, and infrastructure spanning from pre-training to post-training. In particular, the model's strong generalization capability in complex tool-use are driven by our in-depth exploration of environment scaling and principled task construction. To optimize long-tailed, skewed generation and multi-turn agentic interactions, and to enable stable training across over 10,000 environments spanning more than 20 domains, we systematically extend our asynchronous reinforcement learning framework, DORA, for stable and efficient large-scale multi-environment training. Furthermore, recognizing that real-world tasks are inherently noisy, we conduct a systematic analysis and decomposition of real-world noise patterns, and design targeted training procedures to explicitly incorporate such imperfections into the training process, resulting in improved robustness for real-world applications. To further enhance performance on complex reasoning tasks, we introduce a Heavy Thinking mode that enables effective test-time scaling by jointly expanding reasoning depth and width through intensive parallel thinking.

Motivation: To develop a biologically-inspired navigation agent that mimics insect capabilities for learning and refining visually guided paths around obstacles between food sources and nests, addressing the computational inefficiency of current SOTA models.

Method: Combines abstracted models of two insect brain structures (associative learning and path integration) to create a novel agent for the Habitat point-goal navigation task, drawing analogies between formal benchmarks and insect navigation behaviors.

Result: The insect-inspired agent achieves performance comparable to recent SOTA models while requiring many orders of magnitude less computational cost, and demonstrates robustness to perturbations in more realistic simulated environments.

Conclusion: Biologically-inspired approaches from insect navigation can provide highly efficient and robust solutions for visual point-goal navigation tasks, offering dramatic computational savings while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: In this work we develop a novel insect-inspired agent for visual point-goal navigation. This combines abstracted models of two insect brain structures that have been implicated, respectively, in associative learning and path integration. We draw an analogy between the formal benchmark of the Habitat point-goal navigation task and the ability of insects to learn and refine visually guided paths around obstacles between a discovered food location and their nest. We demonstrate that the simple insect-inspired agent exhibits performance comparable to recent SOTA models at many orders of magnitude less computational cost. Testing in a more realistic simulated environment shows the approach is robust to perturbations.

TL;DR: Reasoning-oriented LLMs show improved robustness in Theory of Mind tasks, but gains appear due to better solution-finding rather than fundamentally new social-cognitive capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether reasoning-oriented LLMs trained with verifiable rewards (RLVR) demonstrate fundamentally new Theory of Mind capabilities or simply improved robustness in existing tasks, given ongoing debates about LLMs' true social-cognitive abilities.

Method: Used novel adaptations of machine psychological experiments and established benchmarks to examine reasoning models' behavior in Theory of Mind tasks, analyzing their robustness to prompt variations and task perturbations.

Result: Reasoning models consistently showed increased robustness to prompt variations and task perturbations, but analysis suggests gains are more likely due to improved robustness in finding correct solutions rather than fundamentally new forms of ToM reasoning.

Conclusion: The observed improvements in reasoning models' ToM performance appear to stem from enhanced robustness in solution-finding rather than novel social-cognitive capabilities, with important implications for how we evaluate social-cognitive behavior in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong performance on Theory of Mind (ToM) tests, prompting debate about the nature and true performance of the underlying capabilities. At the same time, reasoning-oriented LLMs trained via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) have achieved notable improvements across a range of benchmarks. This paper examines the behavior of such reasoning models in ToM tasks, using novel adaptations of machine psychological experiments and results from established benchmarks. We observe that reasoning models consistently exhibit increased robustness to prompt variations and task perturbations. Our analysis indicates that the observed gains are more plausibly attributed to increased robustness in finding the correct solution, rather than to fundamentally new forms of ToM reasoning. We discuss the implications of this interpretation for evaluating social-cognitive behavior in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of static Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures and enable small model ensembles to achieve performance comparable to large models while improving computational efficiency and safety alignment.

Method: Dynamic Expertise Broker treats model selection as Knapsack Problem; Macro-Scale RNN with semantic forget gate for iterative refinement; orchestration fabric for peer review; Quadratic Voting for consensus; feedback-driven state updates.

Result: Ensembles of small (<20B) models match/exceed 100B+ parameter models on AIME 2025 and LiveCodeBench; reduces sycophancy scores on DarkBench safety suite below individual agents.

Conclusion: NSED establishes new hardware arbitrage efficiency frontier and demonstrates intrinsic alignment properties through peer-mediated correction, enabling high performance with smaller models.

Abstract: This paper introduces the N-Way Self-Evaluating Deliberation (NSED) protocol, a Runtime Mixture-of-Models (MoM) architecture that constructs emergent composite models from a plurality of distinct expert agents. Unlike traditional Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) which rely on static gating networks, NSED employs a Dynamic Expertise Broker - a runtime optimization engine that treats model selection as a variation of the Knapsack Problem, binding heterogeneous checkpoints to functional roles based on live telemetry and cost constraints. At the execution layer, we formalize deliberation as a Macro-Scale Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), where the consensus state loops back through a semantic forget gate to enable iterative refinement without proportional VRAM scaling. Key components include an orchestration fabric for trustless N-to-N peer review, a Quadratic Voting activation function for non-linear consensus, and a feedback-driven state update. Empirical validation on challenging benchmarks (AIME 2025, LiveCodeBench) demonstrates that this topology allows ensembles of small (less than 20B) consumer-grade models to match or exceed the performance of state-of-the-art 100B+ parameter models, establishing a new hardware arbitrage efficiency frontier. Furthermore, testing on the DarkBench safety suite reveals intrinsic alignment properties, with peer-mediated correction reducing sycophancy scores below that of any individual agent.

TL;DR: MAGE-KT is a multi-agent graph-enhanced knowledge tracing framework that improves student performance prediction by better modeling inter-concept relations and avoiding attention diffusion in large heterogeneous graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based KT methods insufficiently explore inter-concept relations (often inferred only from interaction sequences) and suffer from computational inefficiency and noise in full-graph encoding, causing attention to bleed into irrelevant regions and degrading inter-KC relation fidelity.

Method: Constructs multi-view heterogeneous graph using multi-agent KC relation extractor and student-question interaction graph; retrieves compact subgraphs conditioned on target student's history; integrates them using Asymmetric Cross-attention Fusion Module to avoid attention diffusion.

Result: Experiments on three widely used KT datasets show substantial improvements in KC-relation accuracy and clear gains in next-question prediction over existing methods.

Conclusion: MAGE-KT effectively addresses limitations of existing graph-based KT methods by better capturing inter-concept relations while avoiding computational inefficiency and attention diffusion through selective subgraph retrieval and asymmetric fusion.

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to model a student's learning trajectory and predict performance on the next question. A key challenge is how to better represent the relationships among students, questions, and knowledge concepts (KCs). Recently, graph-based KT paradigms have shown promise for this problem. However, existing methods have not sufficiently explored inter-concept relations, often inferred solely from interaction sequences. In addition, the scale and heterogeneity of KT graphs make full-graph encoding both computationally both costly and noise-prone, causing attention to bleed into student-irrelevant regions and degrading the fidelity of inter-KC relations. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework: Multi-Agent Graph-Enhanced Knowledge Tracing (MAGE-KT). It constructs a multi-view heterogeneous graph by combining a multi-agent KC relation extractor and a student-question interaction graph, capturing complementary semantic and behavioral signals. Conditioned on the target student's history, it retrieves compact, high-value subgraphs and integrates them using an Asymmetric Cross-attention Fusion Module to enhance prediction while avoiding attention diffusion and irrelevant computation. Experiments on three widely used KT datasets show substantial improvements in KC-relation accuracy and clear gains in next-question prediction over existing methods.

### [82] [Preventing the Collapse of Peer Review Requires Verification-First AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16909)
*Lei You,Lele Cao,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI peer review should focus on verifying truth rather than mimicking human review, using AI as adversarial auditor to prevent proxy optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-assisted peer review risks amplifying proxy optimization instead of truth-seeking, especially when verification capacity can't keep up with claims and real improvements become hard to distinguish from noise.

Method: Propose truth-coupling as objective, formalize verification pressure and signal shrinkage forces, develop minimal model with high-fidelity checks and proxy judgments, derive coupling law and incentive-collapse condition.

Result: Identifies phase transition to proxy-sovereign evaluation where rational effort shifts from truth-seeking to proxy optimization even when decisions appear reliable.

Conclusion: Tool builders and program chairs should deploy AI as adversarial auditor generating verification artifacts to expand verification bandwidth, not as score predictor that amplifies claim inflation.

Abstract: This paper argues that AI-assisted peer review should be verification-first rather than review-mimicking. We propose truth-coupling, i.e. how tightly venue scores track latent scientific truth, as the right objective for review tools. We formalize two forces that drive a phase transition toward proxy-sovereign evaluation: verification pressure, when claims outpace verification capacity, and signal shrinkage, when real improvements become hard to separate from noise. In a minimal model that mixes occasional high-fidelity checks with frequent proxy judgment, we derive an explicit coupling law and an incentive-collapse condition under which rational effort shifts from truth-seeking to proxy optimization, even when current decisions still appear reliable. These results motivate actions for tool builders and program chairs: deploy AI as an adversarial auditor that generates auditable verification artifacts and expands effective verification bandwidth, rather than as a score predictor that amplifies claim inflation.

Conclusion: AgentDrive provides a much-needed standardized benchmark for autonomous agent evaluation, enabling systematic training and assessment across diverse driving scenarios and reasoning dimensions, with open models showing promising progress in certain reasoning areas.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has sparked growing interest in their integration into autonomous systems for reasoning-driven perception, planning, and decision-making. However, evaluating and training such agentic AI models remains challenging due to the lack of large-scale, structured, and safety-critical benchmarks. This paper introduces AgentDrive, an open benchmark dataset containing 300,000 LLM-generated driving scenarios designed for training, fine-tuning, and evaluating autonomous agents under diverse conditions. AgentDrive formalizes a factorized scenario space across seven orthogonal axes: scenario type, driver behavior, environment, road layout, objective, difficulty, and traffic density. An LLM-driven prompt-to-JSON pipeline generates semantically rich, simulation-ready specifications that are validated against physical and schema constraints. Each scenario undergoes simulation rollouts, surrogate safety metric computation, and rule-based outcome labeling. To complement simulation-based evaluation, we introduce AgentDrive-MCQ, a 100,000-question multiple-choice benchmark spanning five reasoning dimensions: physics, policy, hybrid, scenario, and comparative reasoning. We conduct a large-scale evaluation of fifty leading LLMs on AgentDrive-MCQ. Results show that while proprietary frontier models perform best in contextual and policy reasoning, advanced open models are rapidly closing the gap in structured and physics-grounded reasoning. We release the AgentDrive dataset, AgentDrive-MCQ benchmark, evaluation code, and related materials at https://github.com/maferrag/AgentDrive

*Riyang Bao,Cheng Yang,Dazhou Yu,Zhexiang Tang,Gengchen Mai,Liang Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Spatial-Agent is an AI agent that formalizes geospatial question answering as concept transformation using GeoFlow Graphs, outperforming existing LLM-based methods on geospatial reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based agents fail at genuine geospatial computation, relying on web search or pattern matching while hallucinating spatial relationships, despite geospatial reasoning being essential for real-world applications like urban analytics and disaster response.

Method: Formalizes geo-analytical question answering as a concept transformation problem, parsing natural-language questions into executable workflows represented as GeoFlow Graphs (directed acyclic graphs). Uses spatial information theory to extract spatial concepts, assign functional roles with ordering constraints, and compose transformation sequences through template-based generation.

Result: Extensive experiments on MapEval-API and MapQA benchmarks show Spatial-Agent significantly outperforms existing baselines including ReAct and Reflexion, while producing interpretable and executable geospatial workflows.

Conclusion: Spatial-Agent provides a principled approach to geospatial reasoning grounded in spatial information science, addressing the limitations of current LLM-based agents and enabling genuine geospatial computation for practical applications.

Abstract: Geospatial reasoning is essential for real-world applications such as urban analytics, transportation planning, and disaster response. However, existing LLM-based agents often fail at genuine geospatial computation, relying instead on web search or pattern matching while hallucinating spatial relationships. We present Spatial-Agent, an AI agent grounded in foundational theories of spatial information science. Our approach formalizes geo-analytical question answering as a concept transformation problem, where natural-language questions are parsed into executable workflows represented as GeoFlow Graphs -- directed acyclic graphs with nodes corresponding to spatial concepts and edges representing transformations. Drawing on spatial information theory, Spatial-Agent extracts spatial concepts, assigns functional roles with principled ordering constraints, and composes transformation sequences through template-based generation. Extensive experiments on MapEval-API and MapQA benchmarks demonstrate that Spatial-Agent significantly outperforms existing baselines including ReAct and Reflexion, while producing interpretable and executable geospatial workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical equipment in LMICs often fails due to lack of maintenance support, technical expertise, and manufacturer assistance, leading to equipment downtime and compromised patient care.

Method: Developed AI-powered support platform integrating large language model with web interface for real-time troubleshooting, plus peer-to-peer discussion forum for knowledge exchange; validated using Philips HDI 5000 ultrasound machine.

Result: Achieved 100% precision in error code interpretation and 80% accuracy in suggesting corrective actions in proof-of-concept testing.

Conclusion: AI-driven systems show feasibility and potential to support medical device maintenance in resource-constrained environments, reducing equipment downtime to improve healthcare delivery.

Abstract: In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), a significant proportion of medical diagnostic equipment remains underutilized or non-functional due to a lack of timely maintenance, limited access to technical expertise, and minimal support from manufacturers, particularly for devices acquired through third-party vendors or donations. This challenge contributes to increased equipment downtime, delayed diagnoses, and compromised patient care. This research explores the development and validation of an AI-powered support platform designed to assist biomedical technicians in diagnosing and repairing medical devices in real-time. The system integrates a large language model (LLM) with a user-friendly web interface, enabling imaging technologists/radiographers and biomedical technicians to input error codes or device symptoms and receive accurate, step-by-step troubleshooting guidance. The platform also includes a global peer-to-peer discussion forum to support knowledge exchange and provide additional context for rare or undocumented issues. A proof of concept was developed using the Philips HDI 5000 ultrasound machine, achieving 100% precision in error code interpretation and 80% accuracy in suggesting corrective actions. This study demonstrates the feasibility and potential of AI-driven systems to support medical device maintenance, with the aim of reducing equipment downtime to improve healthcare delivery in resource-constrained environments.
