*Yan Yang,George Bebis,Mircea Nicolescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two-step generative data augmentation framework combining rule-based mask warping with GAN-based image translation to generate realistic masked faces for data-scarce face recognition tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data scarcity and distribution shift challenges in masked face detection and recognition by generating realistic training samples beyond purely synthetic transformations.

Method: Two-step approach: 1) rule-based mask warping, 2) unpaired image-to-image translation using GANs with non-mask preservation loss and stochastic noise injection for training stability and diversity.

Result: Consistent qualitative improvements over rule-based warping alone, complements existing GAN methods like IAMGAN, and demonstrates effectiveness of proposed components.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses data scarcity for masked face tasks and suggests directions for future improvements in data-centric augmentation for face recognition.

Abstract: Data scarcity and distribution shift pose major challenges for masked face detection and recognition. We propose a two-step generative data augmentation framework that combines rule-based mask warping with unpaired image-to-image translation using GANs, enabling the generation of realistic masked-face samples beyond purely synthetic transformations. Compared to rule-based warping alone, the proposed approach yields consistent qualitative improvements and complements existing GAN-based masked face generation methods such as IAMGAN. We introduce a non-mask preservation loss and stochastic noise injection to stabilize training and enhance sample diversity. Experimental observations highlight the effectiveness of the proposed components and suggest directions for future improvements in data-centric augmentation for face recognition tasks.

*Davide Caffagni,Sara Sarto,Marcella Cornia,Lorenzo Baraldi,Pier Luigi Dovesi,Shaghayegh Roohi,Mark Granroth-Wilding,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JARVIS is a JEPA-inspired framework that enhances MLLMs' visual reasoning by integrating self-supervised visual learning through frozen vision foundation models, improving performance on vision-centric tasks without harming multimodal abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs have limited visual reasoning because they learn visual understanding primarily from subjective/incomplete textual descriptions and overfit language priors due to modest multimodal instruction tuning compared to massive text-only pre-training.

Method: Integrates I-JEPA learning paradigm into standard vision-language alignment pipeline, using frozen vision foundation models as context/target encoders, and training predictor (implemented as early LLM layers) to learn structural/semantic regularities from images without exclusive language supervision.

Result: Extensive experiments show JARVIS consistently improves performance on vision-centric benchmarks across different LLM families without degrading multimodal reasoning abilities.

Conclusion: JARVIS effectively addresses MLLMs' visual reasoning limitations through self-supervised visual enhancement, demonstrating the value of integrating JEPA-inspired learning into multimodal training pipelines.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in connecting vision and language, yet their proficiency in fundamental visual reasoning tasks remains limited. This limitation can be attributed to the fact that MLLMs learn visual understanding primarily from textual descriptions, which constitute a subjective and inherently incomplete supervisory signal. Furthermore, the modest scale of multimodal instruction tuning compared to massive text-only pre-training leads MLLMs to overfit language priors while overlooking visual details. To address these issues, we introduce JARVIS, a JEPA-inspired framework for self-supervised visual enhancement in MLLMs. Specifically, we integrate the I-JEPA learning paradigm into the standard vision-language alignment pipeline of MLLMs training. Our approach leverages frozen vision foundation models as context and target encoders, while training the predictor, implemented as the early layers of an LLM, to learn structural and semantic regularities from images without relying exclusively on language supervision. Extensive experiments on standard MLLM benchmarks show that JARVIS consistently improves performance on vision-centric benchmarks across different LLM families, without degrading multimodal reasoning abilities.

### [3] [City Navigation in the Wild: Exploring Emergent Navigation from Web-Scale Knowledge in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15933)
*Dwip Dalal,Utkarsh Mishra,Narendra Ahuja,Nebojsa Jojic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CityNav benchmark tests MLLMs' visual navigation in real cities using only visual inputs, showing current methods fail but proposed Verbalization of Path (VoP) improves performance by creating explicit cognitive maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM evaluation is too language-focused or simulation-based, lacking assessment of knowledge-intensive reasoning needed for real-world embodied tasks like city navigation.

Method: Created CityNav benchmark with 4 global cities requiring agents to navigate 50+ decision points using only visual inputs. Proposed Verbalization of Path (VoP) that extracts explicit cognitive maps (landmarks and directions) from MLLMs to ground reasoning.

Result: State-of-the-art MLLMs and standard reasoning techniques (Chain-of-Thought, Reflection) significantly underperform on CityNav. VoP substantially enhances navigation success by improving spatial reasoning and planning.

Conclusion: Sparsely Grounded Visual Navigation reveals limitations of current MLLMs in real-world embodied reasoning. VoP demonstrates the importance of explicit cognitive mapping for improving MLLM-based navigation in knowledge-intensive environments.

Abstract: Leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to develop embodied agents offers significant promise for addressing complex real-world tasks. However, current evaluation benchmarks remain predominantly language-centric or heavily reliant on simulated environments, rarely probing the nuanced, knowledge-intensive reasoning essential for practical, real-world scenarios. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce the task of Sparsely Grounded Visual Navigation, explicitly designed to evaluate the sequential decision-making abilities of MLLMs in challenging, knowledge-intensive real-world environments. We operationalize this task with CityNav, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing four diverse global cities, specifically constructed to assess raw MLLM-driven agents in city navigation. Agents are required to rely solely on visual inputs and internal multimodal reasoning to sequentially navigate 50+ decision points without additional environmental annotations or specialized architectural modifications. Crucially, agents must autonomously achieve localization through interpreting city-specific cues and recognizing landmarks, perform spatial reasoning, and strategically plan and execute routes to their destinations. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that current state-of-the-art MLLMs and standard reasoning techniques (e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Reflection) significantly underperform in this challenging setting. To address this, we propose Verbalization of Path (VoP), which explicitly grounds the agent's internal reasoning by probing an explicit cognitive map (key landmarks and directions toward the destination) from the MLLMs, substantially enhancing navigation success.

### [4] [R4: Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning for Vision-Language Models in 4D Spatio-Temporal Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15940)
*Tin Stribor Sohn,Maximilian Dillitzer,Jason J. Corso,Eric Sax*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R4 is a training-free framework that gives vision-language models structured 4D memory for spatio-temporal reasoning by anchoring object semantics in metric space and time, enabling retrieval-based reasoning without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans build persistent, structured 4D representations (semantic meaning + spatial layout + temporal dynamics) for reasoning about their surroundings. Current VLMs lack this capability for embodied reasoning in dynamic environments.

Method: R4 continuously constructs a 4D knowledge database by anchoring object-level semantic descriptions in metric space and time. At inference, natural language queries are decomposed into semantic, spatial, and temporal keys to retrieve relevant observations for VLM reasoning.

Result: Experiments on embodied question answering and navigation benchmarks show R4 substantially improves retrieval and reasoning over spatio-temporal information compared to baselines.

Conclusion: R4 advances a new paradigm for embodied 4D reasoning in dynamic environments through training-free, structured memory that enables episodic and collaborative reasoning across agents.

Abstract: Humans perceive and reason about their surroundings in four dimensions by building persistent, structured internal representations that encode semantic meaning, spatial layout, and temporal dynamics. These multimodal memories enable them to recall past events, infer unobserved states, and integrate new information into context-dependent reasoning. Inspired by this capability, we introduce R4, a training-free framework for retrieval-augmented reasoning in 4D spatio-temporal space that equips vision-language models (VLMs) with structured, lifelong memory. R4 continuously constructs a 4D knowledge database by anchoring object-level semantic descriptions in metric space and time, yielding a persistent world model that can be shared across agents. At inference, natural language queries are decomposed into semantic, spatial, and temporal keys to retrieve relevant observations, which are integrated into the VLM's reasoning. Unlike classical retrieval-augmented generation methods, retrieval in R4 operates directly in 4D space, enabling episodic and collaborative reasoning without training. Experiments on embodied question answering and navigation benchmarks demonstrate that R4 substantially improves retrieval and reasoning over spatio-temporal information compared to baselines, advancing a new paradigm for embodied 4D reasoning in dynamic environments.

### [5] [The Perceptual Observatory Characterizing Robustness and Grounding in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15949)
*Tejas Anvekar,Fenil Bardoliya,Pavan K. Turaga,Chitta Baral,Vivek Gupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The Perceptual Observatory is a framework that systematically evaluates multimodal LLMs' visual perceptual capabilities beyond just accuracy, testing robustness, attribution fidelity, and reasoning under controlled perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM evaluations focus too much on end-task accuracy while overlooking whether progress reflects genuine visual grounding or just reliance on textual knowledge. Most models scale language components while reusing identical vision encoders, raising concerns about true perceptual capabilities.

Method: A framework with two main verticals: (1) simple vision tasks like face matching and text-in-vision comprehension, and (2) local-to-global understanding including image matching, grid pointing game, and attribute localization. Uses ground-truth datasets systematically perturbed through pixel-based augmentations and diffusion-based stylized illusions.

Result: The framework moves beyond leaderboard accuracy to provide insights into how MLLMs preserve perceptual grounding and relational structure under perturbations, offering a principled foundation for analyzing model strengths and weaknesses.

Conclusion: The Perceptual Observatory provides a systematic way to characterize MLLMs' perceptual capacities, addressing the gap in current evaluation methods and enabling better understanding of whether model improvements reflect genuine visual understanding versus textual knowledge exploitation.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have yielded increasingly powerful models, yet their perceptual capacities remain poorly characterized. In practice, most model families scale language component while reusing nearly identical vision encoders (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL 3B/7B/72B), which raises pivotal concerns about whether progress reflects genuine visual grounding or reliance on internet-scale textual world knowledge. Existing evaluation methods emphasize end-task accuracy, overlooking robustness, attribution fidelity, and reasoning under controlled perturbations. We present The Perceptual Observatory, a framework that characterizes MLLMs across verticals like: (i) simple vision tasks, such as face matching and text-in-vision comprehension capabilities; (ii) local-to-global understanding, encompassing image matching, grid pointing game, and attribute localization, which tests general visual grounding. Each vertical is instantiated with ground-truth datasets of faces and words, systematically perturbed through pixel-based augmentations and diffusion-based stylized illusions. The Perceptual Observatory moves beyond leaderboard accuracy to yield insights into how MLLMs preserve perceptual grounding and relational structure under perturbations, providing a principled foundation for analyzing strengths and weaknesses of current and future models.

### [6] [Seeing is Believing (and Predicting): Context-Aware Multi-Human Behavior Prediction with Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15957)
*Utsav Panchal,Yuchen Liu,Luigi Palmieri,Ilche Georgievski,Marco Aiello*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAMP-VLM is a Vision Language Model framework that predicts multi-human behaviors from third-person perspective using visual context and spatial scene graphs, achieving 66.9% accuracy improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research focuses on single-human behavior prediction from egocentric view, but many robotic applications require understanding multiple human behaviors from third-person perspective in human-populated environments.

Method: Uses Vision Language Model (VLM) framework incorporating contextual visual features and spatial awareness from scene graphs. Fine-tuned with synthetic human behavior data from photorealistic simulator using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

Result: CAMP-VLM outperforms best-performing baseline by up to 66.9% in prediction accuracy, evaluated on both synthetic and real-world sequences to assess generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the gap in multi-human behavior prediction from observer view and demonstrates strong generalization from synthetic to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Accurately predicting human behaviors is crucial for mobile robots operating in human-populated environments. While prior research primarily focuses on predicting actions in single-human scenarios from an egocentric view, several robotic applications require understanding multiple human behaviors from a third-person perspective. To this end, we present CAMP-VLM (Context-Aware Multi-human behavior Prediction): a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based framework that incorporates contextual features from visual input and spatial awareness from scene graphs to enhance prediction of humans-scene interactions. Due to the lack of suitable datasets for multi-human behavior prediction from an observer view, we perform fine-tuning of CAMP-VLM with synthetic human behavior data generated by a photorealistic simulator, and evaluate the resulting models on both synthetic and real-world sequences to assess their generalization capabilities. Leveraging Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), CAMP-VLM outperforms the best-performing baseline by up to 66.9% in prediction accuracy.

### [7] [From Words to Wavelengths: VLMs for Few-Shot Multispectral Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15971)
*Manuel Nkegoum,Minh-Tan Pham,Élisa Fromont,Bruno Avignon,Sébastien Lefèvre*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLM-based detectors adapted for multispectral inputs outperform specialized models in few-shot regimes and achieve competitive results in fully supervised settings, leveraging semantic priors from large-scale vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited annotated multispectral data restricts deep detector training; textual class information can provide valuable semantic supervision in data-scarce scenarios, especially for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving and surveillance.

Method: Adapt two VLM-based detectors (Grounding DINO and YOLO-World) to handle multispectral inputs and propose effective mechanism to integrate text, visual, and thermal modalities.

Result: VLM-based detectors excel in few-shot regimes, significantly outperforming specialized multispectral models with comparable data, and achieve competitive/superior results in fully supervised settings on FLIR and M3FD benchmarks.

Conclusion: Semantic priors from large-scale VLMs effectively transfer to unseen spectral modalities, offering powerful pathway for data-efficient multispectral perception.

Abstract: Multispectral object detection is critical for safety-sensitive applications such as autonomous driving and surveillance, where robust perception under diverse illumination conditions is essential. However, the limited availability of annotated multispectral data severely restricts the training of deep detectors. In such data-scarce scenarios, textual class information can serve as a valuable source of semantic supervision. Motivated by the recent success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in computer vision, we explore their potential for few-shot multispectral object detection. Specifically, we adapt two representative VLM-based detectors, Grounding DINO and YOLO-World, to handle multispectral inputs and propose an effective mechanism to integrate text, visual and thermal modalities. Through extensive experiments on two popular multispectral image benchmarks, FLIR and M3FD, we demonstrate that VLM-based detectors not only excel in few-shot regimes, significantly outperforming specialized multispectral models trained with comparable data, but also achieve competitive or superior results under fully supervised settings. Our findings reveal that the semantic priors learned by large-scale VLMs effectively transfer to unseen spectral modalities, ofFering a powerful pathway toward data-efficient multispectral perception.

### [8] [Are vision-language models ready to zero-shot replace supervised classification models in agriculture?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15977)
*Earl Ranario,Mason J. Earles*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs underperform supervised models on agricultural classification tasks, with best VLM reaching ~62% accuracy vs. much higher supervised baseline performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the reliability of vision-language models for agricultural decision support by benchmarking them against supervised baselines on diverse agricultural classification tasks.

Method: Benchmarked diverse open-source and closed-source VLMs on 27 agricultural classification datasets from AgML collection (162 classes), comparing zero-shot performance against supervised YOLO11 baseline using multiple-choice and open-ended prompting with LLM-based semantic judging.

Result: VLMs substantially underperform supervised baseline; best VLM (Gemini-3 Pro) reaches ~62% accuracy with multiple-choice prompting; open-ended prompting yields much lower performance (<25%); semantic judging improves open-ended accuracy; plant/weed classification easier than pest/damage identification.

Conclusion: Current off-the-shelf VLMs are not suitable as standalone agricultural diagnostic systems but can function as assistive components when paired with constrained interfaces, explicit label ontologies, and domain-aware evaluation strategies.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly proposed as general-purpose solutions for visual recognition tasks, yet their reliability for agricultural decision support remains poorly understood. We benchmark a diverse set of open-source and closed-source VLMs on 27 agricultural classification datasets from the AgML collection, spanning 162 classes across plant disease, pest and damage, and plant and weed species identification. Across all tasks, zero-shot VLMs substantially underperform a supervised task-specific baseline (YOLO11), which consistently achieves markedly higher accuracy than any foundation model. Under multiple-choice prompting, the best-performing VLM (Gemini-3 Pro) reaches approximately 62% average accuracy, while open-ended prompting yields much lower performance, with raw accuracies typically below 25%. Applying LLM-based semantic judging increases open-ended accuracy (for example, from 21% to 30% for top models) and alters model rankings, demonstrating that evaluation methodology meaningfully affects reported conclusions. Among open-source models, Qwen-VL-72B performs best, approaching closed-source performance under constrained prompting but still trailing top proprietary systems. Task-level analysis shows that plant and weed species classification is consistently easier than pest and damage identification, which remains the most challenging category across models. Overall, these results indicate that current off-the-shelf VLMs are not yet suitable as standalone agricultural diagnostic systems, but can function as assistive components when paired with constrained interfaces, explicit label ontologies, and domain-aware evaluation strategies.

### [9] [Eyes on the Grass: Biodiversity-Increasing Robotic Mowing Using Deep Visual Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15993)
*Lars Beckers,Arno Waes,Aaron Van Campenhout,Toon Goedemé*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Robotic mowing system uses deep learning to preserve visually diverse vegetation patches, enhancing garden biodiversity without species-level supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To transform ecologically worthless monocultural lawns into vibrant biotopes that boost urban biodiversity through active robotic intervention rather than passive rewilding.

Method: Uses ResNet50 pretrained on PlantNet300K for deep feature-space analysis to identify diverse vegetation patches, calculates global deviation metric for biodiversity estimation, and implements selective mowing algorithm that dynamically alternates between mowing and conservation based on visual diversity.

Result: Strong correlation between embedding-space dispersion and expert biodiversity assessment, confirming feasibility of deep visual diversity as proxy for ecological richness and effectiveness of the selective mowing approach.

Conclusion: The system successfully demonstrates that robotic mowers can actively enhance garden biodiversity, potentially transforming monocultural lawns into valuable urban biotopes through widespread adoption.

Abstract: This paper presents a robotic mowing framework that actively enhances garden biodiversity through visual perception and adaptive decision-making. Unlike passive rewilding approaches, the proposed system uses deep feature-space analysis to identify and preserve visually diverse vegetation patches in camera images by selectively deactivating the mower blades. A ResNet50 network pretrained on PlantNet300K provides ecologically meaningful embeddings, from which a global deviation metric estimates biodiversity without species-level supervision. These estimates drive a selective mowing algorithm that dynamically alternates between mowing and conservation behavior. The system was implemented on a modified commercial robotic mower and validated both in a controlled mock-up lawn and on real garden datasets. Results demonstrate a strong correlation between embedding-space dispersion and expert biodiversity assessment, confirming the feasibility of deep visual diversity as a proxy for ecological richness and the effectiveness of the proposed mowing decision approach. Widespread adoption of such systems will turn ecologically worthless, monocultural lawns into vibrant, valuable biotopes that boost urban biodiversity.

### [10] [CoVAR: Co-generation of Video and Action for Robotic Manipulation via Multi-Modal Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16023)
*Liudi Yang,Yang Bai,George Eskandar,Fengyi Shen,Mohammad Altillawi,Dong Chen,Ziyuan Liu,Abhinav Valada*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method that generates video-action pairs from text instructions using parallel diffusion models with cross-modal attention, enabling robotic policy learning without action annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for robotic policy learning either use two-stage pipelines that limit cross-modal information sharing, or adapt single-modal diffusion models that cannot fully leverage pretrained video knowledge. There's also a common lack of action annotations in video datasets, preventing full use of video diffusion models for robotic learning.

Method: Three key components: (1) Extend a pretrained video diffusion model with a parallel, dedicated action diffusion model to preserve pretrained knowledge, (2) Introduce Bridge Attention mechanism for effective cross-modal interaction between video and action modalities, (3) Design an action refinement module to convert coarse actions into precise controls for low-resolution datasets.

Result: Extensive evaluations on multiple public benchmarks and real-world datasets demonstrate that the method generates higher-quality videos, more accurate actions, and significantly outperforms existing baselines.

Conclusion: The approach offers a scalable framework for leveraging large-scale video data for robotic learning by automatically providing action labels for video diffusion models, overcoming the lack of action annotations and enabling full use of pretrained video knowledge.

Abstract: We present a method to generate video-action pairs that follow text instructions, starting from an initial image observation and the robot's joint states. Our approach automatically provides action labels for video diffusion models, overcoming the common lack of action annotations and enabling their full use for robotic policy learning. Existing methods either adopt two-stage pipelines, which limit tightly coupled cross-modal information sharing, or rely on adapting a single-modal diffusion model for a joint distribution that cannot fully leverage pretrained video knowledge. To overcome these limitations, we (1) extend a pretrained video diffusion model with a parallel, dedicated action diffusion model that preserves pretrained knowledge, (2) introduce a Bridge Attention mechanism to enable effective cross-modal interaction, and (3) design an action refinement module to convert coarse actions into precise controls for low-resolution datasets. Extensive evaluations on multiple public benchmarks and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method generates higher-quality videos, more accurate actions, and significantly outperforms existing baselines, offering a scalable framework for leveraging large-scale video data for robotic learning.

### [11] [Driving in Corner Case: A Real-World Adversarial Closed-Loop Evaluation Platform for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16055)
*Jiaheng Geng,Jiatong Du,Xinyu Zhang,Ye Li,Panqu Wang,Yanjun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a closed-loop evaluation platform for end-to-end autonomous driving that generates adversarial interactions in real-world scenes to create safety-critical corner cases for testing model robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety-critical corner cases are crucial for evaluating autonomous driving systems but are difficult to collect in the real world. Existing adversarial evaluation methods work in simplified simulations but not for real-world end-to-end autonomous driving.

Method: A closed-loop platform with two components: 1) A real-world image generator based on flow matching that efficiently produces realistic driving images from traffic environment information, and 2) An adversarial traffic policy that models challenging interactions to create corner cases. The platform evaluates end-to-end models like UniAD and VAD.

Result: The platform generates realistic driving images efficiently and successfully creates corner cases that cause performance degradation in tested end-to-end models (UniAD and VAD), demonstrating its ability to detect model vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed platform effectively evaluates end-to-end autonomous driving models by generating adversarial interactions in real-world scenes, helping identify potential safety issues and improve system robustness.

Abstract: Safety-critical corner cases, difficult to collect in the real world, are crucial for evaluating end-to-end autonomous driving. Adversarial interaction is an effective method to generate such safety-critical corner cases. While existing adversarial evaluation methods are built for models operating in simplified simulation environments, adversarial evaluation for real-world end-to-end autonomous driving has been little explored. To address this challenge, we propose a closed-loop evaluation platform for end-to-end autonomous driving, which can generate adversarial interactions in real-world scenes. In our platform, the real-world image generator cooperates with an adversarial traffic policy to evaluate various end-to-end models trained on real-world data. The generator, based on flow matching, efficiently and stably generates real-world images according to the traffic environment information. The efficient adversarial surrounding vehicle policy is designed to model challenging interactions and create corner cases that current autonomous driving systems struggle to handle. Experimental results demonstrate that the platform can generate realistic driving images efficiently. Through evaluating the end-to-end models such as UniAD and VAD, we demonstrate that based on the adversarial policy, our platform evaluates the performance degradation of the tested model in corner cases. This result indicates that this platform can effectively detect the model's potential issues, which will facilitate the safety and robustness of end-to-end autonomous driving.

*Hao Tang,Hanyu Liu,Alessandro Perelli,Xi Chen,Chao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 3D multi-channel patch diffusion model that predicts high angular resolution FOD from low angular resolution dMRI using patch-based learning with brain anatomy priors, SH attention, and conditional coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-shell low angular resolution dMRI (LAR-FOD) has limited accuracy, while multi-shell high angular resolution dMRI (HAR-FOD) requires long scanning times that limit clinical applicability. Diffusion models show promise but face challenges with the large number of spherical harmonic coefficients in FOD.

Method: Proposes a 3D multi-channel patch diffusion model with: 1) FOD-patch adapter incorporating brain anatomy priors for efficient patch-based learning, 2) voxel-level conditional coordinating module for global understanding, and 3) SH attention module to learn complex correlations between spherical harmonic coefficients.

Result: The method achieves the best performance in HAR-FOD prediction and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed diffusion model effectively addresses the challenge of generating high-quality HAR-FOD from LAR-FOD by incorporating anatomical priors, global coordination, and specialized attention mechanisms for spherical harmonic coefficients.

Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a critical non-invasive technique to estimate fiber orientation distribution (FOD) for characterizing white matter integrity. Estimating FOD from single-shell low angular resolution dMRI (LAR-FOD) is limited by accuracy, whereas estimating FOD from multi-shell high angular resolution dMRI (HAR-FOD) requires a long scanning time, which limits its applicability. Diffusion models have shown promise in estimating HAR-FOD based on LAR-FOD. However, using diffusion models to efficiently generate HAR-FOD is challenging due to the large number of spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients in FOD. Here, we propose a 3D multi-channel patch diffusion model to predict HAR-FOD from LAR-FOD. We design the FOD-patch adapter by introducing the prior brain anatomy for more efficient patch-based learning. Furthermore, we introduce a voxel-level conditional coordinating module to enhance the global understanding of the model. We design the SH attention module to effectively learn the complex correlations of the SH coefficients. Our experimental results show that our method achieves the best performance in HAR-FOD prediction and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: AV3DOD is a novel framework for auto-vocabulary 3D object detection that automatically generates class names without user input, achieving SOTA performance on localization and semantic quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-vocabulary 3D object detection methods still require user-specified classes during training and inference. The authors propose to study Auto-Vocabulary 3D Object Detection (AV3DOD) where classes are automatically generated without any user input.

Method: Introduces Semantic Score (SS) to evaluate generated class names. Develops AV3DOD framework that leverages 2D vision-language models through image captioning, pseudo 3D box generation, and feature-space semantics expansion.

Conclusion: AV3DOD successfully demonstrates auto-vocabulary 3D object detection with automatically generated class names, outperforming existing methods in both localization accuracy and semantic quality.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D object detection methods are able to localize 3D boxes of classes unseen during training. Despite the name, existing methods rely on user-specified classes both at training and inference. We propose to study Auto-Vocabulary 3D Object Detection (AV3DOD), where the classes are automatically generated for the detected objects without any user input. To this end, we introduce Semantic Score (SS) to evaluate the quality of the generated class names. We then develop a novel framework, AV3DOD, which leverages 2D vision-language models (VLMs) to generate rich semantic candidates through image captioning, pseudo 3D box generation, and feature-space semantics expansion. AV3DOD achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both localization (mAP) and semantic quality (SS) on the ScanNetV2 and SUNRGB-D datasets. Notably, it surpasses the SOTA, CoDA, by 3.48 overall mAP and attains a 24.5% relative improvement in SS on ScanNetV2.

TL;DR: LAPX is a lightweight human pose estimation network with self-attention that achieves competitive accuracy with only 2.3M parameters while maintaining real-time edge-device performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SOTA pose estimation models are too computationally expensive for edge deployment, while lightweight variants either have inefficient components for edge devices or suffer from accuracy degradation due to oversimplified designs.

Method: Proposes LAPX, an Hourglass network with self-attention that captures global contextual information, building on previous LAP work. It advances stage design and refines lightweight attention modules for efficiency.

Result: Achieves competitive results on MPII and COCO benchmark datasets with only 2.3M parameters, demonstrating real-time performance suitable for edge devices.

Conclusion: LAPX successfully balances accuracy and efficiency for human pose estimation, providing a solution suitable for edge deployment with minimal parameter count while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Human pose estimation is a crucial task in computer vision. Methods that have SOTA (State-of-the-Art) accuracy, often involve a large number of parameters and incur substantial computational cost. Many lightweight variants have been proposed to reduce the model size and computational cost of them. However, several of these methods still contain components that are not well suited for efficient deployment on edge devices. Moreover, models that primarily emphasize inference speed on edge devices often suffer from limited accuracy due to their overly simplified designs. To address these limitations, we propose LAPX, an Hourglass network with self-attention that captures global contextual information, based on previous work, LAP. In addition to adopting the self-attention module, LAPX advances the stage design and refine the lightweight attention modules. It achieves competitive results on two benchmark datasets, MPII and COCO, with only 2.3M parameters, and demonstrates real-time performance, confirming its edge-device suitability.

Abstract: Event cameras are a new type of brain-inspired visual sensor with advantages such as high dynamic range and high temporal resolution. The geometric calibration of event cameras, which involves determining their intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, particularly in long-range measurement scenarios, remains a significant challenge. To address the dual requirements of long-distance and high-precision measurement, we propose an event camera calibration method utilizing a collimator with flickering star-based patterns. The proposed method first linearly solves camera parameters using the sphere motion model of the collimator, followed by nonlinear optimization to refine these parameters with high precision. Through comprehensive real-world experiments across varying conditions, we demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing event camera calibration methods in terms of accuracy and reliability.

In addition, TurboDiffusion incorporates several other engineering optimizations.
  We conduct experiments on the Wan2.2-I2V-14B-720P, Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B-480P, Wan2.1-T2V-14B-720P, and Wan2.1-T2V-14B-480P models.

TL;DR: Novel camera calibration method using collimator system with angle invariance constraint reduces 6DOF motion to 3DOF pure rotation, enabling linear solvers and single-image calibration without camera motion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camera calibration is crucial for photogrammetry and 3D vision, but existing methods may lack reliability, controllability, or flexibility. The paper aims to provide a more reliable and flexible calibration solution using a designed collimator system.

Method: Uses a designed collimator system to create a controllable calibration environment. Introduces an angle invariance constraint based on the collimator's optical geometry, proving that relative motion follows a spherical motion model (reducing 6DOF to 3DOF pure rotation). Develops closed-form linear solvers for multiple images, minimal solver for two images, and a single collimator image calibration algorithm that eliminates camera motion requirements.

Result: Evaluated in synthetic and real-world experiments, verifying feasibility of collimator-based calibration and demonstrating superiority over existing baseline methods.

Conclusion: The collimator system provides a reliable calibration environment, and the proposed method with angle invariance constraint enables flexible, fast calibration with reduced motion complexity, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Camera calibration is a crucial step in photogrammetry and 3D vision applications. This paper introduces a novel camera calibration method using a designed collimator system. Our collimator system provides a reliable and controllable calibration environment for the camera. Exploiting the unique optical geometry property of our collimator system, we introduce an angle invariance constraint and further prove that the relative motion between the calibration target and camera conforms to a spherical motion model. This constraint reduces the original 6DOF relative motion between target and camera to a 3DOF pure rotation motion. Using spherical motion constraint, a closed-form linear solver for multiple images and a minimal solver for two images are proposed for camera calibration. Furthermore, we propose a single collimator image calibration algorithm based on the angle invariance constraint. This algorithm eliminates the requirement for camera motion, providing a novel solution for flexible and fast calibration. The performance of our method is evaluated in both synthetic and real-world experiments, which verify the feasibility of calibration using the collimator system and demonstrate that our method is superior to existing baseline methods.

TL;DR: CattleAct: A data-efficient method for detecting behavioral interactions between grazing cattle from single images by decomposing interactions into individual actions and using contrastive learning to embed rare interactions in a unified latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smart livestock management needs automated detection of cattle interactions (e.g., for estrus detection), but existing methods face challenges due to the rarity of such interactions and lack of comprehensive behavioral datasets with interactions.

Method: First learns an action latent space from large-scale cattle action dataset, then fine-tunes using contrastive learning to embed rare interactions, creating a unified latent space for both actions and interactions. Also develops a practical system integrating video and GPS inputs.

Result: Experiments on commercial-scale pasture demonstrate accurate interaction detection compared to baselines.

Conclusion: CattleAct provides an effective, data-efficient solution for detecting rare cattle interactions, enabling practical smart livestock management applications with available implementation.

Abstract: This paper introduces a method and application for automatically detecting behavioral interactions between grazing cattle from a single image, which is essential for smart livestock management in the cattle industry, such as for detecting estrus. Although interaction detection for humans has been actively studied, a non-trivial challenge lies in cattle interaction detection, specifically the lack of a comprehensive behavioral dataset that includes interactions, as the interactions of grazing cattle are rare events. We, therefore, propose CattleAct, a data-efficient method for interaction detection by decomposing interactions into the combinations of actions by individual cattle. Specifically, we first learn an action latent space from a large-scale cattle action dataset. Then, we embed rare interactions via the fine-tuning of the pre-trained latent space using contrastive learning, thereby constructing a unified latent space of actions and interactions. On top of the proposed method, we develop a practical working system integrating video and GPS inputs. Experiments on a commercial-scale pasture demonstrate the accurate interaction detection achieved by our method compared to the baselines. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/rakawanegan/CattleAct.

TL;DR: Hybrid DSCT reconstruction framework combining iterative OPMT for fast intermediate decomposition and ResDynUNet++ neural network for refinement, achieving superior performance on synthetic and clinical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an effective dual-spectral CT reconstruction method that addresses challenges like channel imbalance and near-interface artifacts, combining the strengths of knowledge-driven and data-driven approaches.

Method: Two-stage hybrid framework: 1) Knowledge-driven phase using OPMT for fast intermediate basis material decomposition, 2) Data-driven phase using novel ResDynUNet++ network (UNet++ backbone with residual dynamic convolution blocks) for refinement.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic phantoms and real clinical datasets validate the method's efficacy and superior performance in producing clean, accurate DSCT reconstructions.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid framework successfully integrates iterative and deep learning approaches for DSCT reconstruction, effectively addressing key challenges and demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: We propose a hybrid reconstruction framework for dual-spectral CT (DSCT) that integrates iterative methods with deep learning models. The reconstruction process consists of two complementary components: a knowledge-driven module and a data-driven module. In the knowledge-driven phase, we employ the oblique projection modification technique (OPMT) to reconstruct an intermediate solution of the basis material images from the projection data. We select OPMT for this role because of its fast convergence, which allows it to rapidly generate an intermediate solution that successfully achieves basis material decomposition. Subsequently, in the data-driven phase, we introduce a novel neural network, ResDynUNet++, to refine this intermediate solution. The ResDynUNet++ is built upon a UNet++ backbone by replacing standard convolutions with residual dynamic convolution blocks, which combine the adaptive, input-specific feature extraction of dynamic convolution with the stable training of residual connections. This architecture is designed to address challenges like channel imbalance and near-interface large artifacts in DSCT, producing clean and accurate final solutions. Extensive experiments on both synthetic phantoms and real clinical datasets validate the efficacy and superior performance of the proposed method.

*Yueyang Hu,Haiyong Jiang,Haoxuan Song,Jun Xiao,Hao Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegGraph: A novel SAM segment graph-based propagation method for few-shot 3D part segmentation that aggregates 2D foundation model knowledge to 3D by learning geometric features from SAM segmentation masks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for few-shot 3D part segmentation either ignore geometric structures for 3D feature learning or neglect high-quality grouping clues from SAM, leading to under-segmentation and inconsistent part labels. There's a need to effectively aggregate 2D knowledge from foundation models to 3D.

Method: SegGraph constructs a segment graph where nodes represent SAM segments and edges capture spatial relationships (overlap/adjacency). Each node adaptively modulates 2D foundation model features, which are then propagated via a graph neural network to learn global geometric structures. A novel view-direction-weighted fusion maps segment features to 3D points while attenuating contributions from low-quality segments.

Result: Extensive experiments on PartNet-E show SegGraph outperforms all competing baselines by at least 6.9% mIoU. The method achieves particularly strong performance on small components and part boundaries, demonstrating superior geometric understanding.

Conclusion: SegGraph effectively addresses the challenge of aggregating 2D foundation model knowledge to 3D for few-shot part segmentation by explicitly learning geometric features from SAM segmentation masks through a novel graph-based propagation approach with view-direction-weighted fusion.

Abstract: This work presents a novel framework for few-shot 3D part segmentation. Recent advances have demonstrated the significant potential of 2D foundation models for low-shot 3D part segmentation. However, it is still an open problem that how to effectively aggregate 2D knowledge from foundation models to 3D. Existing methods either ignore geometric structures for 3D feature learning or neglects the high-quality grouping clues from SAM, leading to under-segmentation and inconsistent part labels. We devise a novel SAM segment graph-based propagation method, named SegGraph, to explicitly learn geometric features encoded within SAM's segmentation masks. Our method encodes geometric features by modeling mutual overlap and adjacency between segments while preserving intra-segment semantic consistency. We construct a segment graph, conceptually similar to an atlas, where nodes represent segments and edges capture their spatial relationships (overlap/adjacency). Each node adaptively modulates 2D foundation model features, which are then propagated via a graph neural network to learn global geometric structures. To enforce intra-segment semantic consistency, we map segment features to 3D points with a novel view-direction-weighted fusion attenuating contributions from low-quality segments. Extensive experiments on PartNet-E demonstrate that our method outperforms all competing baselines by at least 6.9 percent mIoU. Further analysis reveals that SegGraph achieves particularly strong performance on small components and part boundaries, demonstrating its superior geometric understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt-tuning strategies for Vision-Language Models in UDA primarily align marginal distribution but neglect conditional distribution discrepancies, leading to class prototype misalignment and degraded semantic discriminability.

Method: Proposes C-DGPA: Class-Centric Dual Alignment Generative Prompt Adaptation with a dual-branch architecture. One branch uses dynamic adversarial training for marginal distribution alignment, while the other introduces a Class Mapping Mechanism (CMM) for conditional distribution alignment by standardizing semantic prompt understanding and preventing source domain over-reliance.

Result: Extensive experiments on OfficeHome, Office31, and VisDA-2017 validate superiority, achieving new state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks.

Conclusion: C-DGPA effectively integrates domain knowledge into prompt learning via synergistic optimization, ensuring domain-invariant and semantically discriminative representations for unsupervised domain adaptation.

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation transfers knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Directly deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with prompt tuning in downstream UDA tasks faces the signifi cant challenge of mitigating domain discrepancies. Existing prompt-tuning strategies primarily align marginal distribu tion, but neglect conditional distribution discrepancies, lead ing to critical issues such as class prototype misalignment and degraded semantic discriminability. To address these lim itations, the work proposes C-DGPA: Class-Centric Dual Alignment Generative Prompt Adaptation. C-DGPA syner gistically optimizes marginal distribution alignment and con ditional distribution alignment through a novel dual-branch architecture. The marginal distribution alignment branch em ploys a dynamic adversarial training framework to bridge marginal distribution discrepancies. Simultaneously, the con ditional distribution alignment branch introduces a Class Mapping Mechanism (CMM) to align conditional distribu tion discrepancies by standardizing semantic prompt under standing and preventing source domain over-reliance. This dual alignment strategy effectively integrates domain knowl edge into prompt learning via synergistic optimization, ensur ing domain-invariant and semantically discriminative repre sentations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cameras for end-to-end driving suffer from domain gap issues when deployment conditions differ from training data, particularly with day-night lighting differences.

Method: Propose using event cameras instead of traditional cameras to handle lighting condition domain gaps without requiring additional adjustments or adaptations.

Result: Event cameras maintain more consistent performance across lighting conditions, show comparable or smaller domain-shift penalties than grayscale frames, and provide superior baseline performance in cross-domain scenarios.

Conclusion: Event cameras are a promising alternative to traditional cameras for autonomous driving systems, offering better resilience to lighting condition domain gaps without needing additional adjustments.

Abstract: Although traditional cameras are the primary sensor for end-to-end driving, their performance suffers greatly when the conditions of the data they were trained on does not match the deployment environment, a problem known as the domain gap. In this work, we consider the day-night lighting difference domain gap. Instead of traditional cameras we propose event cameras as a potential alternative which can maintain performance across lighting condition domain gaps without requiring additional adjustments. Our results show that event cameras maintain more consistent performance across lighting conditions, exhibiting domain-shift penalties that are generally comparable to or smaller than grayscale frames and provide superior baseline performance in cross-domain scenarios.

Abstract: We present Avatar4D, a real-world transferable pipeline for generating customizable synthetic human motion datasets tailored to domain-specific applications. Unlike prior works, which focus on general, everyday motions and offer limited flexibility, our approach provides fine-grained control over body pose, appearance, camera viewpoint, and environmental context, without requiring any manual annotations. To validate the impact of Avatar4D, we focus on sports, where domain-specific human actions and movement patterns pose unique challenges for motion understanding. In this setting, we introduce Syn2Sport, a large-scale synthetic dataset spanning sports, including baseball and ice hockey. Avatar4D features high-fidelity 4D (3D geometry over time) human motion sequences with varying player appearances rendered in diverse environments. We benchmark several state-of-the-art pose estimation models on Syn2Sport and demonstrate their effectiveness for supervised learning, zero-shot transfer to real-world data, and generalization across sports.

TL;DR: VALOR introduces a reinforcement learning framework with GRPO to improve visual grounding and clinical accuracy in radiology report generation by aligning vision-language representations and focusing on disease-relevant image regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Med-VLMs struggle with generating visually grounded and clinically accurate radiology reports, often suffering from hallucinations due to poor cross-modal alignment between visual and linguistic representations. Existing approaches rely on large labeled corpora, costly preference data, or retrieval methods that don't adequately address these alignment issues.

Method: VALOR uses a two-stage reinforcement learning-based post-alignment framework with Group-Relative Proximal Optimization (GRPO). Stage 1 improves the Med-VLM with textual rewards for clinically precise terminology. Stage 2 aligns the vision projection module with disease findings to guide attention toward diagnostically relevant image regions.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show VALOR substantially improves factual accuracy and visual grounding, achieving significant performance gains over state-of-the-art radiology report generation methods.

Conclusion: VALOR effectively addresses the challenge of generating both visually grounded and clinically accurate radiology reports by improving cross-modal alignment through reinforcement learning, offering a promising approach for automating healthcare workflows while reducing medical professionals' workload.

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) is a critical step toward automating healthcare workflows, facilitating accurate patient assessments, and reducing the workload of medical professionals. Despite recent progress in Large Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs), generating radiology reports that are both visually grounded and clinically accurate remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches often rely on large labeled corpora for pre-training, costly task-specific preference data, or retrieval-based methods. However, these strategies do not adequately mitigate hallucinations arising from poor cross-modal alignment between visual and linguistic representations. To address these limitations, we propose VALOR:Visual Alignment of Medical Vision-Language Models for GrOunded Radiology Report Generation. Our method introduces a reinforcement learning-based post-alignment framework utilizing Group-Relative Proximal Optimization (GRPO). The training proceeds in two stages: (1) improving the Med-VLM with textual rewards to encourage clinically precise terminology, and (2) aligning the vision projection module of the textually grounded model with disease findings, thereby guiding attention toward image re gions most relevant to the diagnostic task. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VALOR substantially improves factual accuracy and visual grounding, achieving significant performance gains over state-of-the-art report generation methods.

Motivation: AI agents need adaptive visual scene categorization for changing tasks, unlike fixed common categories. Ad-hoc categories are created dynamically for specific goals, requiring discovery of underlying context from few labeled exemplars and abundant unlabeled data.

Method: OAK introduces a small set of learnable context tokens at the input of a frozen CLIP model, optimized with both CLIP's image-text alignment objective and GCD's visual clustering objective for semantic extension and visual clustering.

Conclusion: OAK enables adaptive and generalizable categorization with interpretable saliency maps that promote transparency and trust, demonstrating effectiveness for open ad-hoc categorization tasks.

Abstract: Adaptive categorization of visual scenes is essential for AI agents to handle changing tasks. Unlike fixed common categories for plants or animals, ad-hoc categories are created dynamically to serve specific goals. We study open ad-hoc categorization: Given a few labeled exemplars and abundant unlabeled data, the goal is to discover the underlying context and to expand ad-hoc categories through semantic extension and visual clustering around it.
  Building on the insight that ad-hoc and common categories rely on similar perceptual mechanisms, we propose OAK, a simple model that introduces a small set of learnable context tokens at the input of a frozen CLIP and optimizes with both CLIP's image-text alignment objective and GCD's visual clustering objective.
  On Stanford and Clevr-4 datasets, OAK achieves state-of-the-art in accuracy and concept discovery across multiple categorizations, including 87.4% novel accuracy on Stanford Mood, surpassing CLIP and GCD by over 50%. Moreover, OAK produces interpretable saliency maps, focusing on hands for Action, faces for Mood, and backgrounds for Location, promoting transparency and trust while enabling adaptive and generalizable categorization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional geometric metrics (Hausdorff, Chamfer distances) fail to capture global statistical structure and are sensitive to outliers, while existing KL divergence approximations for GMMs can be unbounded or numerically unstable.

Method: Represent point clouds as Gaussian Mixture Models on a statistical manifold, prove GMMs form a statistical manifold, and propose Modified Symmetric KL divergence with guaranteed upper/lower bounds for numerical stability.

Result: MSKL provides stable, monotonically varying values that directly reflect geometric variation, outperforming traditional distances and existing KL approximations on human pose (MPI-FAUST) and animal shape (G-PCD) datasets.

Conclusion: The information geometric framework with MSKL divergence offers a robust, numerically stable approach for 3D point cloud shape analysis that better captures statistical structure than traditional geometric metrics.

Abstract: Three-dimensional point clouds provide highly accurate digital representations of objects, essential for applications in computer graphics, photogrammetry, computer vision, and robotics. However, comparing point clouds faces significant challenges due to their unstructured nature and the complex geometry of the surfaces they represent. Traditional geometric metrics such as Hausdorff and Chamfer distances often fail to capture global statistical structure and exhibit sensitivity to outliers, while existing Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence approximations for Gaussian Mixture Models can produce unbounded or numerically unstable values. This paper introduces an information geometric framework for 3D point cloud shape analysis by representing point clouds as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) on a statistical manifold. We prove that the space of GMMs forms a statistical manifold and propose the Modified Symmetric Kullback-Leibler (MSKL) divergence with theoretically guaranteed upper and lower bounds, ensuring numerical stability for all GMM comparisons. Through comprehensive experiments on human pose discrimination (MPI-FAUST dataset) and animal shape comparison (G-PCD dataset), we demonstrate that MSKL provides stable and monotonically varying values that directly reflect geometric variation, outperforming traditional distances and existing KL approximations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based novel view synthesis models lack dedicated learning frameworks to generate high-quality initial noise patterns, which are known to produce better generation results than random noise.

Method: 1) Design discretized Euler inversion method to inject image semantics into random noise, creating paired datasets of random and high-quality noise. 2) Propose encoder-decoder network (EDN) that directly transforms random noise into high-quality noise for NVS models.

Result: EDN can be seamlessly integrated into various NVS models (SV3D, MV-Adapter) and achieves significant performance improvements across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed EDN framework effectively learns to generate high-quality initial noise for diffusion-based novel view synthesis, enhancing generation quality without requiring model architecture changes.

Abstract: Single-view novel view synthesis (NVS) models based on diffusion models have recently attracted increasing attention, as they can generate a series of novel view images from a single image prompt and camera pose information as conditions. It has been observed that in diffusion models, certain high-quality initial noise patterns lead to better generation results than others. However, there remains a lack of dedicated learning frameworks that enable NVS models to learn such high-quality noise. To obtain high-quality initial noise from random Gaussian noise, we make the following contributions. First, we design a discretized Euler inversion method to inject image semantic information into random noise, thereby constructing paired datasets of random and high-quality noise. Second, we propose a learning framework based on an encoder-decoder network (EDN) that directly transforms random noise into high-quality noise. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed EDN can be seamlessly plugged into various NVS models, such as SV3D and MV-Adapter, achieving significant performance improvements across multiple datasets.

TL;DR: SVD-based low-rank image compression is visually acceptable but inefficient compared to standard formats like JPEG, JPEG2000, and WEBP, sometimes even increasing file size at low error levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Images constitute a large portion of internet data, creating significant storage and bandwidth demands that require efficient compression techniques to reduce resource usage.

Method: The study uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and low-rank matrix approximations for image compression, evaluating performance using relative Frobenius error and compression ratio on both grayscale and multichannel images.

Result: Low-rank approximations produce visually similar images to originals, but compression efficiency is consistently worse than established formats (JPEG, JPEG2000, WEBP) at comparable error levels. At low error tolerances, SVD compression can even exceed original image size.

Conclusion: SVD-based low-rank approximation is not competitive with industry-standard codecs for practical image compression, despite producing visually acceptable results, due to poor compression efficiency.

Abstract: Images are a substantial portion of the internet, making efficient compression important for reducing storage and bandwidth demands. This study investigates the use of Singular Value Decomposition and low-rank matrix approximations for image compression, evaluating performance using relative Frobenius error and compression ratio. The approach is applied to both grayscale and multichannel images to assess its generality. Results show that the low-rank approximations often produce images that appear visually similar to the originals, but the compression efficiency remains consistently worse than established formats such as JPEG, JPEG2000, and WEBP at comparable error levels. At low tolerated error levels, the compressed representation produced by Singular Value Decomposition can even exceed the size of the original image, indicating that this method is not competitive with industry-standard codecs for practical image compression.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D human reaction generation methods fail to simultaneously achieve high motion fidelity, real-time inference, and autoregressive adaptability for online scenarios, creating a gap in practical applications.

Method: ARMFlow uses a MeanFlow-based autoregressive framework with causal context encoder and MLP-based velocity predictor, plus Bootstrap Contextual Encoding (BSCE) that encodes generated history instead of ground-truth to reduce error accumulation.

Result: ARMFlow achieves over 40% improvement in FID over existing online methods on InterHuman and InterX datasets, matches offline state-of-the-art performance with only partial sequence conditions, and offers the fastest inference among offline methods via its ReMFlow variant.

Conclusion: ARMFlow successfully addresses the three key challenges of 3D human reaction generation through its autoregressive framework with BSCE, enabling high-fidelity, real-time online generation that outperforms existing methods while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: 3D human reaction generation faces three main challenges:(1) high motion fidelity, (2) real-time inference, and (3) autoregressive adaptability for online scenarios. Existing methods fail to meet all three simultaneously. We propose ARMFlow, a MeanFlow-based autoregressive framework that models temporal dependencies between actor and reactor motions. It consists of a causal context encoder and an MLP-based velocity predictor. We introduce Bootstrap Contextual Encoding (BSCE) in training, encoding generated history instead of the ground-truth ones, to alleviate error accumulation in autoregressive generation. We further introduce the offline variant ReMFlow, achieving state-of-the-art performance with the fastest inference among offline methods. Our ARMFlow addresses key limitations of online settings by: (1) enhancing semantic alignment via a global contextual encoder; (2) achieving high accuracy and low latency in a single-step inference; and (3) reducing accumulated errors through BSCE. Our single-step online generation surpasses existing online methods on InterHuman and InterX by over 40% in FID, while matching offline state-of-the-art performance despite using only partial sequence conditions.

*Tin Stribor Sohn,Maximilian Dillitzer,Jason J. Corso,Eric Sax*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SNOW is a training-free framework that integrates VLM semantics with 3D geometry and temporal dynamics for unified 4D scene understanding, creating queryable 4D Scene Graphs for autonomous robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous robots need spatio-temporal understanding of dynamic environments. Current approaches have limitations: VLMs lack 3D grounding and temporal awareness, while geometric perception lacks semantic richness. There's a need to combine open-world semantics with geometric and temporal understanding.

Method: SNOW processes RGB images and 3D point clouds using HDBSCAN clustering for object proposals, SAM2-based segmentation, and Spatio-Temporal Tokenized Patch Encoding (STEP) to create multimodal tokens. These tokens are integrated into a 4D Scene Graph (4DSG) with a lightweight SLAM backend for spatial anchoring and global reference alignment.

Result: Experiments on diverse benchmarks show SNOW enables precise 4D scene understanding and spatially grounded inference, achieving state-of-the-art performance in several settings.

Conclusion: SNOW demonstrates the importance of structured 4D priors for embodied reasoning and autonomous robotics, providing a unified world model that integrates semantics, geometry, and temporal dynamics for reliable navigation and interaction.

Abstract: Autonomous robotic systems require spatio-temporal understanding of dynamic environments to ensure reliable navigation and interaction. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide open-world semantic priors, they lack grounding in 3D geometry and temporal dynamics. Conversely, geometric perception captures structure and motion but remains semantically sparse. We propose SNOW (Scene Understanding with Open-World Knowledge), a training-free and backbone-agnostic framework for unified 4D scene understanding that integrates VLM-derived semantics with point cloud geometry and temporal consistency. SNOW processes synchronized RGB images and 3D point clouds, using HDBSCAN clustering to generate object-level proposals that guide SAM2-based segmentation. Each segmented region is encoded through our proposed Spatio-Temporal Tokenized Patch Encoding (STEP), producing multimodal tokens that capture localized semantic, geometric, and temporal attributes. These tokens are incrementally integrated into a 4D Scene Graph (4DSG), which serves as 4D prior for downstream reasoning. A lightweight SLAM backend anchors all STEP tokens spatially in the environment, providing the global reference alignment, and ensuring unambiguous spatial grounding across time. The resulting 4DSG forms a queryable, unified world model through which VLMs can directly interpret spatial scene structure and temporal dynamics. Experiments on a diverse set of benchmarks demonstrate that SNOW enables precise 4D scene understanding and spatially grounded inference, thereby setting new state-of-the-art performance in several settings, highlighting the importance of structured 4D priors for embodied reasoning and autonomous robotics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoPredict enhances VLA models with predictive 3D geometric reasoning for better robotic manipulation, using training-time supervision without 3D decoding at inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language-Action models are largely reactive and 2D-centric, making them unreliable for tasks requiring precise 3D reasoning in robotic manipulation.

Method: Introduces a geometry-aware VLA framework with two predictive modules: trajectory-level encoding of motion history with 3D keypoint trajectory prediction, and predictive 3D Gaussian geometry forecasting with track-guided refinement. Uses depth-based rendering for training supervision only.

Result: Consistently outperforms strong VLA baselines on RoboCasa Human-50, LIBERO, and real-world manipulation tasks, especially in geometry-intensive and spatially demanding scenarios.

Conclusion: GeoPredict successfully addresses the 3D reasoning limitations of current VLA models through predictive geometric priors, achieving better performance in complex manipulation tasks while maintaining efficient inference.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models achieve strong generalization in robotic manipulation but remain largely reactive and 2D-centric, making them unreliable in tasks that require precise 3D reasoning. We propose GeoPredict, a geometry-aware VLA framework that augments a continuous-action policy with predictive kinematic and geometric priors. GeoPredict introduces a trajectory-level module that encodes motion history and predicts multi-step 3D keypoint trajectories of robot arms, and a predictive 3D Gaussian geometry module that forecasts workspace geometry with track-guided refinement along future keypoint trajectories. These predictive modules serve exclusively as training-time supervision through depth-based rendering, while inference requires only lightweight additional query tokens without invoking any 3D decoding. Experiments on RoboCasa Human-50, LIBERO, and real-world manipulation tasks show that GeoPredict consistently outperforms strong VLA baselines, especially in geometry-intensive and spatially demanding scenarios.

*Qi Zhang,Yunfei Gong,Zhidan Xie,Zhizi Wang,Antoni B. Chan,Hui Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes two semi-supervised multi-view crowd counting frameworks using model ranking constraints to address limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-view crowd counting suffers from limited datasets due to difficulty in collecting and annotating multi-view images, requiring solutions that work with less labeled data.

Method: Two semi-supervised frameworks: 1) Vanilla model ranking based on prediction consistency (predictions with fewer views ≤ predictions with more views), 2) Uncertainty ranking based on model uncertainties (uncertainties with more views ≤ uncertainties with fewer views), both using ranking constraints in training.

Result: Experiments show advantages over other semi-supervised counting methods.

Conclusion: The proposed model ranking approaches effectively leverage limited labeled data for multi-view crowd counting through semi-supervised constraints.

Abstract: Multi-view crowd counting has been proposed to deal with the severe occlusion issue of crowd counting in large and wide scenes. However, due to the difficulty of collecting and annotating multi-view images, the datasets for multi-view counting have a limited number of multi-view frames and scenes. To solve the problem of limited data, one approach is to collect synthetic data to bypass the annotating step, while another is to propose semi- or weakly-supervised or unsupervised methods that demand less multi-view data. In this paper, we propose two semi-supervised multi-view crowd counting frameworks by ranking the multi-view fusion models of different numbers of input views, in terms of the model predictions or the model uncertainties. Specifically, for the first method (vanilla model), we rank the multi-view fusion models' prediction results of different numbers of camera-view inputs, namely, the model's predictions with fewer camera views shall not be larger than the predictions with more camera views. For the second method, we rank the estimated model uncertainties of the multi-view fusion models with a variable number of view inputs, guided by the multi-view fusion models' prediction errors, namely, the model uncertainties with more camera views shall not be larger than those with fewer camera views. These constraints are introduced into the model training in a semi-supervised fashion for multi-view counting with limited labeled data. The experiments demonstrate the advantages of the proposed multi-view model ranking methods compared with other semi-supervised counting methods.

TL;DR: OpenTouch is the first in-the-wild egocentric full-hand tactile dataset with synchronized video-touch-pose data, enabling research on how touch grounds perception and action.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite hands being our primary interface with the physical world, egocentric perception lacks understanding of when, where, and how forcefully hands make contact. There's a gap between visual perception and physical interaction, with no existing in-the-wild datasets aligning first-person video with full-hand touch.

Method: Created OpenTouch dataset containing 5.1 hours of synchronized video-touch-pose data and 2,900 curated clips with detailed text annotations. Introduced retrieval and classification benchmarks to probe how touch grounds perception and action.

Result: Tactile signals provide compact yet powerful cues for grasp understanding, strengthen cross-modal alignment, and can be reliably retrieved from in-the-wild video queries.

Conclusion: By releasing this annotated vision-touch-pose dataset and benchmark, the authors aim to advance multimodal egocentric perception, embodied learning, and contact-rich robotic manipulation.

Abstract: The human hand is our primary interface to the physical world, yet egocentric perception rarely knows when, where, or how forcefully it makes contact. Robust wearable tactile sensors are scarce, and no existing in-the-wild datasets align first-person video with full-hand touch.

TL;DR: FLIM_PSR_k is a deep learning framework that uses conditional GANs to achieve 5× pixel super-resolution for FLIM imaging, enabling faster acquisition and higher resolution without hardware changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical adoption of FLIM is limited by long pixel dwell times and low SNR, creating a strict resolution-speed trade-off that hinders real-time diagnostics.

Method: Conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) framework for multi-channel pixel super-resolution that reconstructs high-resolution FLIM images from data acquired with up to 5× larger pixel sizes.

Result: Achieves 5× super-resolution factor, 25× increase in space-bandwidth product, reveals fine architectural features in tumor tissue, with statistically significant improvements in image quality metrics and substantially shorter inference times than diffusion models.

Conclusion: FLIM_PSR_k advances FLIM toward faster, higher-resolution implementations compatible with low-NA and miniaturized platforms, better positioning it for translational clinical applications.

Abstract: Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) is a powerful quantitative technique that provides metabolic and molecular contrast, offering strong translational potential for label-free, real-time diagnostics. However, its clinical adoption remains limited by long pixel dwell times and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which impose a stricter resolution-speed trade-off than conventional optical imaging approaches. Here, we introduce FLIM_PSR_k, a deep learning-based multi-channel pixel super-resolution (PSR) framework that reconstructs high-resolution FLIM images from data acquired with up to a 5-fold increased pixel size. The model is trained using the conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) framework, which, compared to diffusion model-based alternatives, delivers a more robust PSR reconstruction with substantially shorter inference times, a crucial advantage for practical deployment. FLIM_PSR_k not only enables faster image acquisition but can also alleviate SNR limitations in autofluorescence-based FLIM. Blind testing on held-out patient-derived tumor tissue samples demonstrates that FLIM_PSR_k reliably achieves a super-resolution factor of k = 5, resulting in a 25-fold increase in the space-bandwidth product of the output images and revealing fine architectural features lost in lower-resolution inputs, with statistically significant improvements across various image quality metrics. By increasing FLIM's effective spatial resolution, FLIM_PSR_k advances lifetime imaging toward faster, higher-resolution, and hardware-flexible implementations compatible with low-numerical-aperture and miniaturized platforms, better positioning FLIM for translational applications.

Motivation: Existing 3D hand trajectory prediction methods are limited by datasets that separate motion from semantic supervision, and models that weakly connect reasoning with action.

Method: 1) Create EgoMAN dataset with 219K 6DoF trajectories and 3M structured QA pairs for semantic/spatial/motion reasoning. 2) Develop EgoMAN model using reasoning-to-motion framework with trajectory-token interface, trained progressively to align reasoning with motion dynamics.

Conclusion: EgoMAN addresses limitations of prior work by integrating semantic reasoning with motion prediction through a novel dataset and framework, enabling better generalization to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Prior works on 3D hand trajectory prediction are constrained by datasets that decouple motion from semantic supervision and by models that weakly link reasoning and action. To address these, we first present the EgoMAN dataset, a large-scale egocentric dataset for interaction stage-aware 3D hand trajectory prediction with 219K 6DoF trajectories and 3M structured QA pairs for semantic, spatial, and motion reasoning. We then introduce the EgoMAN model, a reasoning-to-motion framework that links vision-language reasoning and motion generation via a trajectory-token interface. Trained progressively to align reasoning with motion dynamics, our approach yields accurate and stage-aware trajectories with generalization across real-world scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text editing in images remains largely unexplored despite being a challenging frontier in visual generation, requiring legible character generation while preserving semantic, geometric, and contextual coherence.

Method: Introduces TextEditBench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark focusing on text-centric regions in images, emphasizing reasoning-intensive editing scenarios and proposing Semantic Expectation (SE) as a novel evaluation dimension.

Result: Extensive experiments show current models can follow simple textual instructions but struggle with context-dependent reasoning, physical consistency, and layout-aware integration.

Conclusion: TextEditBench establishes a new testing ground for advancing text-guided image editing and reasoning in multimodal generation by focusing on this fundamental but overlooked capability.

Abstract: Text rendering has recently emerged as one of the most challenging frontiers in visual generation, drawing significant attention from large-scale diffusion and multimodal models. However, text editing within images remains largely unexplored, as it requires generating legible characters while preserving semantic, geometric, and contextual coherence. To fill this gap, we introduce TextEditBench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark that explicitly focuses on text-centric regions in images. Beyond basic pixel manipulations, our benchmark emphasizes reasoning-intensive editing scenarios that require models to understand physical plausibility, linguistic meaning, and cross-modal dependencies. We further propose a novel evaluation dimension, Semantic Expectation (SE), which measures reasoning ability of model to maintain semantic consistency, contextual coherence, and cross-modal alignment during text editing. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art editing systems reveal that while current models can follow simple textual instructions, they still struggle with context-dependent reasoning, physical consistency, and layout-aware integration. By focusing evaluation on this long-overlooked yet fundamental capability, TextEditBench establishes a new testing ground for advancing text-guided image editing and reasoning in multimodal generation.

TL;DR: MomaGraph: A unified scene graph representation for household mobile manipulators that integrates spatial-functional relationships and part-level interactions, with a dataset, benchmark, and 7B VLM model achieving SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile manipulators in households need compact, semantically rich scene representations that capture object locations, functions, and actionable parts. Prior work separates spatial/functional relations, treats scenes as static, and overlooks task-relevant information.

Method: Introduces MomaGraph unified scene representation, creates MomaGraph-Scenes dataset (large-scale annotated task-driven scene graphs), MomaGraph-Bench evaluation suite (6 reasoning capabilities), and MomaGraph-R1 (7B vision-language model trained with RL on the dataset).

Result: MomaGraph-R1 achieves 71.6% accuracy on the benchmark (+11.4% over best baseline), shows state-of-the-art results among open-source models, generalizes across public benchmarks, and transfers effectively to real-robot experiments.

Conclusion: MomaGraph provides a comprehensive solution for embodied agents with unified scene representation, dataset, benchmark, and model that advances task-oriented scene understanding and planning for household mobile manipulation.

Abstract: Mobile manipulators in households must both navigate and manipulate. This requires a compact, semantically rich scene representation that captures where objects are, how they function, and which parts are actionable. Scene graphs are a natural choice, yet prior work often separates spatial and functional relations, treats scenes as static snapshots without object states or temporal updates, and overlooks information most relevant for accomplishing the current task. To address these limitations, we introduce MomaGraph, a unified scene representation for embodied agents that integrates spatial-functional relationships and part-level interactive elements. However, advancing such a representation requires both suitable data and rigorous evaluation, which have been largely missing. We thus contribute MomaGraph-Scenes, the first large-scale dataset of richly annotated, task-driven scene graphs in household environments, along with MomaGraph-Bench, a systematic evaluation suite spanning six reasoning capabilities from high-level planning to fine-grained scene understanding. Built upon this foundation, we further develop MomaGraph-R1, a 7B vision-language model trained with reinforcement learning on MomaGraph-Scenes. MomaGraph-R1 predicts task-oriented scene graphs and serves as a zero-shot task planner under a Graph-then-Plan framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source models, reaching 71.6% accuracy on the benchmark (+11.4% over the best baseline), while generalizing across public benchmarks and transferring effectively to real-robot experiments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GFLAN is a two-stage generative framework for floor plan synthesis that separates topological planning from geometric realization, addressing architectural reasoning challenges in automated layout generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning approaches struggle to capture architectural reasoning principles like topological precedence over geometry, functional constraint propagation, and circulation pattern emergence from connectivity decisions.

Method: Two-stage decomposition: Stage A uses dual-encoder convolutional architecture to sequentially allocate room centroids via probability maps; Stage B constructs heterogeneous graph and applies Transformer-augmented GNN to jointly regress room boundaries.

Result: Not specified in the abstract (paper introduces the framework but doesn't report experimental results in the provided text).

Conclusion: GFLAN restructures floor plan synthesis through explicit factorization into topological planning and geometric realization, offering a principled approach to address fundamental architectural reasoning challenges.

Abstract: Automated floor plan generation lies at the intersection of combinatorial search, geometric constraint satisfaction, and functional design requirements -- a confluence that has historically resisted a unified computational treatment. While recent deep learning approaches have improved the state of the art, they often struggle to capture architectural reasoning: the precedence of topological relationships over geometric instantiation, the propagation of functional constraints through adjacency networks, and the emergence of circulation patterns from local connectivity decisions. To address these fundamental challenges, this paper introduces GFLAN, a generative framework that restructures floor plan synthesis through explicit factorization into topological planning and geometric realization. Given a single exterior boundary and a front-door location, our approach departs from direct pixel-to-pixel or wall-tracing generation in favor of a principled two-stage decomposition. Stage A employs a specialized convolutional architecture with dual encoders -- separating invariant spatial context from evolving layout state -- to sequentially allocate room centroids within the building envelope via discrete probability maps over feasible placements. Stage B constructs a heterogeneous graph linking room nodes to boundary vertices, then applies a Transformer-augmented graph neural network (GNN) that jointly regresses room boundaries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a lack of driving-targeted dense geometry perception models that can adapt to different scenarios and camera configurations, requiring flexible approaches that don't rely on precise camera parameters.

Method: Uses DINO backbone for visual feature extraction, then employs alternating intra-view local attention, cross-view spatial attention, and cross-frame temporal attention to infer geometric relations. Multiple heads decode global point maps and ego poses directly from image sequences.

Result: DVGT significantly outperforms existing models on various driving scenarios, trained on a large mixture of datasets including nuScenes, OpenScene, Waymo, KITTI, and DDAD.

Conclusion: DVGT enables flexible 3D geometry reconstruction from arbitrary camera configurations without explicit geometric priors, directly predicting metric-scaled geometry without post-alignment with external sensors.

Abstract: Perceiving and reconstructing 3D scene geometry from visual inputs is crucial for autonomous driving. However, there still lacks a driving-targeted dense geometry perception model that can adapt to different scenarios and camera configurations. To bridge this gap, we propose a Driving Visual Geometry Transformer (DVGT), which reconstructs a global dense 3D point map from a sequence of unposed multi-view visual inputs. We first extract visual features for each image using a DINO backbone, and employ alternating intra-view local attention, cross-view spatial attention, and cross-frame temporal attention to infer geometric relations across images. We then use multiple heads to decode a global point map in the ego coordinate of the first frame and the ego poses for each frame. Unlike conventional methods that rely on precise camera parameters, DVGT is free of explicit 3D geometric priors, enabling flexible processing of arbitrary camera configurations. DVGT directly predicts metric-scaled geometry from image sequences, eliminating the need for post-alignment with external sensors. Trained on a large mixture of driving datasets including nuScenes, OpenScene, Waymo, KITTI, and DDAD, DVGT significantly outperforms existing models on various scenarios.

TL;DR: LaverNet is a lightweight all-in-one video restoration network with only 362K parameters that addresses degradation interference in temporal modeling through selective degradation-agnostic feature propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing all-in-one video restoration models face two key challenges: (1) degradations can dominate temporal modeling, confusing models to focus on artifacts rather than content, and (2) current methods rely on large models that conceal underlying difficulties.

Method: Proposes LaverNet with a novel propagation mechanism that selectively transmits only degradation-agnostic features across frames to mitigate degradation impact on temporal modeling, achieving all-in-one restoration with only 362K parameters.

Result: Despite being less than 1% of existing models' parameters, LaverNet achieves comparable and even superior performance across benchmarks, demonstrating strong all-in-one restoration with a compact network.

Conclusion: Lightweight all-in-one video restoration is achievable with selective degradation-agnostic feature propagation, challenging the assumption that large models are necessary for handling multiple degradations.

Abstract: Recent studies have explored all-in-one video restoration, which handles multiple degradations with a unified model. However, these approaches still face two challenges when dealing with time-varying degradations. First, the degradation can dominate temporal modeling, confusing the model to focus on artifacts rather than the video content. Second, current methods typically rely on large models to handle all-in-one restoration, concealing those underlying difficulties. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight all-in-one video restoration network, LaverNet, with only 362K parameters. To mitigate the impact of degradations on temporal modeling, we introduce a novel propagation mechanism that selectively transmits only degradation-agnostic features across frames. Through LaverNet, we demonstrate that strong all-in-one restoration can be achieved with a compact network. Despite its small size, less than 1\% of the parameters of existing models, LaverNet achieves comparable, even superior performance across benchmarks.

Method: Fusion localization method using ridge estimation to combine sequential imagery (rich scene information) with laser ranging (high precision), addressing multicollinearity in design matrix under limited observation conditions.

Result: Method achieves higher localization accuracy than ground localization algorithms using single information sources, with ridge estimation effectively enhancing robustness under limited observation conditions.

Conclusion: Ridge estimation-based fusion approach successfully improves UAV target localization accuracy and robustness by mitigating multicollinearity issues in challenging observation scenarios.

Abstract: Tracking and measuring targets using a variety of sensors mounted on UAVs is an effective means to quickly and accurately locate the target. This paper proposes a fusion localization method based on ridge estimation, combining the advantages of rich scene information from sequential imagery with the high precision of laser ranging to enhance localization accuracy. Under limited conditions such as long distances, small intersection angles, and large inclination angles, the column vectors of the design matrix have serious multicollinearity when using the least squares estimation algorithm. The multicollinearity will lead to ill-conditioned problems, resulting in significant instability and low robustness. Ridge estimation is introduced to mitigate the serious multicollinearity under the condition of limited observation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves higher localization accuracy compared to ground localization algorithms based on single information. Moreover, the introduction of ridge estimation effectively enhances the robustness, particularly under limited observation conditions.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of achieving optimal Quality of Information (QoI) in non-dedicated vehicular mobile crowdsensing (NVMCS) systems. The key obstacles are the interrelated issues of sensing coverage, sensing reliability, and the dynamic participation of vehicles. To tackle these, we propose QUIDS, a QUality-informed Incentive-driven multi-agent Dispatching System, which ensures high sensing coverage and reliability under budget constraints. QUIDS introduces a novel metric, Aggregated Sensing Quality (ASQ), to quantitatively capture QoI by integrating both coverage and reliability. We also develop a Mutually Assisted Belief-aware Vehicle Dispatching algorithm that estimates sensing reliability and allocates incentives under uncertainty, further improving ASQ. Evaluation using real-world data from a metropolitan NVMCS deployment shows QUIDS improves ASQ by 38% over non-dispatching scenarios and by 10% over state-of-the-art methods. It also reduces reconstruction map errors by 39-74% across algorithms. By jointly optimizing coverage and reliability via a quality-informed incentive mechanism, QUIDS enables low-cost, high-quality urban monitoring without dedicated infrastructure, applicable to smart-city scenarios like traffic and environmental sensing.

*Soochang Song,Yongjune Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Collaborative edge-to-server VLM framework reduces communication cost by selectively requesting detail-preserved local images only when needed, maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional VLM deployments transmit full images from edge to server, but resizing loses fine-grained details, causing accuracy degradation. Need to reduce communication cost while preserving accuracy.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Server infers on global image, identifies RoI using VLM attention, computes min-entropy confidence measure; 2) If confidence low (min-entropy high), requests detail-preserved local RoI from edge, then refines inference using both global and local images.

Result: Experiments across multiple VLM architectures show significant reduction in communication cost while maintaining inference accuracy.

Conclusion: Selective retransmission strategy effectively reduces communication overhead in edge-to-server VLM inference without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: We propose a collaborative edge-to-server inference framework for vision-language models (VLMs) that reduces the communication cost while maintaining inference accuracy. In typical deployments, visual data captured at edge devices (clients) is transmitted to the server for VLM inference. However, resizing the original image (global image) to match the vision encoder's input resolution often discards fine-grained details, leading to accuracy degradation. To overcome this limitation, we design a two-stage framework. In the first stage, the server performs inference on the global image and identifies a region of interest (RoI) using the VLM's internal attention. The min-entropy of the output tokens is then computed as a confidence measure to determine whether retransmission is required. If the min-entropy exceeds a predefined threshold, the server requests the edge device to send a detail-preserved local image of the RoI. The server then refines its inference by jointly leveraging the global and local images. This selective retransmission strategy ensures that only essential visual content is transmitted. Experiments across multiple VLM architectures show that the proposed framework significantly reduces communication cost while maintaining inference accuracy.

*Tao Hu,Weiyu Zhou,Yanjie Tu,Peng Wu,Wei Dong,Qingsen Yan,Yanning Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GMODiff: A one-step diffusion framework using gain maps for efficient multi-exposure HDR reconstruction, addressing limitations of existing LDM approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained LDMs show promise for HDR reconstruction but face challenges: limited dynamic range representation from 8-bit latent compression, high inference cost from multi-step denoising, and content hallucination issues.

Method: Reformulates HDR reconstruction as gain map estimation, initializes denoising from regression-based estimates for one-step generation, and uses regression priors to guide both denoising and latent decoding to suppress hallucinations while maintaining structural accuracy.

Result: GMODiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is 100× faster than previous LDM-based approaches while maintaining high quality.

Conclusion: The proposed gain map-driven one-step diffusion framework effectively addresses key challenges in applying LDMs to HDR reconstruction, achieving superior performance with dramatically reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Pre-trained Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) have recently shown strong perceptual priors for low-level vision tasks, making them a promising direction for multi-exposure High Dynamic Range (HDR) reconstruction. However, directly applying LDMs to HDR remains challenging due to: (1) limited dynamic-range representation caused by 8-bit latent compression, (2) high inference cost from multi-step denoising, and (3) content hallucination inherent to generative nature. To address these challenges, we introduce GMODiff, a gain map-driven one-step diffusion framework for multi-exposure HDR reconstruction. Instead of reconstructing full HDR content, we reformulate HDR reconstruction as a conditionally guided Gain Map (GM) estimation task, where the GM encodes the extended dynamic range while retaining the same bit depth as LDR images. We initialize the denoising process from an informative regression-based estimate rather than pure noise, enabling the model to generate high-quality GMs in a single denoising step. Furthermore, recognizing that regression-based models excel in content fidelity while LDMs favor perceptual quality, we leverage regression priors to guide both the denoising process and latent decoding of the LDM, suppressing hallucinations while preserving structural accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our GMODiff performs favorably against several state-of-the-art methods and is 100 faster than previous LDM-based methods.

*Haotian Ling,Zequn Chen,Qiuying Chen,Donglin Di,Yongjia Ma,Hao Li,Chen Wei,Zhulin Tao,Xun Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EverybodyDance addresses identity correspondence in multi-character animation using graph-based matching and targeted strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pose-driven animation works well for single characters but struggles with multi-character scenarios, especially when characters swap positions. The core challenge is maintaining correct identity correspondence between reference and generated frames.

Method: Proposes Identity Matching Graph (IMG) modeling characters as nodes in bipartite graph, Mask-Query Attention (MQA) for affinity computation, identity-embedded guidance, multi-scale matching, and pre-classified sampling strategies.

Result: Substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both identity correspondence correctness and visual fidelity on the curated Identity Correspondence Evaluation benchmark.

Conclusion: EverybodyDance provides a systematic solution for multi-character animation with correct identity correspondence through graph-based formalization and synergistic strategies.

Abstract: Consistent pose-driven character animation has achieved remarkable progress in single-character scenarios. However, extending these advances to multi-character settings is non-trivial, especially when position swap is involved. Beyond mere scaling, the core challenge lies in enforcing correct Identity Correspondence (IC) between characters in reference and generated frames. To address this, we introduce EverybodyDance, a systematic solution targeting IC correctness in multi-character animation. EverybodyDance is built around the Identity Matching Graph (IMG), which models characters in the generated and reference frames as two node sets in a weighted complete bipartite graph. Edge weights, computed via our proposed Mask-Query Attention (MQA), quantify the affinity between each pair of characters. Our key insight is to formalize IC correctness as a graph structural metric and to optimize it during training. We also propose a series of targeted strategies tailored for multi-character animation, including identity-embedded guidance, a multi-scale matching strategy, and pre-classified sampling, which work synergistically. Finally, to evaluate IC performance, we curate the Identity Correspondence Evaluation benchmark, dedicated to multi-character IC correctness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EverybodyDance substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both IC and visual fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FVG decomposes T2V generation into 3 stages: LLM reasoning for initial scene description, T2I composition for anchor frame, and temporal synthesis for animation, improving quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2V models often fail at complex scene composition and logical temporal instructions, with many errors stemming from inability to create semantically correct initial frames.

Method: Factorized Video Generation pipeline with 3 specialized stages: 1) LLM reasoning to rewrite prompts for initial scene description, 2) T2I model for high-quality anchor frame synthesis, 3) video model finetuned to animate from anchor.

Result: Sets new SOTA on T2V CompBench, significantly improves all tested models on VBench2, enables 70% reduction in sampling steps without performance loss, leading to substantial speed-up.

Conclusion: Factorized Video Generation offers a practical path toward more efficient, robust, and controllable video synthesis by decoupling scene composition from temporal animation.

Abstract: State-of-the-art Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models can generate visually impressive results, yet they still frequently fail to compose complex scenes or follow logical temporal instructions. In this paper, we argue that many errors, including apparent motion failures, originate from the model's inability to construct a semantically correct or logically consistent initial frame. We introduce Factorized Video Generation (FVG), a pipeline that decouples these tasks by decomposing the Text-to-Video generation into three specialized stages: (1) Reasoning, where a Large Language Model (LLM) rewrites the video prompt to describe only the initial scene, resolving temporal ambiguities; (2) Composition, where a Text-to-Image (T2I) model synthesizes a high-quality, compositionally-correct anchor frame from this new prompt; and (3) Temporal Synthesis, where a video model, finetuned to understand this anchor, focuses its entire capacity on animating the scene and following the prompt. Our decomposed approach sets a new state-of-the-art on the T2V CompBench benchmark and significantly improves all tested models on VBench2. Furthermore, we show that visual anchoring allows us to cut the number of sampling steps by 70% without any loss in performance, leading to a substantial speed-up in sampling. Factorized Video Generation offers a simple yet practical path toward more efficient, robust, and controllable video synthesis

TL;DR: AFDAN is a domain adaptation framework that aligns features in the frequency domain to address medical image segmentation data scarcity, achieving state-of-the-art results on vitiligo and retinal vessel segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation suffers from scarce high-quality annotated data due to time-consuming manual annotation, creating a need for effective domain adaptation methods to transfer knowledge from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains.

Method: AFDAN integrates three core components: 1) Adversarial Domain Learning Module for feature transfer, 2) Source-Target Frequency Fusion Module for blending frequency representations, and 3) Spatial-Frequency Integration Module for combining frequency and spatial features to enhance cross-domain segmentation.

Result: AFDAN achieves 90.9% IoU on the new VITILIGO2025 dataset and 82.6% IoU on the DRIVE retinal vessel segmentation benchmark, surpassing existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: AFDAN effectively addresses medical image segmentation data scarcity through frequency domain alignment and cross-domain knowledge transfer, demonstrating superior performance on challenging segmentation tasks.

Abstract: High-quality annotated data plays a crucial role in achieving accurate segmentation. However, such data for medical image segmentation are often scarce due to the time-consuming and labor-intensive nature of manual annotation. To address this challenge, we propose the Adaptive Frequency Domain Alignment Network (AFDAN)--a novel domain adaptation framework designed to align features in the frequency domain and alleviate data scarcity. AFDAN integrates three core components to enable robust cross-domain knowledge transfer: an Adversarial Domain Learning Module that transfers features from the source to the target domain; a Source-Target Frequency Fusion Module that blends frequency representations across domains; and a Spatial-Frequency Integration Module that combines both frequency and spatial features to further enhance segmentation accuracy across domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of AFDAN: it achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 90.9% for vitiligo segmentation in the newly constructed VITILIGO2025 dataset and a competitive IoU of 82.6% on the retinal vessel segmentation benchmark DRIVE, surpassing existing state-of-the-art approaches.

*Haodi He,Jihun Yu,Ronald Fedkiw*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method that uses 3D Gaussian Splatting to create consistent facial reconstructions from uncalibrated images, producing triangulated surfaces and neural textures for standard graphics pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create unified 3D facial reconstructions from uncalibrated images that can be used in standard graphics pipelines, addressing the need for efficient reconstruction from limited data and compatibility with existing workflows.

Method: Uses Gaussian Splatting with segmentation annotations for semantic alignment, constrains Gaussians to triangulated surfaces for structure, transforms splats into view-dependent neural textures, and employs relightable models for albedo extraction.

Result: Achieves facial reconstruction from only 11 images (vs. long videos), produces triangulated surfaces and high-resolution albedo textures compatible with standard graphics pipelines, and enables text-driven asset creation.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges neural representations with traditional graphics pipelines, enabling high-fidelity facial reconstruction from sparse data while maintaining compatibility with existing workflows and supporting text-driven asset creation.

Abstract: We leverage increasingly popular three-dimensional neural representations in order to construct a unified and consistent explanation of a collection of uncalibrated images of the human face. Our approach utilizes Gaussian Splatting, since it is more explicit and thus more amenable to constraints than NeRFs. We leverage segmentation annotations to align the semantic regions of the face, facilitating the reconstruction of a neutral pose from only 11 images (as opposed to requiring a long video). We soft constrain the Gaussians to an underlying triangulated surface in order to provide a more structured Gaussian Splat reconstruction, which in turn informs subsequent perturbations to increase the accuracy of the underlying triangulated surface. The resulting triangulated surface can then be used in a standard graphics pipeline. In addition, and perhaps most impactful, we show how accurate geometry enables the Gaussian Splats to be transformed into texture space where they can be treated as a view-dependent neural texture. This allows one to use high visual fidelity Gaussian Splatting on any asset in a scene without the need to modify any other asset or any other aspect (geometry, lighting, renderer, etc.) of the graphics pipeline. We utilize a relightable Gaussian model to disentangle texture from lighting in order to obtain a delit high-resolution albedo texture that is also readily usable in a standard graphics pipeline. The flexibility of our system allows for training with disparate images, even with incompatible lighting, facilitating robust regularization. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by illustrating its use in a text-driven asset creation pipeline.

TL;DR: BrepLLM enables LLMs to process 3D Boundary Representation models via cross-modal alignment and multi-stage fine-tuning, achieving SOTA on 3D classification and captioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with 3D Brep models containing complex geometric/topological information, creating a modality gap between structured 3D geometry and natural language.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) Cross-modal alignment pre-training with adaptive UV sampling, hierarchical BrepEncoder, and CLIP contrastive learning; 2) Multi-stage LLM fine-tuning with semantic mapping, LLM fine-tuning, and Mixture-of-Query Experts for geometric diversity.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on 3D object classification and captioning tasks, demonstrating effective bridging of 3D geometry and language modalities.

Conclusion: BrepLLM successfully enables LLMs to parse and reason over raw Brep data, bridging the gap between 3D geometric representations and natural language understanding.

Abstract: Current token-sequence-based Large Language Models (LLMs) are not well-suited for directly processing 3D Boundary Representation (Brep) models that contain complex geometric and topological information. We propose BrepLLM, the first framework that enables LLMs to parse and reason over raw Brep data, bridging the modality gap between structured 3D geometry and natural language. BrepLLM employs a two-stage training pipeline: Cross-modal Alignment Pre-training and Multi-stage LLM Fine-tuning. In the first stage, an adaptive UV sampling strategy converts Breps into graphs representation with geometric and topological information. We then design a hierarchical BrepEncoder to extract features from geometry (i.e., faces and edges) and topology, producing both a single global token and a sequence of node tokens. Then we align the global token with text embeddings from a frozen CLIP text encoder (ViT-L/14) via contrastive learning. In the second stage, we integrate the pretrained BrepEncoder into an LLM. We then align its sequence of node tokens using a three-stage progressive training strategy: (1) training an MLP-based semantic mapping from Brep representation to 2D with 2D-LLM priors. (2) performing fine-tuning of the LLM. (3) designing a Mixture-of-Query Experts (MQE) to enhance geometric diversity modeling. We also construct Brep2Text, a dataset comprising 269,444 Brep-text question-answer pairs. Experiments show that BrepLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on 3D object classification and captioning tasks.

*Muhammad Ibraheem Siddiqui,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CountZES is a training-free framework for zero-shot object counting that progressively discovers diverse exemplars through three synergistic stages to accurately count unseen object categories specified only by class names.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot object counting methods have limitations: open-vocabulary detectors produce multi-instance candidates, while random patch sampling fails to accurately delineate object instances. There's a need for better exemplar selection in zero-shot counting scenarios.

Method: CountZES uses three progressive stages: 1) Detection-Anchored Exemplar (DAE) refines open-vocabulary detections to isolate single-instance exemplars; 2) Density-Guided Exemplar (DGE) uses density-driven self-supervised paradigm to identify statistically consistent exemplars; 3) Feature-Consensus Exemplar (FCE) reinforces visual coherence through feature-space clustering.

Result: Experiments on diverse datasets show CountZES achieves superior performance among zero-shot object counting methods and generalizes effectively across natural, aerial, and medical domains.

Conclusion: CountZES provides an effective training-free framework for zero-shot object counting that balances textual grounding, count consistency, and feature representativeness through progressive exemplar discovery, outperforming existing methods across multiple domains.

Abstract: Object counting in complex scenes remains challenging, particularly in the zero-shot setting, where the goal is to count instances of unseen categories specified only by a class name. Existing zero-shot object counting (ZOC) methods that infer exemplars from text either rely on open-vocabulary detectors, which often yield multi-instance candidates, or on random patch sampling, which fails to accurately delineate object instances. To address this, we propose CountZES, a training-free framework for object counting via zero-shot exemplar selection. CountZES progressively discovers diverse exemplars through three synergistic stages: Detection-Anchored Exemplar (DAE), Density-Guided Exemplar (DGE), and Feature-Consensus Exemplar (FCE). DAE refines open-vocabulary detections to isolate precise single-instance exemplars. DGE introduces a density-driven, self-supervised paradigm to identify statistically consistent and semantically compact exemplars, while FCE reinforces visual coherence through feature-space clustering. Together, these stages yield a diverse, complementary exemplar set that balances textual grounding, count consistency, and feature representativeness. Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate CountZES superior performance among ZOC methods while generalizing effectively across natural, aerial and medical domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models struggle with subject consistency across multiple outputs for visual storytelling. Existing approaches require computationally expensive fine-tuning or suffer from semantic leakage in training-free methods like 1Prompt1Story.

Method: Proposes a simple training-free approach that refines text embeddings from a geometric perspective to suppress unwanted semantics and address semantic entanglement, without requiring model fine-tuning or per-subject optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach significantly improves both subject consistency and text alignment over existing baselines, effectively reducing semantic leakage while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The geometric perspective-based text embedding refinement provides an effective training-free solution for improving subject consistency in text-to-image diffusion models, addressing limitations of previous methods while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images from natural language descriptions but often fail to preserve subject consistency across multiple outputs, limiting their use in visual storytelling. Existing approaches rely on model fine-tuning or image conditioning, which are computationally expensive and require per-subject optimization. 1Prompt1Story, a training-free approach, concatenates all scene descriptions into a single prompt and rescales token embeddings, but it suffers from semantic leakage, where embeddings across frames become entangled, causing text misalignment. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective training-free approach that addresses semantic entanglement from a geometric perspective by refining text embeddings to suppress unwanted semantics. Extensive experiments prove that our approach significantly improves both subject consistency and text alignment over existing baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generate realistic human motion that imitates natural gaze priming behavior - spotting objects/locations from a distance before approaching and reaching them.

Method: Curated 23.7K gaze-primed motion sequences from 5 public datasets, pre-trained a text-conditioned diffusion model, then fine-tuned it conditioned on goal pose/location.

Result: Achieved 60% prime success (new metric) and 89% reach success on HD-EPIC dataset when conditioned on goal object location.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully generates realistic gaze-primed human reaching motions, demonstrating the effectiveness of diffusion models for this challenging task.

Abstract: Human motion generation is a challenging task that aims to create realistic motion imitating natural human behaviour. We focus on the well-studied behaviour of priming an object/location for pick up or put down -- that is, the spotting of an object/location from a distance, known as gaze priming, followed by the motion of approaching and reaching the target location. To that end, we curate, for the first time, 23.7K gaze-primed human motion sequences for reaching target object locations from five publicly available datasets, i.e., HD-EPIC, MoGaze, HOT3D, ADT, and GIMO. We pre-train a text-conditioned diffusion-based motion generation model, then fine-tune it conditioned on goal pose or location, on our curated sequences. Importantly, we evaluate the ability of the generated motion to imitate natural human movement through several metrics, including the 'Reach Success' and a newly introduced 'Prime Success' metric. On the largest dataset, HD-EPIC, our model achieves 60% prime success and 89% reach success when conditioned on the goal object location.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StageVAR is a stage-aware acceleration framework for Visual Autoregressive models that selectively prunes/approximates late-stage computations while preserving early critical steps, achieving 3.4x speedup with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR models suffer from high computational complexity at large-scale steps, and existing acceleration methods rely on manual step selection while ignoring varying importance of different generation stages.

Method: Stage-aware acceleration framework that analyzes generation stages, preserves early critical steps for semantic/structure consistency, and exploits semantic irrelevance and low-rank properties in late-stage computations for pruning/approximation without additional training.

Result: Achieves up to 3.4x speedup with only 0.01 drop on GenEval and 0.26 decrease on DPG, consistently outperforming existing acceleration baselines.

Conclusion: Stage-aware design is a powerful principle for efficient visual autoregressive image generation, demonstrating that different generation stages have varying importance that can be exploited for acceleration.

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive (VAR) modeling departs from the next-token prediction paradigm of traditional Autoregressive (AR) models through next-scale prediction, enabling high-quality image generation. However, the VAR paradigm suffers from sharply increased computational complexity and running time at large-scale steps. Although existing acceleration methods reduce runtime for large-scale steps, but rely on manual step selection and overlook the varying importance of different stages in the generation process. To address this challenge, we present StageVAR, a systematic study and stage-aware acceleration framework for VAR models. Our analysis shows that early steps are critical for preserving semantic and structural consistency and should remain intact, while later steps mainly refine details and can be pruned or approximated for acceleration. Building on these insights, StageVAR introduces a plug-and-play acceleration strategy that exploits semantic irrelevance and low-rank properties in late-stage computations, without requiring additional training. Our proposed StageVAR achieves up to 3.4x speedup with only a 0.01 drop on GenEval and a 0.26 decrease on DPG, consistently outperforming existing acceleration baselines. These results highlight stage-aware design as a powerful principle for efficient visual autoregressive image generation.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach for blind image quality assessment that mimics human perception-reasoning cascades, achieving competitive performance while improving interpretability through self-consistent reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans assess image quality through perception-reasoning cascades that integrate sensory cues with implicit reasoning. Current BIQA models lack human-like reasoning capabilities and interpretability, motivating the development of models that can acquire both human-like and self-consistent reasoning for quality assessment.

Method: 1) Collect human evaluation data capturing perception-reasoning aspects; 2) Use reinforcement learning with human annotations as reward signals to guide human-like perception and reasoning; 3) Design additional reward to enable self-consistent reasoning where models infer quality from self-generated descriptions.

Result: Achieves score prediction performance comparable to state-of-the-art BIQA systems on Pearson and Spearman correlation metrics. Additionally, achieves ROUGE-1 score of 0.512 (vs. 0.443 baseline) on over 1,000 human-annotated samples, showing substantial coverage of human explanations and improved interpretability.

Conclusion: The approach successfully develops models with human-like perception-reasoning capabilities for BIQA, demonstrating both competitive performance and improved interpretability through self-consistent reasoning, marking progress toward more human-like and explainable quality assessment systems.

Abstract: Humans assess image quality through a perception-reasoning cascade, integrating sensory cues with implicit reasoning to form self-consistent judgments. In this work, we investigate how a model can acquire both human-like and self-consistent reasoning capability for blind image quality assessment (BIQA). We first collect human evaluation data that capture several aspects of human perception-reasoning pipeline. Then, we adopt reinforcement learning, using human annotations as reward signals to guide the model toward human-like perception and reasoning. To enable the model to internalize self-consistent reasoning capability, we design a reward that drives the model to infer the image quality purely from self-generated descriptions. Empirically, our approach achieves score prediction performance comparable to state-of-the-art BIQA systems under general metrics, including Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients. In addition to the rating score, we assess human-model alignment using ROUGE-1 to measure the similarity between model-generated and human perception-reasoning chains. On over 1,000 human-annotated samples, our model reaches a ROUGE-1 score of 0.512 (cf. 0.443 for baseline), indicating substantial coverage of human explanations and marking a step toward human-like interpretable reasoning in BIQA.

Method: Created EMER dataset using spontaneous emotion induction with eye movement sequences, fixation maps, and facial videos. Developed EMERT model with modality-adversarial feature decoupling and multitask Transformer to integrate eye behaviors with facial expressions.

Result: EMERT outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal methods by a great margin, demonstrating the importance of eye behaviors for robust emotion recognition. Seven benchmark protocols show comprehensive evaluation capabilities.

Conclusion: Eye behaviors are crucial for bridging the gap between FER and ER, leading to more robust emotion recognition. The EMER dataset and EMERT models provide valuable resources for advancing emotion recognition research.

Abstract: Emotion Recognition (ER) is the process of analyzing and identifying human emotions from sensing data. Currently, the field heavily relies on facial expression recognition (FER) because visual channel conveys rich emotional cues. However, facial expressions are often used as social tools rather than manifestations of genuine inner emotions. To understand and bridge this gap between FER and ER, we introduce eye behaviors as an important emotional cue and construct an Eye-behavior-aided Multimodal Emotion Recognition (EMER) dataset. To collect data with genuine emotions, spontaneous emotion induction paradigm is exploited with stimulus material, during which non-invasive eye behavior data, like eye movement sequences and eye fixation maps, is captured together with facial expression videos. To better illustrate the gap between ER and FER, multi-view emotion labels for mutimodal ER and FER are separately annotated. Furthermore, based on the new dataset, we design a simple yet effective Eye-behavior-aided MER Transformer (EMERT) that enhances ER by bridging the emotion gap. EMERT leverages modality-adversarial feature decoupling and a multitask Transformer to model eye behaviors as a strong complement to facial expressions. In the experiment, we introduce seven multimodal benchmark protocols for a variety of comprehensive evaluations of the EMER dataset. The results show that the EMERT outperforms other state-of-the-art multimodal methods by a great margin, revealing the importance of modeling eye behaviors for robust ER. To sum up, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the importance of eye behaviors in ER, advancing the study on addressing the gap between FER and ER for more robust ER performance. Our EMER dataset and the trained EMERT models will be publicly available at https://github.com/kejun1/EMER.

### [59] [YOLO11-4K: An Efficient Architecture for Real-Time Small Object Detection in 4K Panoramic Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16493)
*Huma Hafeez,Matthew Garratt,Jo Plested,Sankaran Iyer,Arcot Sowmya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOLO11-4K is an efficient real-time object detection framework optimized for 4K panoramic images, achieving 0.95 mAP with 75% latency reduction compared to YOLO11.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Omnidirectional 360-degree images present challenges for object detection due to spatial distortions, wide fields of view, and ultra-high-resolution inputs. Conventional detectors like YOLO struggle with computational demands of 4K+ resolution imagery typical in 360-degree vision.

Method: Introduces YOLO11-4K with novel multi-scale detection head featuring P2 layer for small object sensitivity, and GhostConv-based backbone to reduce computational complexity while maintaining representational power. Also created CVIP360 dataset with 6,876 frame-level bounding boxes for evaluation.

Result: Achieves 0.95 mAP at 0.50 IoU with 28.3ms inference per frame, representing 75% latency reduction compared to YOLO11 (112.3ms) while improving accuracy (0.95 vs 0.908 mAP).

Conclusion: YOLO11-4K balances efficiency and precision for robust object detection in expansive 360-degree environments, making it suitable for real-world high-resolution panoramic applications in autonomous navigation, surveillance, and augmented reality.

Abstract: The processing of omnidirectional 360-degree images poses significant challenges for object detection due to inherent spatial distortions, wide fields of view, and ultra-high-resolution inputs. Conventional detectors such as YOLO are optimised for standard image sizes (for example, 640x640 pixels) and often struggle with the computational demands of 4K or higher-resolution imagery typical of 360-degree vision. To address these limitations, we introduce YOLO11-4K, an efficient real-time detection framework tailored for 4K panoramic images. The architecture incorporates a novel multi-scale detection head with a P2 layer to improve sensitivity to small objects often missed at coarser scales, and a GhostConv-based backbone to reduce computational complexity without sacrificing representational power. To enable evaluation, we manually annotated the CVIP360 dataset, generating 6,876 frame-level bounding boxes and producing a publicly available, detection-ready benchmark for 4K panoramic scenes. YOLO11-4K achieves 0.95 mAP at 0.50 IoU with 28.3 milliseconds inference per frame, representing a 75 percent latency reduction compared to YOLO11 (112.3 milliseconds), while also improving accuracy (mAP at 0.50 of 0.95 versus 0.908). This balance of efficiency and precision enables robust object detection in expansive 360-degree environments, making the framework suitable for real-world high-resolution panoramic applications. While this work focuses on 4K omnidirectional images, the approach is broadly applicable to high-resolution detection tasks in autonomous navigation, surveillance, and augmented reality.

*Mengyuan Liu,Jiajie Liu,Jinyan Zhang,Wenhao Li,Junsong Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoseMoE: Mixture-of-Experts network for monocular 3D human pose estimation that disentangles 2D pose and depth feature encoding to address depth uncertainty issues in lifting-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lifting-based methods for 3D human pose estimation encode detected 2D poses and unknown depth in entangled feature space, which introduces depth uncertainty to 2D pose features and limits overall accuracy. The paper reveals that depth representation is pivotal - joint encoding is detrimental when depth is completely unknown but beneficial when depth is initially refined.

Method: Proposes PoseMoE with: (1) Mixture-of-experts network where specialized expert modules separately refine well-detected 2D pose features and learn depth features, disentangling their encoding to reduce uncertain depth influence on 2D pose. (2) Cross-expert knowledge aggregation module to aggregate spatio-temporal contextual information through bidirectional mapping between 2D pose and depth.

Result: Extensive experiments show PoseMoE outperforms conventional lifting-based methods on three widely used datasets: Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW.

Conclusion: The proposed PoseMoE effectively addresses the depth uncertainty problem in lifting-based 3D human pose estimation by disentangling 2D pose and depth feature encoding through a mixture-of-experts approach, leading to improved performance across standard benchmarks.

Abstract: The lifting-based methods have dominated monocular 3D human pose estimation by leveraging detected 2D poses as intermediate representations. The 2D component of the final 3D human pose benefits from the detected 2D poses, whereas its depth counterpart must be estimated from scratch. The lifting-based methods encode the detected 2D pose and unknown depth in an entangled feature space, explicitly introducing depth uncertainty to the detected 2D pose, thereby limiting overall estimation accuracy. This work reveals that the depth representation is pivotal for the estimation process. Specifically, when depth is in an initial, completely unknown state, jointly encoding depth features with 2D pose features is detrimental to the estimation process. In contrast, when depth is initially refined to a more dependable state via network-based estimation, encoding it together with 2D pose information is beneficial. To address this limitation, we present a Mixture-of-Experts network for monocular 3D pose estimation named PoseMoE. Our approach introduces: (1) A mixture-of-experts network where specialized expert modules refine the well-detected 2D pose features and learn the depth features. This mixture-of-experts design disentangles the feature encoding process for 2D pose and depth, therefore reducing the explicit influence of uncertain depth features on 2D pose features. (2) A cross-expert knowledge aggregation module is proposed to aggregate cross-expert spatio-temporal contextual information. This step enhances features through bidirectional mapping between 2D pose and depth. Extensive experiments show that our proposed PoseMoE outperforms the conventional lifting-based methods on three widely used datasets: Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW.

TL;DR: VenusBench-GD is a comprehensive bilingual benchmark for GUI grounding across multiple platforms with hierarchical evaluation, showing general multimodal models match specialized GUI models on basic tasks but advanced tasks still favor specialized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI grounding benchmarks have limitations: insufficient data volume, narrow domain coverage, single-platform focus, or require specialized domain knowledge, creating a need for more comprehensive evaluation frameworks.

Method: Created VenusBench-GD benchmark with: (1) large-scale cross-platform coverage of applications, UI elements, and rich annotations; (2) high-quality data construction pipeline with better annotation accuracy; (3) hierarchical task taxonomy dividing grounding into basic and advanced categories with six subtasks.

Result: General-purpose multimodal models now match or surpass specialized GUI models on basic grounding tasks, while advanced tasks still favor GUI-specialized models, though they show significant overfitting and poor robustness.

Conclusion: Comprehensive, multi-tiered evaluation frameworks are necessary for GUI grounding, as current specialized models overfit and lack robustness, while general models are catching up on basic tasks.

Abstract: GUI grounding is a critical component in building capable GUI agents. However, existing grounding benchmarks suffer from significant limitations: they either provide insufficient data volume and narrow domain coverage, or focus excessively on a single platform and require highly specialized domain knowledge. In this work, we present VenusBench-GD, a comprehensive, bilingual benchmark for GUI grounding that spans multiple platforms, enabling hierarchical evaluation for real-word applications. VenusBench-GD contributes as follows: (i) we introduce a large-scale, cross-platform benchmark with extensive coverage of applications, diverse UI elements, and rich annotated data, (ii) we establish a high-quality data construction pipeline for grounding tasks, achieving higher annotation accuracy than existing benchmarks, and (iii) we extend the scope of element grounding by proposing a hierarchical task taxonomy that divides grounding into basic and advanced categories, encompassing six distinct subtasks designed to evaluate models from complementary perspectives. Our experimental findings reveal critical insights: general-purpose multimodal models now match or even surpass specialized GUI models on basic grounding tasks. In contrast, advanced tasks, still favor GUI-specialized models, though they exhibit significant overfitting and poor robustness. These results underscore the necessity of comprehensive, multi-tiered evaluation frameworks.

*Qiushuo Cheng,Jingjing Liu,Catherine Morgan,Alan Whone,Majid Mirmehdi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised pretraining with snippet discrimination and U-shaped feature fusion improves skeleton-based temporal action localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised methods work well for skeleton-based action recognition but struggle with temporal action localization, which requires more temporally sensitive features to detect subtle boundary changes between adjacent frames.

Method: 1) Snippet discrimination pretext task: densely projects skeleton sequences into non-overlapping segments and uses contrastive learning to distinguish them across videos. 2) U-shaped module: fuses intermediate features from strong backbones to enhance feature resolution for frame-level localization.

Result: Consistently improves existing skeleton-based contrastive learning methods for action localization on BABEL across diverse subsets and evaluation protocols. Achieves state-of-the-art transfer learning performance on PKUMMD with pretraining on NTU RGB+D and BABEL.

Conclusion: The proposed snippet discrimination pretext task and U-shaped feature fusion effectively address the challenges of temporal action localization by providing temporally sensitive features and enhanced resolution for boundary detection.

Abstract: The self-supervised pretraining paradigm has achieved great success in learning 3D action representations for skeleton-based action recognition using contrastive learning. However, learning effective representations for skeleton-based temporal action localization remains challenging and underexplored. Unlike video-level {action} recognition, detecting action boundaries requires temporally sensitive features that capture subtle differences between adjacent frames where labels change. To this end, we formulate a snippet discrimination pretext task for self-supervised pretraining, which densely projects skeleton sequences into non-overlapping segments and promotes features that distinguish them across videos via contrastive learning. Additionally, we build on strong backbones of skeleton-based action recognition models by fusing intermediate features with a U-shaped module to enhance feature resolution for frame-level localization. Our approach consistently improves existing skeleton-based contrastive learning methods for action localization on BABEL across diverse subsets and evaluation protocols. We also achieve state-of-the-art transfer learning performance on PKUMMD with pretraining on NTU RGB+D and BABEL.

*Hossein Javidnia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAGINet is a multi-scale attention-guided network for high-quality intrinsic decomposition of face images, producing six physically-based rendering passes for photorealistic relighting and material editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate intrinsic decomposition of face images under unconstrained lighting is essential for photorealistic relighting, digital doubles, and AR effects, but existing methods lack fidelity.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) MAGINet predicts 512×512 diffuse albedo using hierarchical residual encoding, spatial-channel attention, and multi-scale fusion; 2) RefinementNet upsamples to 1024×1024; 3) Pix2PixHD-based translator generates five additional rendering passes conditioned on refined albedo.

Result: State-of-the-art performance for diffuse albedo estimation and significantly improved fidelity for complete rendering stack compared to prior methods, enabling high-quality relighting and material editing.

Conclusion: MAGINet provides a comprehensive solution for intrinsic face decomposition with six physically-based passes, advancing the state-of-the-art for photorealistic face relighting and editing applications.

Abstract: Accurate intrinsic decomposition of face images under unconstrained lighting is a prerequisite for photorealistic relighting, high-fidelity digital doubles, and augmented-reality effects. This paper introduces MAGINet, a Multi-scale Attention-Guided Intrinsics Network that predicts a $512\times512$ light-normalized diffuse albedo map from a single RGB portrait. MAGINet employs hierarchical residual encoding, spatial-and-channel attention in a bottleneck, and adaptive multi-scale feature fusion in the decoder, yielding sharper albedo boundaries and stronger lighting invariance than prior U-Net variants. The initial albedo prediction is upsampled to $1024\times1024$ and refined by a lightweight three-layer CNN (RefinementNet). Conditioned on this refined albedo, a Pix2PixHD-based translator then predicts a comprehensive set of five additional physically based rendering passes: ambient occlusion, surface normal, specular reflectance, translucency, and raw diffuse colour (with residual lighting). Together with the refined albedo, these six passes form the complete intrinsic decomposition. Trained with a combination of masked-MSE, VGG, edge, and patch-LPIPS losses on the FFHQ-UV-Intrinsics dataset, the full pipeline achieves state-of-the-art performance for diffuse albedo estimation and demonstrates significantly improved fidelity for the complete rendering stack compared to prior methods. The resulting passes enable high-quality relighting and material editing of real faces.

*Zhiwei Li,Yitian Pang,Weining Wang,Zhenan Sun,Qi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TTP is a lightweight test-time defense framework for CLIP models that detects adversarial inputs via cosine similarity shift after spatial padding, then uses trainable padding and similarity-aware ensemble to restore robustness without compromising clean accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models like CLIP are vulnerable to adversarial attacks but existing defenses are either costly (requiring labeled data and retraining) or unreliable at distinguishing clean vs adversarial inputs at test time.

Method: Test-Time Padding (TTP) framework with two main components: 1) adversarial detection using cosine similarity shift between original and padded CLIP feature embeddings, and 2) targeted adaptation using trainable padding to restore attention patterns and similarity-aware ensemble for robust predictions.

Result: TTP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art test-time defenses across diverse CLIP backbones and fine-grained benchmarks, delivering substantial improvements in adversarial robustness while maintaining clean accuracy.

Conclusion: TTP provides an effective, lightweight test-time defense solution for CLIP models that addresses the limitations of existing approaches by reliably detecting adversarial inputs and adapting only when necessary, achieving optimal balance between robustness and accuracy.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have achieved impressive zero-shot recognition performance but remain highly susceptible to adversarial perturbations, posing significant risks in safety-critical scenarios. Previous training-time defenses rely on adversarial fine-tuning, which requires labeled data and costly retraining, while existing test-time strategies fail to reliably distinguish between clean and adversarial inputs, thereby preventing both adversarial robustness and clean accuracy from reaching their optimum. To address these limitations, we propose Test-Time Padding (TTP), a lightweight defense framework that performs adversarial detection followed by targeted adaptation at inference. TTP identifies adversarial inputs via the cosine similarity shift between CLIP feature embeddings computed before and after spatial padding, yielding a universal threshold for reliable detection across architectures and datasets. For detected adversarial cases, TTP employs trainable padding to restore disrupted attention patterns, coupled with a similarity-aware ensemble strategy for a more robust final prediction. For clean inputs, TTP leaves them unchanged by default or optionally integrates existing test-time adaptation techniques for further accuracy gains. Comprehensive experiments on diverse CLIP backbones and fine-grained benchmarks show that TTP consistently surpasses state-of-the-art test-time defenses, delivering substantial improvements in adversarial robustness without compromising clean accuracy. The code for this paper will be released soon.

TL;DR: N3D-VLM is a unified framework that integrates native 3D object perception with 3D-aware visual reasoning, enabling precise 3D grounding and interpretable spatial understanding beyond conventional 2D image-based multimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal models lack intrinsic 3D object perception, limiting their ability to comprehend spatial relationships and depth cues in 3D scenes. They can only answer questions based on 2D images without true 3D understanding.

Method: Proposes N3D-VLM framework with native 3D object perception that directly localizes objects in 3D space based on textual descriptions. Uses scalable data construction pipeline leveraging depth estimation to lift large-scale 2D annotations into 3D space, generating spatial QA datasets for chain-of-thought reasoning in 3D.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D grounding tasks and consistently surpasses existing methods in 3D spatial reasoning in vision-language models. Creates dataset over six times larger than the largest existing single-image 3D detection dataset.

Conclusion: The unified framework successfully integrates native 3D object perception with 3D-aware visual reasoning, enabling both precise 3D grounding and interpretable spatial understanding, advancing multimodal models beyond 2D perception limitations.

Abstract: While current multimodal models can answer questions based on 2D images, they lack intrinsic 3D object perception, limiting their ability to comprehend spatial relationships and depth cues in 3D scenes. In this work, we propose N3D-VLM, a novel unified framework that seamlessly integrates native 3D object perception with 3D-aware visual reasoning, enabling both precise 3D grounding and interpretable spatial understanding. Unlike conventional end-to-end models that directly predict answers from RGB/RGB-D inputs, our approach equips the model with native 3D object perception capabilities, enabling it to directly localize objects in 3D space based on textual descriptions. Building upon accurate 3D object localization, the model further performs explicit reasoning in 3D, achieving more interpretable and structured spatial understanding. To support robust training for these capabilities, we develop a scalable data construction pipeline that leverages depth estimation to lift large-scale 2D annotations into 3D space, significantly increasing the diversity and coverage for 3D object grounding data, yielding over six times larger than the largest existing single-image 3D detection dataset. Moreover, the pipeline generates spatial question-answering datasets that target chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in 3D, facilitating joint training for both 3D object localization and 3D spatial reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified framework not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D grounding tasks, but also consistently surpasses existing methods in 3D spatial reasoning in vision-language model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create persistent 4D reconstructions that capture not only visible scene parts but also previously viewed elements, enabling complete temporal replay and object permanence

Method: Decomposes scene into rigid 3D primitives, uses dense 2D correspondences to jointly infer rigid motion through optimization, with motion extrapolation for invisible objects using motion-grouping techniques

Result: Significantly outperforms existing methods on object scanning and multi-object datasets both quantitatively and qualitatively, enabling 4D spatio-temporal awareness with replayable 3D reconstructions

Conclusion: The system successfully achieves complete and persistent 4D reconstruction from casual monocular videos, providing object permanence and enabling novel applications like replayable articulated object reconstructions

Abstract: We present a dynamic reconstruction system that receives a casual monocular RGB video as input, and outputs a complete and persistent reconstruction of the scene. In other words, we reconstruct not only the the currently visible parts of the scene, but also all previously viewed parts, which enables replaying the complete reconstruction across all timesteps.
  Our method decomposes the scene into a set of rigid 3D primitives, which are assumed to be moving throughout the scene. Using estimated dense 2D correspondences, we jointly infer the rigid motion of these primitives through an optimisation pipeline, yielding a 4D reconstruction of the scene, i.e. providing 3D geometry dynamically moving through time. To achieve this, we also introduce a mechanism to extrapolate motion for objects that become invisible, employing motion-grouping techniques to maintain continuity.
  The resulting system enables 4D spatio-temporal awareness, offering capabilities such as replayable 3D reconstructions of articulated objects through time, multi-object scanning, and object permanence. On object scanning and multi-object datasets, our system significantly outperforms existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chest X-ray pneumonia diagnosis typically requires costly pixel-level annotations for accurate localization. There's a need for methods that can localize pneumonia regions using only image-level labels to reduce annotation burden.

Method: Proposed weakly supervised framework using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) with image-level labels only. Evaluated seven pre-trained models (including Vision Transformer) under identical conditions with focal loss and patient-wise splits to prevent data leakage.

Result: All models achieved high classification accuracy (96-98%). ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B0 showed best overall performance, while MobileNet-V3 provided efficient lightweight alternative. Grad-CAM heatmaps successfully highlighted clinically relevant lung regions.

Conclusion: Weakly supervised explainable AI models can effectively localize pneumonia regions without pixel-level annotations, enhancing transparency and clinical trust in AI-assisted pneumonia screening.

Abstract: Chest X-ray imaging is commonly used to diagnose pneumonia, but accurately localizing the pneumonia-affected regions typically requires detailed pixel-level annotations, which are costly and time consuming to obtain. To address this limitation, this study proposes a weakly supervised deep learning framework for pneumonia classification and localization using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). Instead of relying on costly pixel-level annotations, the proposed method utilizes image-level labels to generate clinically meaningful heatmaps that highlight pneumonia-affected regions. Furthermore, we evaluate seven pre-trained deep learning models, including a Vision Transformer, under identical training conditions, using focal loss and patient-wise splits to prevent data leakage. Experimental results suggest that all models achieved high classification accuracy (96--98\%), with ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B0 showing the best overall performance and MobileNet-V3 providing an efficient lightweight alternative. Grad-CAM heatmap visualizations confirm that the proposed methods focus on clinically relevant lung regions, supporting the use of explainable AI for radiological diagnostics. Overall, this work highlights the potential of weakly supervised, explainable models that enhance transparency and clinical trust in AI-assisted pneumonia screening.

*Yin Zhang,Yongqiang Zhang,Yaoyue Zheng,Bogdan Raducanu,Dan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Causal-Tune: A novel fine-tuning method that identifies and disentangles causal vs. non-causal factors in Vision Foundation Models for better domain generalization in semantic segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-tuning methods for Vision Foundation Models overlook artifacts from long-term pre-training that hinder domain generalization. These artifacts are associated with non-causal factors residing in frequency components, degrading performance on unseen domains.

Method: Proposes Causal-Tune: 1) Extract frequency spectrum of features using DCT, 2) Apply Gaussian band-pass filter to separate causal/non-causal components, 3) Introduce causal-aware learnable tokens to refine causal components in frequency domain, 4) Discard non-causal components, 5) Transform refined features back to spatial domain via inverse DCT.

Result: Achieves superior performance on various cross-domain tasks, particularly under adverse weather conditions. Improves +4.8% mIoU over baseline in snow conditions.

Conclusion: Causal-Tune effectively identifies and disentangles causal factors from non-causal artifacts in VFMs, enabling more robust domain generalization in semantic segmentation through frequency-domain analysis and refinement.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) with a small number of parameters has shown remarkable performance in Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS). Most existing works either train lightweight adapters or refine intermediate features to achieve better generalization on unseen domains. However, they both overlook the fact that long-term pre-trained VFMs often exhibit artifacts, which hinder the utilization of valuable representations and ultimately degrade DGSS performance. Inspired by causal mechanisms, we observe that these artifacts are associated with non-causal factors, which usually reside in the low- and high-frequency components of the VFM spectrum. In this paper, we explicitly examine the causal and non-causal factors of features within VFMs for DGSS, and propose a simple yet effective method to identify and disentangle them, enabling more robust domain generalization. Specifically, we propose Causal-Tune, a novel fine-tuning strategy designed to extract causal factors and suppress non-causal ones from the features of VFMs. First, we extract the frequency spectrum of features from each layer using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). A Gaussian band-pass filter is then applied to separate the spectrum into causal and non-causal components. To further refine the causal components, we introduce a set of causal-aware learnable tokens that operate in the frequency domain, while the non-causal components are discarded. Finally, refined features are transformed back into the spatial domain via inverse DCT and passed to the next layer. Extensive experiments conducted on various cross-domain tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of Causal-Tune. In particular, our method achieves superior performance under adverse weather conditions, improving +4.8% mIoU over the baseline in snow conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for 3D medical scan forecasting have limitations: they rely on single prior scans, fixed grid times, or target global labels, which restricts voxel-level forecasting under irregular sampling patterns common in medical imaging.

Method: CRONOS learns a spatio-temporal velocity field that transports context volumes toward a target volume at arbitrary future times. It operates directly in 3D voxel space and supports both discrete (grid-based) and continuous (real-valued) timestamps in a single unified model.

Result: CRONOS outperforms other baselines across three public datasets spanning Cine-MRI, perfusion CT, and longitudinal MRI, while remaining computationally competitive.

Conclusion: CRONOS represents the first continuous sequence-to-image forecasting framework for 3D medical data, enabling more flexible and accurate disease progression modeling with irregular sampling patterns.

Abstract: Forecasting how 3D medical scans evolve over time is important for disease progression, treatment planning, and developmental assessment. Yet existing models either rely on a single prior scan, fixed grid times, or target global labels, which limits voxel-level forecasting under irregular sampling. We present CRONOS, a unified framework for many-to-one prediction from multiple past scans that supports both discrete (grid-based) and continuous (real-valued) timestamps in one model, to the best of our knowledge the first to achieve continuous sequence-to-image forecasting for 3D medical data. CRONOS learns a spatio-temporal velocity field that transports context volumes toward a target volume at an arbitrary time, while operating directly in 3D voxel space. Across three public datasets spanning Cine-MRI, perfusion CT, and longitudinal MRI, CRONOS outperforms other baselines, while remaining computationally competitive. We will release code and evaluation protocols to enable reproducible, multi-dataset benchmarking of multi-context, continuous-time forecasting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SkiLa enables MLLMs to generate visual embeddings as "latent sketch tokens" during reasoning, allowing unified visual-text thinking without external tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack visual imagination capabilities during reasoning. Unlike humans who can form flexible visual-text interactions in a unified mental space, MLLMs rely on predefined toolkits or separate image generation. Since MLLMs already encode visual and text information in the same feature space, visual tokens should be seamlessly integrated into reasoning processes.

Method: Proposes Sketch-in-Latents (SkiLa) paradigm that expands MLLMs' auto-regressive capabilities to generate continuous visual embeddings called "latent sketch tokens" as visual thoughts. The model dynamically alternates between textual thinking mode (generating text tokens) and visual sketching mode (generating latent sketch tokens). Includes a latent visual semantics reconstruction mechanism to ensure semantic grounding of visual tokens.

Result: Extensive experiments show SkiLa achieves superior performance on vision-centric tasks while exhibiting strong generalization to diverse general multi-modal benchmarks.

Conclusion: SkiLa enables unified multi-modal reasoning by allowing MLLMs to natively generate visual embeddings during reasoning, mimicking human-like visual-text imagination without predefined toolkits.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual understanding tasks through text reasoning, they often fall short in scenarios requiring visual imagination. Unlike current works that take predefined external toolkits or generate images during thinking, however, humans can form flexible visual-text imagination and interactions during thinking without predefined toolkits, where one important reason is that humans construct the visual-text thinking process in a unified space inside the brain. Inspired by this capability, given that current MLLMs already encode visual and text information in the same feature space, we hold that visual tokens can be seamlessly inserted into the reasoning process carried by text tokens, where ideally, all visual imagination processes can be encoded by the latent features. To achieve this goal, we propose Sketch-in-Latents (SkiLa), a novel paradigm for unified multi-modal reasoning that expands the auto-regressive capabilities of MLLMs to natively generate continuous visual embeddings, termed latent sketch tokens, as visual thoughts. During multi-step reasoning, the model dynamically alternates between textual thinking mode for generating textual think tokens and visual sketching mode for generating latent sketch tokens. A latent visual semantics reconstruction mechanism is proposed to ensure these latent sketch tokens are semantically grounded. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SkiLa achieves superior performance on vision-centric tasks while exhibiting strong generalization to diverse general multi-modal benchmarks. Codes will be released at https://github.com/TungChintao/SkiLa.

*Shaohua Wu,Tong Yu,Shenling Wang,Xudong Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Yuan-TecSwin: A text-conditioned diffusion model using Swin-transformer instead of CNN blocks to improve long-range semantic understanding, achieving state-of-the-art FID of 1.37 on ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN-based diffusion models have locality limitations that restrict their ability to understand long-range semantic information in images, which affects text-image alignment and overall generation quality.

Method: Replace CNN blocks with Swin-transformer blocks in encoder/decoder for better non-local modeling; improve text-image alignment through better text encoder, text embedding utilization, and text condition incorporation; use adapted time step search across diffusion stages.

Result: Achieves SOTA FID score of 1.37 on ImageNet generation benchmark; 10% inference performance improvement via time step adaptation; human evaluators struggle to distinguish generated images from human-painted ones.

Conclusion: Transformer-based architecture (Swin-transformer) effectively addresses CNN's locality limitations in diffusion models, enabling superior long-range semantic understanding and text-image alignment for high-quality image generation.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable capacity in image synthesis based on their U-shaped architecture and convolutional neural networks (CNN) as basic blocks. The locality of the convolution operation in CNN may limit the model's ability to understand long-range semantic information. To address this issue, we propose Yuan-TecSwin, a text-conditioned diffusion model with Swin-transformer in this work. The Swin-transformer blocks take the place of CNN blocks in the encoder and decoder, to improve the non-local modeling ability in feature extraction and image restoration. The text-image alignment is improved with a well-chosen text encoder, effective utilization of text embedding, and careful design in the incorporation of text condition. Using an adapted time step to search in different diffusion stages, inference performance is further improved by 10%. Yuan-TecSwin achieves the state-of-the-art FID score of 1.37 on ImageNet generation benchmark, without any additional models at different denoising stages. In a side-by-side comparison, we find it difficult for human interviewees to tell the model-generated images from the human-painted ones.

*Yifan Zhou,Zeqi Xiao,Tianyi Wei,Shuai Yang,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLSA is a hierarchical sparse attention mechanism for Diffusion Transformers that reduces quadratic attention costs to log-linear complexity, enabling efficient training on long token sequences for high-resolution image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DiTs suffer from quadratic self-attention costs that limit scaling to long token sequences. Existing sparse attention methods still have quadratic selection costs and require increasing K values as sequences grow, making them inefficient for extremely long sequences.

Method: LLSA uses hierarchical Top-K selection that progressively applies sparse selection with indices from previous levels, plus Hierarchical KV Enrichment to preserve global context with fewer tokens. Includes high-performance GPU implementation using only sparse indices without dense masks.

Result: LLSA accelerates attention inference by 28.27x and DiT training by 6.09x on 256x256 pixel token sequences while maintaining generation quality. Enables high-resolution pixel-space image generation without patchification or VAE encoding.

Conclusion: LLSA provides an efficient trainable sparse attention mechanism for extremely long token sequences, offering a promising direction for scaling Diffusion Transformers to high-resolution generation tasks with log-linear complexity.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) set the state of the art in visual generation, yet their quadratic self-attention cost fundamentally limits scaling to long token sequences. Recent Top-K sparse attention approaches reduce the computation of DiTs by compressing tokens into block-wise representation and selecting a small set of relevant key blocks, but still suffer from (i) quadratic selection cost on compressed tokens and (ii) increasing K required to maintain model quality as sequences grow. We identify that their inefficiency is due to the single-level design, as a single coarse level is insufficient to represent the global structure. In this paper, we introduce Log-linear Sparse Attention (LLSA), a trainable sparse attention mechanism for extremely long token sequences that reduces both selection and attention costs from quadratic to log-linear complexity by utilizing a hierarchical structure. LLSA performs hierarchical Top-K selection, progressively adopting sparse Top-K selection with the indices found at the previous level, and introduces a Hierarchical KV Enrichment mechanism that preserves global context while using fewer tokens of different granularity during attention computation. To support efficient training, we develop a high-performance GPU implementation that uses only sparse indices for both the forward and backward passes, eliminating the need for dense attention masks. We evaluate LLSA on high-resolution pixel-space image generation without using patchification and VAE encoding. LLSA accelerates attention inference by 28.27x and DiT training by 6.09x on 256x256 pixel token sequences, while maintaining generation quality. The results demonstrate that LLSA offers a promising direction for training long-sequence DiTs efficiently. Code is available at: https://github.com/SingleZombie/LLSA

*Kanwal Aftab,Graham Adams,Mark Scanlon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning pipeline uses electric sockets as indoor markers for forensic geolocation, achieving high accuracy in detection, classification, and country mapping to combat crimes like human trafficking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Indoor multimedia geolocation is underdeveloped but crucial for fighting serious crimes like human trafficking and child exploitation. While outdoor geolocation is well-explored, indoor geolocation faces challenges including similar room layouts, unreliable GPS, visual ambiguity, and limited datasets in sensitive domains.

Method: Three-stage deep learning pipeline: 1) YOLOv11 for plug socket detection (mAP@0.5 = 0.843), 2) Xception for classifying sockets into 12 types (accuracy = 0.912), 3) mapping detected socket types to countries (accuracy = 0.96 at >90% threshold). Created two datasets to address scarcity: socket detection dataset (2,328→4,072 images) and classification dataset (3,187 images across 12 classes).

Result: Pipeline achieved high accuracy across all stages and was evaluated on the Hotels-50K dataset (TraffickCam subset) which captures real-world conditions like poor lighting and amateur angles. The framework demonstrates practical applicability for digital forensics.

Conclusion: Using electric sockets as consistent indoor markers provides a practical approach to indoor geolocation for forensic applications. The open-source release of code, models, and data supports further development in this crucial domain for law enforcement.

Abstract: Computer vision is a rapidly evolving field, giving rise to powerful new tools and techniques in digital forensic investigation, and shows great promise for novel digital forensic applications. One such application, indoor multimedia geolocation, has the potential to become a crucial aid for law enforcement in the fight against human trafficking, child exploitation, and other serious crimes. While outdoor multimedia geolocation has been widely explored, its indoor counterpart remains underdeveloped due to challenges such as similar room layouts, frequent renovations, visual ambiguity, indoor lighting variability, unreliable GPS signals, and limited datasets in sensitive domains. This paper introduces a pipeline that uses electric sockets as consistent indoor markers for geolocation, since plug socket types are standardised by country or region. The three-stage deep learning pipeline detects plug sockets (YOLOv11, mAP@0.5 = 0.843), classifies them into one of 12 plug socket types (Xception, accuracy = 0.912), and maps the detected socket types to countries (accuracy = 0.96 at >90% threshold confidence). To address data scarcity, two dedicated datasets were created: socket detection dataset of 2,328 annotated images expanded to 4,072 through augmentation, and a classification dataset of 3,187 images across 12 plug socket classes. The pipeline was evaluated on the Hotels-50K dataset, focusing on the TraffickCam subset of crowd-sourced hotel images, which capture real-world conditions such as poor lighting and amateur angles. This dataset provides a more realistic evaluation than using professional, well-lit, often wide-angle images from travel websites. This framework demonstrates a practical step toward real-world digital forensic applications. The code, trained models, and the data for this paper are available open source.

### [75] [DeContext as Defense: Safe Image Editing in Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16625)
*Linghui Shen,Mingyue Cui,Xingyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeContext is a defense method that uses targeted perturbations to block unauthorized in-context image editing by weakening cross-attention pathways in diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In-context diffusion models enable powerful image manipulation but raise serious privacy concerns, as personal images can be easily modified for identity impersonation, misinformation, or malicious use without consent. Existing defenses for personalized text-to-image generation haven't been tested on modern large-scale DiT-based models.

Method: DeContext injects small, targeted perturbations to weaken cross-attention pathways in multimodal attention layers, which are identified as the primary mechanism for contextual information propagation from source images to outputs. The method focuses perturbations on early denoising steps and specific transformer blocks where context propagation is most dominant.

Result: Experiments on Flux Kontext and Step1X-Edit show DeContext consistently blocks unwanted image edits while preserving visual quality, demonstrating the effectiveness of attention-based perturbations as a defense against image manipulation.

Conclusion: Attention-based perturbations provide an efficient and robust defense mechanism against unauthorized in-context image editing, effectively decoupling the link between input and output by targeting the cross-attention pathways that propagate contextual information.

Abstract: In-context diffusion models allow users to modify images with remarkable ease and realism. However, the same power raises serious privacy concerns: personal images can be easily manipulated for identity impersonation, misinformation, or other malicious uses, all without the owner's consent. While prior work has explored input perturbations to protect against misuse in personalized text-to-image generation, the robustness of modern, large-scale in-context DiT-based models remains largely unexamined. In this paper, we propose DeContext, a new method to safeguard input images from unauthorized in-context editing. Our key insight is that contextual information from the source image propagates to the output primarily through multimodal attention layers. By injecting small, targeted perturbations that weaken these cross-attention pathways, DeContext breaks this flow, effectively decouples the link between input and output. This simple defense is both efficient and robust. We further show that early denoising steps and specific transformer blocks dominate context propagation, which allows us to concentrate perturbations where they matter most. Experiments on Flux Kontext and Step1X-Edit show that DeContext consistently blocks unwanted image edits while preserving visual quality. These results highlight the effectiveness of attention-based perturbations as a powerful defense against image manipulation.

*Danxu Liu,Di Wang,Hebaixu Wang,Haoyang Chen,Wentao Jiang,Yilin Cheng,Haonan Guo,Wei Cui,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SARMAE is a noise-aware masked autoencoder for self-supervised SAR representation learning that addresses data scarcity and speckle noise challenges through large-scale pre-training and SAR-specific noise injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR imagery faces data scarcity issues for deep learning, and the inherent speckle noise in SAR images hampers fine-grained semantic representation learning, creating challenges for SAR-oriented AI applications.

Method: Proposes SARMAE with three key components: 1) SAR-1M million-scale dataset with paired optical images, 2) Speckle-Aware Representation Enhancement (SARE) that injects SAR-specific speckle noise into masked autoencoders, and 3) Semantic Anchor Representation Constraint (SARC) that uses optical priors to align SAR features for semantic consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple SAR datasets show SARMAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on classification, detection, and segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: SARMAE effectively addresses SAR data scarcity and speckle noise challenges through self-supervised learning with noise-aware representation enhancement and semantic alignment, enabling robust SAR representation learning for various downstream tasks.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery plays a critical role in all-weather, day-and-night remote sensing applications. However, existing SAR-oriented deep learning is constrained by data scarcity, while the physically grounded speckle noise in SAR imagery further hampers fine-grained semantic representation learning. To address these challenges, we propose SARMAE, a Noise-Aware Masked Autoencoder for self-supervised SAR representation learning. Specifically, we construct SAR-1M, the first million-scale SAR dataset, with additional paired optical images, to enable large-scale pre-training. Building upon this, we design Speckle-Aware Representation Enhancement (SARE), which injects SAR-specific speckle noise into masked autoencoders to facilitate noise-aware and robust representation learning. Furthermore, we introduce Semantic Anchor Representation Constraint (SARC), which leverages paired optical priors to align SAR features and ensure semantic consistency. Extensive experiments across multiple SAR datasets demonstrate that SARMAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on classification, detection, and segmentation tasks. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/MiliLab/SARMAE.

*Giorgos Petsangourakis,Christos Sgouropoulos,Bill Psomas,Theodoros Giannakopoulos,Giorgos Sfikas,Ioannis Kakogeorgiou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: REGLUE improves latent diffusion models by jointly modeling VAE latents with compressed multi-layer VFM semantics using a unified SiT backbone, achieving better FID and faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LDMs have indirect semantic supervision that requires long training and limits quality. Existing VFM integration methods underutilize rich multi-layer spatial semantics from vision foundation models.

Method: Unified framework that jointly models VAE image latents, compressed local patch-level VFM semantics, and global [CLS] token in a single SiT backbone. Uses lightweight convolutional semantic compressor to aggregate multi-layer VFM features into low-dimensional spatial representations entangled with VAE latents during diffusion.

Result: Consistently improves FID and accelerates convergence on ImageNet 256x256 over SiT-B/2, SiT-XL/2 baselines and REPA, ReDi, REG methods. Shows spatial VFM semantics are crucial, nonlinear compression is key, and global tokens with external alignment provide complementary enhancements.

Conclusion: REGLUE demonstrates that jointly modeling global-local-latent representations with nonlinear compression of multi-layer VFM semantics significantly improves latent diffusion model performance and training efficiency.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve state-of-the-art image synthesis, yet their reconstruction-style denoising objective provides only indirect semantic supervision: high-level semantics emerge slowly, requiring longer training and limiting sample quality. Recent works inject semantics from Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) either externally via representation alignment or internally by jointly modeling only a narrow slice of VFM features inside the diffusion process, under-utilizing the rich, nonlinear, multi-layer spatial semantics available. We introduce REGLUE (Representation Entanglement with Global-Local Unified Encoding), a unified latent diffusion framework that jointly models (i) VAE image latents, (ii) compact local (patch-level) VFM semantics, and (iii) a global (image-level) [CLS] token within a single SiT backbone. A lightweight convolutional semantic compressor nonlinearly aggregates multi-layer VFM features into a low-dimensional, spatially structured representation, which is entangled with the VAE latents in the diffusion process. An external alignment loss further regularizes internal representations toward frozen VFM targets. On ImageNet 256x256, REGLUE consistently improves FID and accelerates convergence over SiT-B/2 and SiT-XL/2 baselines, as well as over REPA, ReDi, and REG. Extensive experiments show that (a) spatial VFM semantics are crucial, (b) non-linear compression is key to unlocking their full benefit, and (c) global tokens and external alignment act as complementary, lightweight enhancements within our global-local-latent joint modeling framework.

*Ole Beisswenger,Jan-Niklas Dihlmann,Hendrik P. A. Lensch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FrameDiffuser is an autoregressive neural rendering framework that generates temporally consistent, photorealistic frames from G-buffer data for interactive applications, using previous frame conditioning to maintain coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based approaches for G-buffer-conditioned image synthesis have limitations: single-image models lack temporal consistency, while video models are too computationally expensive and require complete sequences upfront, making them unsuitable for interactive applications where future frames depend on user input.

Method: Autoregressive framework that generates frames by conditioning on G-buffer data (geometry, materials, surface properties) and the model's own previous output. Uses dual-conditioning architecture combining ControlNet for structural guidance with ControlLoRA for temporal coherence, with a three-stage training strategy for stable autoregressive generation. Environment-specific training prioritizes consistency and inference speed over broad generalization.

Result: FrameDiffuser maintains stable, temporally consistent generation over hundreds to thousands of frames, achieving superior photorealistic quality with accurate lighting, shadows, and reflections compared to generalized approaches, while being suitable for interactive applications.

Conclusion: FrameDiffuser addresses critical limitations of existing approaches by providing an autoregressive neural rendering framework that balances temporal consistency, photorealistic quality, and computational efficiency for interactive applications, demonstrating that environment-specific training yields better results than generalized approaches.

Abstract: Neural rendering for interactive applications requires translating geometric and material properties (G-buffer) to photorealistic images with realistic lighting on a frame-by-frame basis. While recent diffusion-based approaches show promise for G-buffer-conditioned image synthesis, they face critical limitations: single-image models like RGBX generate frames independently without temporal consistency, while video models like DiffusionRenderer are too computationally expensive for most consumer gaming sets ups and require complete sequences upfront, making them unsuitable for interactive applications where future frames depend on user input. We introduce FrameDiffuser, an autoregressive neural rendering framework that generates temporally consistent, photorealistic frames by conditioning on G-buffer data and the models own previous output. After an initial frame, FrameDiffuser operates purely on incoming G-buffer data, comprising geometry, materials, and surface properties, while using its previously generated frame for temporal guidance, maintaining stable, temporal consistent generation over hundreds to thousands of frames. Our dual-conditioning architecture combines ControlNet for structural guidance with ControlLoRA for temporal coherence. A three-stage training strategy enables stable autoregressive generation. We specialize our model to individual environments, prioritizing consistency and inference speed over broad generalization, demonstrating that environment-specific training achieves superior photorealistic quality with accurate lighting, shadows, and reflections compared to generalized approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Subject fingerprinting using ResNet-50 with triplet loss achieves high re-identification accuracy on medical imaging datasets, addressing data leakage in combined open-source datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Combining open-source datasets can cause data leakage when the same subject appears in multiple sets, leading to inflated model performance. Need to identify and handle subject overlap across datasets.

Method: Subject fingerprinting approach that maps all images of a subject to a distinct region in latent space, enabling subject re-identification via similarity matching. Uses ResNet-50 trained with triplet margin loss, evaluated in few-shot scenarios (20-way 1-shot and challenging 1000-way 1-shot) on 3D MRI and 2D X-ray data.

Result: High Mean-Recall-@-K scores: 99.10% (20-way 1-shot) and 90.06% (500-way 5-shot) on ChestXray-14; 99.20% (20-way 1-shot) and 98.86% (100-way 3-shot) on BraTS-2021.

Conclusion: Subject fingerprinting effectively addresses data leakage in combined medical imaging datasets by enabling accurate subject re-identification across different imaging modalities and challenging few-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Combining open-source datasets can introduce data leakage if the same subject appears in multiple sets, leading to inflated model performance. To address this, we explore subject fingerprinting, mapping all images of a subject to a distinct region in latent space, to enable subject re-identification via similarity matching. Using a ResNet-50 trained with triplet margin loss, we evaluate few-shot fingerprinting on 3D MRI and 2D X-ray data in both standard (20-way 1-shot) and challenging (1000-way 1-shot) scenarios. The model achieves high Mean- Recall-@-K scores: 99.10% (20-way 1-shot) and 90.06% (500-way 5-shot) on ChestXray-14; 99.20% (20-way 1-shot) and 98.86% (100-way 3-shot) on BraTS- 2021.

*Serafino Pandolfini,Lorenzo Pellegrini,Matteo Ferrara,Davide Maltoni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Evaluates how well existing deepfake detectors trained on fully synthetic images can detect localized inpainting manipulations, finding partial transferability for medium/large-area edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As generative AI enables realistic localized image manipulations (inpainting/editing) that are exploited in cybersecurity threats, there's a need to understand if existing detectors trained on fully synthetic images can generalize to these localized manipulations.

Method: Systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art deepfake detectors on localized inpainting detection using multiple datasets with diverse generators, mask sizes, and inpainting techniques.

Result: Models trained on diverse generators show partial transferability to inpainting detection, reliably detecting medium- and large-area manipulations and regeneration-style inpainting, outperforming many existing ad hoc approaches.

Conclusion: Existing deepfake detectors have some generalization capability to localized manipulations, particularly for larger edits, but there remains a need for specialized approaches to address the full spectrum of inpainting-based threats.

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative AI has enabled highly realistic image manipulations, including inpainting and region-level editing. These approaches preserve most of the original visual context and are increasingly exploited in cybersecurity-relevant threat scenarios. While numerous detectors have been proposed for identifying fully synthetic images, their ability to generalize to localized manipulations remains insufficiently characterized. This work presents a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art detectors, originally trained for the deepfake detection on fully synthetic images, when applied to a distinct challenge: localized inpainting detection. The study leverages multiple datasets spanning diverse generators, mask sizes, and inpainting techniques. Our experiments show that models trained on a large set of generators exhibit partial transferability to inpainting-based edits and can reliably detect medium- and large-area manipulations or regeneration-style inpainting, outperforming many existing ad hoc detection approaches.

### [81] [SDFoam: Signed-Distance Foam for explicit surface reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16706)
*Antonella Rech,Nicola Conci,Nicola Garau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDFoam combines explicit Voronoi diagrams with implicit signed distance fields to improve mesh reconstruction quality in neural scene representation while maintaining rendering efficiency comparable to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like NeRF, 3D Gaussian Splatting, and RadiantFoam struggle with precise mesh reconstruction despite advances in view synthesis and rendering speed. There's a need for better surface reconstruction while maintaining efficiency.

Method: Jointly learns an explicit Voronoi Diagram with an implicit Signed Distance Field (SDF). The scene is optimized via ray tracing with Eikonal regularization. The SDF provides metric-consistent isosurfaces that bias Voronoi cell faces to align with the zero level set.

Result: Produces crisper, view-consistent surfaces with fewer floaters and improved topology while preserving photometric quality. Maintains training speed on par with RadiantFoam. Substantially improves mesh reconstruction accuracy (Chamfer distance) with comparable appearance metrics (PSNR, SSIM).

Conclusion: SDFoam's hybrid implicit-explicit formulation successfully addresses the mesh reconstruction gap in neural scene representation, achieving better surface quality without sacrificing efficiency or appearance quality.

Abstract: Neural radiance fields (NeRF) have driven impressive progress in view synthesis by using ray-traced volumetric rendering. Splatting-based methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) provide faster rendering by rasterizing 3D primitives. RadiantFoam (RF) brought ray tracing back, achieving throughput comparable to Gaussian Splatting by organizing radiance with an explicit Voronoi Diagram (VD). Yet, all the mentioned methods still struggle with precise mesh reconstruction. We address this gap by jointly learning an explicit VD with an implicit Signed Distance Field (SDF). The scene is optimized via ray tracing and regularized by an Eikonal objective. The SDF introduces metric-consistent isosurfaces, which, in turn, bias near-surface Voronoi cell faces to align with the zero level set. The resulting model produces crisper, view-consistent surfaces with fewer floaters and improved topology, while preserving photometric quality and maintaining training speed on par with RadiantFoam. Across diverse scenes, our hybrid implicit-explicit formulation, which we name SDFoam, substantially improves mesh reconstruction accuracy (Chamfer distance) with comparable appearance (PSNR, SSIM), without sacrificing efficiency.

TL;DR: First public multi-center, multi-device fetal ultrasound dataset with expert landmark annotations for all primary biometric measurements, enabling standardized benchmarking of AI methods for fetal growth assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual landmarking in fetal ultrasound is time-consuming, operator-dependent, and sensitive to scanner/site variability, limiting reproducibility of automated approaches. Need for multi-source annotated datasets to develop reliable AI-assisted fetal growth assessment methods.

Method: Created open benchmark dataset with 4,513 de-identified US images from 1,904 subjects across three clinical sites using seven different US devices. Provided standardized train/test splits, evaluation code, and baseline results. Used automatic biometry model to quantify domain shift effects.

Result: Dataset enables fair comparison of methods and demonstrates that single-center training/evaluation substantially overestimates performance compared to multi-center testing, highlighting importance of domain adaptation and multi-center generalization.

Conclusion: This first publicly available multi-center, multi-device landmark-annotated dataset covering all primary fetal biometry measures provides robust benchmark for domain adaptation and enables more reliable AI-assisted fetal growth assessment across clinical centers.

Abstract: Accurate fetal growth assessment from ultrasound (US) relies on precise biometry measured by manually identifying anatomical landmarks in standard planes. Manual landmarking is time-consuming, operator-dependent, and sensitive to variability across scanners and sites, limiting the reproducibility of automated approaches. There is a need for multi-source annotated datasets to develop artificial intelligence-assisted fetal growth assessment methods. To address this bottleneck, we present an open, multi-centre, multi-device benchmark dataset of fetal US images with expert anatomical landmark annotations for clinically used fetal biometric measurements. These measurements include head bi-parietal and occipito-frontal diameters, abdominal transverse and antero-posterior diameters, and femoral length. The dataset contains 4,513 de-identified US images from 1,904 subjects acquired at three clinical sites using seven different US devices. We provide standardised, subject-disjoint train/test splits, evaluation code, and baseline results to enable fair and reproducible comparison of methods. Using an automatic biometry model, we quantify domain shift and demonstrate that training and evaluation confined to a single centre substantially overestimate performance relative to multi-centre testing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available multi-centre, multi-device, landmark-annotated dataset that covers all primary fetal biometry measures, providing a robust benchmark for domain adaptation and multi-centre generalisation in fetal biometry and enabling more reliable AI-assisted fetal growth assessment across centres. All data, annotations, training code, and evaluation pipelines are made publicly available.

TL;DR: OMG-Bench is the first large-scale public benchmark for skeleton-based online micro gesture recognition, featuring 40 fine-grained gesture classes with 13,948 instances. The paper also proposes HMATr, a hierarchical memory-augmented transformer that outperforms SOTA methods by 7.6% in detection rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online micro gesture recognition from hand skeletons is critical for VR/AR interaction but faces challenges due to limited public datasets and task-specific algorithms. Micro gestures involve subtle motion patterns, making dataset construction with precise skeletons and frame-level annotations difficult.

Method: Developed a multi-view self-supervised pipeline to automatically generate skeleton data, complemented by heuristic rules and expert refinement for semi-automatic annotation. Proposed Hierarchical Memory-Augmented Transformer (HMATr), an end-to-end framework that unifies gesture detection and classification using hierarchical memory banks storing frame-level details and window-level semantics, with learnable position-aware queries initialized from memory.

Result: Created OMG-Bench with 40 fine-grained gesture classes, 13,948 instances across 1,272 sequences. HMATr outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.6% in detection rate, establishing a strong baseline for online micro gesture recognition.

Conclusion: The paper introduces the first large-scale public benchmark for skeleton-based online micro gesture recognition and proposes an effective framework (HMATr) that significantly advances the state-of-the-art, providing a solid foundation for future research in VR/AR interaction.

Abstract: Online micro gesture recognition from hand skeletons is critical for VR/AR interaction but faces challenges due to limited public datasets and task-specific algorithms. Micro gestures involve subtle motion patterns, which make constructing datasets with precise skeletons and frame-level annotations difficult. To this end, we develop a multi-view self-supervised pipeline to automatically generate skeleton data, complemented by heuristic rules and expert refinement for semi-automatic annotation. Based on this pipeline, we introduce OMG-Bench, the first large-scale public benchmark for skeleton-based online micro gesture recognition. It features 40 fine-grained gesture classes with 13,948 instances across 1,272 sequences, characterized by subtle motions, rapid dynamics, and continuous execution. To tackle these challenges, we propose Hierarchical Memory-Augmented Transformer (HMATr), an end-to-end framework that unifies gesture detection and classification by leveraging hierarchical memory banks which store frame-level details and window-level semantics to preserve historical context. In addition, it employs learnable position-aware queries initialized from the memory to implicitly encode gesture positions and semantics. Experiments show that HMATr outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.6\% in detection rate, establishing a strong baseline for online micro gesture recognition.

TL;DR: TODSynth framework uses multimodal diffusion transformer with triple attention and task-guided sampling to generate stable, task-oriented synthetic data for remote sensing semantic segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current synthetic data generation for remote sensing faces challenges with semantic mask control complexity and sampling quality uncertainty, limiting utility for downstream semantic segmentation tasks.

Method: Proposes TODSynth with Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) using unified triple attention (text-image-mask) and control-rectify flow matching (CRFM) that adjusts sampling directions guided by semantic loss during early high-plasticity stages.

Result: The approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art controllable generation methods, producing more stable and task-oriented synthetic data, particularly effective in few-shot and complex-scene scenarios.

Conclusion: TODSynth effectively addresses synthetic data generation challenges for remote sensing semantic segmentation through multimodal attention and task-guided sampling, bridging the gap between synthetic data and downstream tasks.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of controllable generation, training data synthesis has become a promising way to expand labeled datasets and alleviate manual annotation in remote sensing (RS). However, the complexity of semantic mask control and the uncertainty of sampling quality often limit the utility of synthetic data in downstream semantic segmentation tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a task-oriented data synthesis framework (TODSynth), including a Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) with unified triple attention and a plug-and-play sampling strategy guided by task feedback. Built upon the powerful DiT-based generative foundation model, we systematically evaluate different control schemes, showing that a text-image-mask joint attention scheme combined with full fine-tuning of the image and mask branches significantly enhances the effectiveness of RS semantic segmentation data synthesis, particularly in few-shot and complex-scene scenarios. Furthermore, we propose a control-rectify flow matching (CRFM) method, which dynamically adjusts sampling directions guided by semantic loss during the early high-plasticity stage, mitigating the instability of generated images and bridging the gap between synthetic data and downstream segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art controllable generation methods, producing more stable and task-oriented synthetic data for RS semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: Make-It-Poseable overcomes limitations of traditional methods by operating in latent space, enabling robust character posing with high-fidelity geometry and topological adaptability.

Abstract: Posing 3D characters is a fundamental task in computer graphics and vision. However, existing methods like auto-rigging and pose-conditioned generation often struggle with challenges such as inaccurate skinning weight prediction, topological imperfections, and poor pose conformance, limiting their robustness and generalizability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Make-It-Poseable, a novel feed-forward framework that reformulates character posing as a latent-space transformation problem. Instead of deforming mesh vertices as in traditional pipelines, our method reconstructs the character in new poses by directly manipulating its latent representation. At the core of our method is a latent posing transformer that manipulates shape tokens based on skeletal motion. This process is facilitated by a dense pose representation for precise control. To ensure high-fidelity geometry and accommodate topological changes, we also introduce a latent-space supervision strategy and an adaptive completion module. Our method demonstrates superior performance in posing quality. It also naturally extends to 3D editing applications like part replacement and refinement.

*Enis Baty,C. P. Bridges,Simon Hadfield*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowDet reformulates object detection using Conditional Flow Matching instead of diffusion, achieving faster performance scaling and better results than DiffusionDet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize object detection beyond diffusion-based approaches to a broader class of generative transport problems, enabling simpler and straighter transport paths for faster performance scaling.

Method: Uses Conditional Flow Matching techniques to frame object detection as a generative transport problem in bounding box space, maintaining ability to vary number of boxes and inference steps without retraining.

Result: Outperforms diffusion-based detection systems and non-generative baselines across various experiments, with gains up to +3.6% AP on COCO and +4.2% AP_rare on LVIS datasets.

Conclusion: FlowDet demonstrates that conditional flow matching provides a superior formulation for generative object detection compared to diffusion, offering faster performance scaling and better results in recall-constrained settings.

Abstract: We present FlowDet, the first formulation of object detection using modern Conditional Flow Matching techniques. This work follows from DiffusionDet, which originally framed detection as a generative denoising problem in the bounding box space via diffusion. We revisit and generalise this formulation to a broader class of generative transport problems, while maintaining the ability to vary the number of boxes and inference steps without re-training. In contrast to the curved stochastic transport paths induced by diffusion, FlowDet learns simpler and straighter paths resulting in faster scaling of detection performance as the number of inference steps grows. We find that this reformulation enables us to outperform diffusion based detection systems (as well as non-generative baselines) across a wide range of experiments, including various precision/recall operating points using multiple feature backbones and datasets. In particular, when evaluating under recall-constrained settings, we can highlight the effects of the generative transport without over-compensating with large numbers of proposals. This provides gains of up to +3.6% AP and +4.2% AP$_{rare}$ over DiffusionDet on the COCO and LVIS datasets, respectively.

To support these capabilities, we constructed a comprehensive data system that serves as the foundation for multimodal video creation. The framework is further empowered by efficient large-scale pre-training strategies and infrastructure optimizations for inference. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Kling-Omni demonstrates exceptional capabilities in in-context generation, reasoning-based editing, and multimodal instruction following.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing real datasets lack precise ground-truth annotations, while synthetic datasets lack realistic vehicle motion. There's a need for datasets that combine the annotation benefits of synthetic data with the authenticity of real-world trajectories.

Method: Generate a synthetic 3D environment and integrate real-world trajectories from SinD (a bird's-eye-view dataset recorded from drone footage) to create realistic synthetic trajectories.

Result: Created R3ST dataset that bridges the gap between synthetic data and realistic trajectories, providing both accurate multimodal ground-truth annotations and authentic human-driven vehicle trajectories.

Conclusion: R3ST advances trajectory forecasting research by offering a dataset that combines the annotation advantages of synthetic data with the realism of real-world vehicle motion.

Abstract: Datasets are essential to train and evaluate computer vision models used for traffic analysis and to enhance road safety. Existing real datasets fit real-world scenarios, capturing authentic road object behaviors, however, they typically lack precise ground-truth annotations. In contrast, synthetic datasets play a crucial role, allowing for the annotation of a large number of frames without additional costs or extra time. However, a general drawback of synthetic datasets is the lack of realistic vehicle motion, since trajectories are generated using AI models or rule-based systems. In this work, we introduce R3ST (Realistic 3D Synthetic Trajectories), a synthetic dataset that overcomes this limitation by generating a synthetic 3D environment and integrating real-world trajectories derived from SinD, a bird's-eye-view dataset recorded from drone footage. The proposed dataset closes the gap between synthetic data and realistic trajectories, advancing the research in trajectory forecasting of road vehicles, offering both accurate multimodal ground-truth annotations and authentic human-driven vehicle trajectories.

TL;DR: KineST is a kinematics-guided state space model that reconstructs realistic full-body poses from sparse AR/VR headset signals by integrating spatial-temporal dependencies with kinematic priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full-body motion tracking is crucial for AR/VR applications but challenging due to sparse signals from head-mounted displays. Existing methods have high computational costs or separate spatial-temporal modeling, making it difficult to balance accuracy, temporal coherence, and efficiency.

Method: Proposes KineST with two core innovations: 1) kinematics-guided bidirectional scanning that embeds kinematic priors within the State Space Duality framework to capture joint relationships, and 2) mixed spatiotemporal representation learning that tightly couples spatial and temporal contexts. Also introduces geometric angular velocity loss for physical constraints on rotational variations.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance in both accuracy and temporal consistency within a lightweight framework.

Conclusion: KineST effectively addresses the challenge of realistic full-body pose reconstruction from sparse AR/VR signals by integrating kinematic priors with spatiotemporal modeling, achieving better balance between accuracy, smoothness, and efficiency than existing methods.

Abstract: Full-body motion tracking plays an essential role in AR/VR applications, bridging physical and virtual interactions. However, it is challenging to reconstruct realistic and diverse full-body poses based on sparse signals obtained by head-mounted displays, which are the main devices in AR/VR scenarios. Existing methods for pose reconstruction often incur high computational costs or rely on separately modeling spatial and temporal dependencies, making it difficult to balance accuracy, temporal coherence, and efficiency. To address this problem, we propose KineST, a novel kinematics-guided state space model, which effectively extracts spatiotemporal dependencies while integrating local and global pose perception. The innovation comes from two core ideas. Firstly, in order to better capture intricate joint relationships, the scanning strategy within the State Space Duality framework is reformulated into kinematics-guided bidirectional scanning, which embeds kinematic priors. Secondly, a mixed spatiotemporal representation learning approach is employed to tightly couple spatial and temporal contexts, balancing accuracy and smoothness. Additionally, a geometric angular velocity loss is introduced to impose physically meaningful constraints on rotational variations for further improving motion stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KineST has superior performance in both accuracy and temporal consistency within a lightweight framework. Project page: https://kaka-1314.github.io/KineST/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DenseBEV introduces a novel two-stage anchor generation method using BEV feature cells directly as anchors for multi-camera 3D object detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance with efficient training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional BEV-based transformers use random queries as anchors, while recent approaches use detections from auxiliary networks. The authors propose a more intuitive approach using BEV feature cells directly as anchors to leverage the dense grid of BEV queries more effectively.

Method: 1) Uses BEV feature cells from encoders (like BEVFormer) directly as object queries, 2) Introduces BEV-based Non-Maximum Suppression to handle scaling issues with many queries while allowing gradient flow, 3) Employs hybrid temporal modeling by integrating prior detections with embedded temporal BEV information.

Result: Significant improvements on nuScenes dataset (NDS and mAP), especially for small objects (3.8% mAP increase for pedestrians). Achieves state-of-the-art LET-mAP of 60.7% on Waymo Open dataset, surpassing previous best by 5.4%, even with sparser BEV grids.

Conclusion: DenseBEV provides an efficient end-to-end approach for multi-camera 3D object detection that leverages BEV feature cells as anchors, handles query scaling effectively, and achieves superior performance particularly for small objects, establishing new state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: In current research, Bird's-Eye-View (BEV)-based transformers are increasingly utilized for multi-camera 3D object detection. Traditional models often employ random queries as anchors, optimizing them successively. Recent advancements complement or replace these random queries with detections from auxiliary networks. We propose a more intuitive and efficient approach by using BEV feature cells directly as anchors. This end-to-end approach leverages the dense grid of BEV queries, considering each cell as a potential object for the final detection task. As a result, we introduce a novel two-stage anchor generation method specifically designed for multi-camera 3D object detection. To address the scaling issues of attention with a large number of queries, we apply BEV-based Non-Maximum Suppression, allowing gradients to flow only through non-suppressed objects. This ensures efficient training without the need for post-processing. By using BEV features from encoders such as BEVFormer directly as object queries, temporal BEV information is inherently embedded. Building on the temporal BEV information already embedded in our object queries, we introduce a hybrid temporal modeling approach by integrating prior detections to further enhance detection performance. Evaluating our method on the nuScenes dataset shows consistent and significant improvements in NDS and mAP over the baseline, even with sparser BEV grids and therefore fewer initial anchors. It is particularly effective for small objects, enhancing pedestrian detection with a 3.8% mAP increase on nuScenes and an 8% increase in LET-mAP on Waymo. Applying our method, named DenseBEV, to the challenging Waymo Open dataset yields state-of-the-art performance, achieving a LET-mAP of 60.7%, surpassing the previous best by 5.4%.

TL;DR: GenEval benchmark has drifted from human judgment over time, showing 17.7% error for current models. Authors introduce GenEval 2 with better concept coverage and Soft-TIFA evaluation method to reduce future drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2I model evaluation faces benchmark drift problems where static benchmarks fail to keep up with evolving model capabilities, as shown with GenEval's declining alignment with human judgment over time.

Method: Introduce GenEval 2 benchmark with improved coverage of primitive visual concepts and higher compositionality, plus Soft-TIFA evaluation method that combines judgments for visual primitives rather than holistic scoring.

Result: GenEval has drifted significantly (up to 17.7% absolute error from human judgment), indicating saturation. GenEval 2 is more challenging for current models, and Soft-TIFA shows better alignment with human judgment than holistic judges like VQAScore.

Conclusion: Benchmark drift is a serious issue requiring continual audits and improvements. GenEval 2 and Soft-TIFA offer more robust evaluation, but avoiding drift long-term remains challenging and requires ongoing attention.

Abstract: Automating Text-to-Image (T2I) model evaluation is challenging; a judge model must be used to score correctness, and test prompts must be selected to be challenging for current T2I models but not the judge. We argue that satisfying these constraints can lead to benchmark drift over time, where the static benchmark judges fail to keep up with newer model capabilities. We show that benchmark drift is a significant problem for GenEval, one of the most popular T2I benchmarks. Although GenEval was well-aligned with human judgment at the time of its release, it has drifted far from human judgment over time -- resulting in an absolute error of as much as 17.7% for current models. This level of drift strongly suggests that GenEval has been saturated for some time, as we verify via a large-scale human study. To help fill this benchmarking gap, we introduce a new benchmark, GenEval 2, with improved coverage of primitive visual concepts and higher degrees of compositionality, which we show is more challenging for current models. We also introduce Soft-TIFA, an evaluation method for GenEval 2 that combines judgments for visual primitives, which we show is more well-aligned with human judgment and argue is less likely to drift from human-alignment over time (as compared to more holistic judges such as VQAScore). Although we hope GenEval 2 will provide a strong benchmark for many years, avoiding benchmark drift is far from guaranteed and our work, more generally, highlights the importance of continual audits and improvement for T2I and related automated model evaluation benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SOTA radiology report generation systems require large-scale multimodal training, clinical metadata, and multiple views, making them resource-intensive and inaccessible for most clinical settings.

Method: Combines frozen DINOv3 ViT encoder with GPT-2 decoder enhanced by layer-wise anatomical attention using lung/heart segmentation masks with hierarchical Gaussian smoothing to bias attention toward clinically relevant regions without adding trainable parameters.

Result: Achieved substantial gains on MIMIC-CXR: CheXpert Macro-F1 for 5 key pathologies increased 168% (0.083→0.238), Micro-F1 increased 146% (0.137→0.337), 14 observations improved 86% (0.170→0.316), and RadGraph F1 rose 9.7%.

Conclusion: Decoder-level anatomical guidance improves spatial grounding and coherence in clinically relevant regions, demonstrating effective radiology report generation with compact, purely image-conditioned design accessible to resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Automatic radiology report generation is a promising application of multimodal deep learning, aiming to reduce reporting workload and improve consistency. However, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) systems - such as Multimodal AI for Radiology Applications (MAIRA-2) and Medical Pathways Language Model-Multimodal (MedPaLM-M) - depend on large-scale multimodal training, clinical metadata, and multiple imaging views, making them resource-intensive and inaccessible for most settings. We introduce a compact image-to-text architecture that generates the Findings section of chest X-ray reports from a single frontal image. The model combines a frozen Self-Distillation with No Labels v3 (DINOv3) Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder with a Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2) decoder enhanced by layer-wise anatomical attention. This mechanism integrates lung and heart segmentation masks through hierarchical Gaussian smoothing, biasing attention toward clinically relevant regions without adding trainable parameters. Evaluated on the official Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-Chest X-ray (MIMIC-CXR) dataset using Chest Radiograph Expert (CheXpert) and Radiology Graph (RadGraph) metrics, our approach achieved substantial gains: CheXpert Macro-F1 for five key pathologies increased by 168% (0.083 -> 0.238) and Micro-F1 by 146% (0.137 -> 0.337), while broader performance across 14 observations improved by 86% (0.170 -> 0.316). Structural coherence also improved, with RadGraph F1 rising by 9.7%. Despite its small size and purely image-conditioned design, the model demonstrates that decoder-level anatomical guidance improves spatial grounding and enhances coherence in clinically relevant regions.

TL;DR: Pixel Seal introduces a new state-of-the-art image and video watermarking method that addresses fundamental issues in existing approaches through adversarial-only training, three-stage training schedule, and high-resolution adaptation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current invisible watermarking methods struggle to balance robustness and true imperceptibility, relying on proxy perceptual losses that fail to mimic human perception, suffering from optimization instability due to conflicting objectives, and experiencing reduced performance when scaling to high-resolution images and videos.

Method: 1) Adversarial-only training paradigm eliminating unreliable pixel-wise imperceptibility losses; 2) Three-stage training schedule decoupling robustness and imperceptibility for stable convergence; 3) High-resolution adaptation using JND-based attenuation and training-time inference simulation to eliminate upscaling artifacts; 4) Temporal watermark pooling for video adaptation.

Result: Pixel Seal achieves clear improvements over state-of-the-art methods in both robustness and imperceptibility across different image types and a wide range of transformations, and efficiently adapts to video applications.

Conclusion: Pixel Seal provides a practical and scalable solution for reliable provenance in real-world image and video settings, setting a new state-of-the-art for invisible watermarking by addressing fundamental limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Invisible watermarking is essential for tracing the provenance of digital content. However, training state-of-the-art models remains notoriously difficult, with current approaches often struggling to balance robustness against true imperceptibility. This work introduces Pixel Seal, which sets a new state-of-the-art for image and video watermarking. We first identify three fundamental issues of existing methods: (i) the reliance on proxy perceptual losses such as MSE and LPIPS that fail to mimic human perception and result in visible watermark artifacts; (ii) the optimization instability caused by conflicting objectives, which necessitates exhaustive hyperparameter tuning; and (iii) reduced robustness and imperceptibility of watermarks when scaling models to high-resolution images and videos. To overcome these issues, we first propose an adversarial-only training paradigm that eliminates unreliable pixel-wise imperceptibility losses. Second, we introduce a three-stage training schedule that stabilizes convergence by decoupling robustness and imperceptibility. Third, we address the resolution gap via high-resolution adaptation, employing JND-based attenuation and training-time inference simulation to eliminate upscaling artifacts. We thoroughly evaluate the robustness and imperceptibility of Pixel Seal on different image types and across a wide range of transformations, and show clear improvements over the state-of-the-art. We finally demonstrate that the model efficiently adapts to video via temporal watermark pooling, positioning Pixel Seal as a practical and scalable solution for reliable provenance in real-world image and video settings.

TL;DR: LinkedOut is a VLLM-based video representation that extracts world knowledge from raw frames for fast, multi-video recommendation without language bottlenecks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLLMs have deployment challenges for video recommendation: high latency from decode-only generation, lack of multi-video input support, and loss of fine-grained visual details when constrained to language outputs.

Method: LinkedOut extracts semantically grounded, knowledge-aware tokens from raw frames using VLLMs with promptable queries and optional auxiliary modalities, plus a cross-layer knowledge fusion MoE that selects appropriate abstraction levels from VLLM features.

Result: First VLLM-based video recommendation method operating on raw frames without handcrafted labels, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks with interpretable, low-latency performance.

Conclusion: LinkedOut provides a practical path to fully leverage VLLM world-knowledge priors and visual reasoning for downstream vision tasks like recommendation, overcoming current deployment limitations.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) unlock world-knowledge-aware video understanding through pretraining on internet-scale data and have already shown promise on tasks such as movie analysis and video question answering. However, deploying VLLMs for downstream tasks such as video recommendation remains challenging, since real systems require multi-video inputs, lightweight backbones, low-latency sequential inference, and rapid response. In practice, (1) decode-only generation yields high latency for sequential inference, (2) typical interfaces do not support multi-video inputs, and (3) constraining outputs to language discards fine-grained visual details that matter for downstream vision tasks. We argue that these limitations stem from the absence of a representation that preserves pixel-level detail while leveraging world knowledge. We present LinkedOut, a representation that extracts VLLM world knowledge directly from video to enable fast inference, supports multi-video histories, and removes the language bottleneck. LinkedOut extracts semantically grounded, knowledge-aware tokens from raw frames using VLLMs, guided by promptable queries and optional auxiliary modalities. We introduce a cross-layer knowledge fusion MoE that selects the appropriate level of abstraction from the rich VLLM features, enabling personalized, interpretable, and low-latency recommendation. To our knowledge, LinkedOut is the first VLLM-based video recommendation method that operates on raw frames without handcrafted labels, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks. Interpretability studies and ablations confirm the benefits of layer diversity and layer-wise fusion, pointing to a practical path that fully leverages VLLM world-knowledge priors and visual reasoning for downstream vision tasks such as recommendation.

*Tianyuan Qu,Lei Ke,Xiaohang Zhan,Longxiang Tang,Yuqi Liu,Bohao Peng,Bei Yu,Dong Yu,Jiaya Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RePlan is a plan-then-execute framework for complex image editing that uses a vision-language planner to decompose instructions and ground them to regions, then executes edits via attention-region injection, outperforming baselines on challenging IV-Complexity tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing instruction-based image editing models struggle with Instruction-Visual Complexity (IV-Complexity) where intricate instructions meet cluttered or ambiguous scenes, requiring better handling of fine-grained grounding and knowledge-intensive edits.

Method: RePlan uses a two-stage framework: 1) A vision-language planner decomposes instructions via step-by-step reasoning and explicitly grounds them to target regions, 2) A diffusion editor applies changes using training-free attention-region injection for precise, parallel multi-region edits without iterative inpainting. Enhanced with GRPO-based reinforcement learning on 1K instruction-only examples.

Result: RePlan consistently outperforms strong baselines trained on far larger datasets across IV-Complex settings, improving regional precision and overall fidelity. Also introduces IV-Edit benchmark for fine-grained grounding and knowledge-intensive edits.

Conclusion: The RePlan framework effectively addresses IV-Complexity in image editing through explicit planning and region-aligned execution, demonstrating superior performance on complex editing tasks while requiring minimal training data.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing enables natural-language control over visual modifications, yet existing models falter under Instruction-Visual Complexity (IV-Complexity), where intricate instructions meet cluttered or ambiguous scenes. We introduce RePlan (Region-aligned Planning), a plan-then-execute framework that couples a vision-language planner with a diffusion editor. The planner decomposes instructions via step-by-step reasoning and explicitly grounds them to target regions; the editor then applies changes using a training-free attention-region injection mechanism, enabling precise, parallel multi-region edits without iterative inpainting. To strengthen planning, we apply GRPO-based reinforcement learning using 1K instruction-only examples, yielding substantial gains in reasoning fidelity and format reliability. We further present IV-Edit, a benchmark focused on fine-grained grounding and knowledge-intensive edits. Across IV-Complex settings, RePlan consistently outperforms strong baselines trained on far larger datasets, improving regional precision and overall fidelity.

*Valay Bundele,Mehran Hosseinzadeh,Hendrik P. A. Lensch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReMeDI-SAM3 enhances SAM3 for surgical instrument segmentation with training-free memory improvements: relevance-aware filtering, piecewise interpolation for capacity, and feature-based re-identification for occlusion recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surgical instrument segmentation in endoscopic videos is challenging due to occlusions, rapid motion, specular artifacts, and instrument re-entry. While SAM3 provides a spatio-temporal framework, it suffers from indiscriminate memory updates, fixed capacity, and weak identity recovery after occlusions.

Method: Three training-free components: (1) relevance-aware memory filtering with occlusion-aware memory for pre-occlusion frames, (2) piecewise interpolation scheme to expand effective memory capacity, and (3) feature-based re-identification module with temporal voting for post-occlusion identity disambiguation.

Result: Evaluations on EndoVis17 and EndoVis18 show absolute mcIoU improvements of ~7% and ~16% respectively over vanilla SAM3 in zero-shot setting, outperforming prior training-based approaches.

Conclusion: ReMeDI-SAM3 effectively addresses SAM3's limitations for surgical scenes through memory enhancements, achieving state-of-the-art performance without training while enabling reliable recovery after occlusions.

Abstract: Accurate surgical instrument segmentation in endoscopic videos is crucial for computer-assisted interventions, yet remains challenging due to frequent occlusions, rapid motion, specular artefacts, and long-term instrument re-entry. While SAM3 provides a powerful spatio-temporal framework for video object segmentation, its performance in surgical scenes is limited by indiscriminate memory updates, fixed memory capacity, and weak identity recovery after occlusions. We propose ReMeDI-SAM3, a training-free memory-enhanced extension of SAM3, that addresses these limitations through three components: (i) relevance-aware memory filtering with a dedicated occlusion-aware memory for storing pre-occlusion frames, (ii) a piecewise interpolation scheme that expands the effective memory capacity, and (iii) a feature-based re-identification module with temporal voting for reliable post-occlusion identity disambiguation. Together, these components mitigate error accumulation and enable reliable recovery after occlusions. Evaluations on EndoVis17 and EndoVis18 under a zero-shot setting show absolute mcIoU improvements of around 7% and 16%, respectively, over vanilla SAM3, outperforming even prior training-based approaches.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that a simplified design approach with careful data composition and unified control mechanisms can create an effective framework for instruction-based video editing that outperforms existing solutions.

Abstract: While image editing has advanced rapidly, video editing remains less explored, facing challenges in consistency, control, and generalization. We study the design space of data, architecture, and control, and introduce \emph{EasyV2V}, a simple and effective framework for instruction-based video editing. On the data side, we compose existing experts with fast inverses to build diverse video pairs, lift image edit pairs into videos via single-frame supervision and pseudo pairs with shared affine motion, mine dense-captioned clips for video pairs, and add transition supervision to teach how edits unfold. On the model side, we observe that pretrained text-to-video models possess editing capability, motivating a simplified design. Simple sequence concatenation for conditioning with light LoRA fine-tuning suffices to train a strong model. For control, we unify spatiotemporal control via a single mask mechanism and support optional reference images. Overall, EasyV2V works with flexible inputs, e.g., video+text, video+mask+text, video+mask+reference+text, and achieves state-of-the-art video editing results, surpassing concurrent and commercial systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for estimating physical material parameters assume homogeneous single-material objects, pre-learned dynamics, or simple topologies, but real-world objects often have complex material compositions and geometries that break these assumptions.

Method: Multi-material Physical Gaussians (M-PhyGs) jointly segments objects into similar materials and recovers continuum mechanical parameters from video using cascaded 3D and 2D losses, temporal mini-batching, and accounting for gravity.

Result: Experimental results on the Phlowers dataset demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of M-PhyGs and its components for multi-material physical parameter estimation.

Conclusion: M-PhyGs provides an effective approach for estimating material composition and physical parameters of complex multi-material natural objects like flowers from visual data, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Knowledge of the physical material properties governing the dynamics of a real-world object becomes necessary to accurately anticipate its response to unseen interactions. Existing methods for estimating such physical material parameters from visual data assume homogeneous single-material objects, pre-learned dynamics, or simplistic topologies. Real-world objects, however, are often complex in material composition and geometry lying outside the realm of these assumptions. In this paper, we particularly focus on flowers as a representative common object. We introduce Multi-material Physical Gaussians (M-PhyGs) to estimate the material composition and parameters of such multi-material complex natural objects from video. From a short video captured in a natural setting, M-PhyGs jointly segments the object into similar materials and recovers their continuum mechanical parameters while accounting for gravity. M-PhyGs achieves this efficiently with newly introduced cascaded 3D and 2D losses, and by leveraging temporal mini-batching. We introduce a dataset, Phlowers, of people interacting with flowers as a novel platform to evaluate the accuracy of this challenging task of multi-material physical parameter estimation. Experimental results on Phlowers dataset demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of M-PhyGs and its components.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional MLLM evaluation methods lack interpretability and fail to fully reveal significant capability gaps across models, creating a need for more effective diagnostic approaches.

Method: Fine-tunes an MLLM as an auditor via reinforcement learning to generate challenging questions and counterfactual images that maximize disagreement among target models, uncovering diverse failure types as interpretable exemplars.

Result: Applied to SoTA models like Gemma-3 and PaliGemma-2, AuditDM discovered more than 20 distinct failure types. Fine-tuning on these discoveries consistently improved all models across 16 benchmarks, enabling a 3B model to surpass its 28B counterpart.

Conclusion: As data scaling hits diminishing returns, targeted model auditing offers an effective path to model diagnosis and improvement, with AuditDM providing an automated framework for discovering and rectifying MLLM failure modes.

Abstract: Conventional evaluation methods for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) lack interpretability and are often insufficient to fully disclose significant capability gaps across models. To address this, we introduce AuditDM, an automated framework that actively discovers and rectifies MLLM failure modes by auditing their divergence. AuditDM fine-tunes an MLLM as an auditor via reinforcement learning to generate challenging questions and counterfactual images that maximize disagreement among target models. Once trained, the auditor uncovers diverse, interpretable exemplars that reveal model weaknesses and serve as annotation-free data for rectification. When applied to SoTA models like Gemma-3 and PaliGemma-2, AuditDM discovers more than 20 distinct failure types. Fine-tuning on these discoveries consistently improves all models across 16 benchmarks, and enables a 3B model to surpass its 28B counterpart. Our results suggest that as data scaling hits diminishing returns, targeted model auditing offers an effective path to model diagnosis and improvement.

TL;DR: Instant4D: Distills 2D diffusion knowledge into feed-forward encoder for fast, 3D-consistent portrait animation from single images


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2D video diffusion models lack 3D consistency and speed, while 3D-aware methods have inferior expression details. Need to combine strengths of both approaches for real-world applications like digital twins.

Method: Knowledge distillation from 2D diffusion model into feed-forward encoder; decoupled animation representation learning motion implicitly; efficient lightweight local fusion instead of global attention mechanisms.

Result: Runs at 107.31 FPS for animation and pose control while achieving comparable quality to state-of-the-art, surpassing designs that trade speed for quality.

Conclusion: Successfully combines 2D diffusion quality with 3D consistency and speed through efficient distillation and local fusion, enabling practical real-world applications.

Abstract: Portrait animation has witnessed tremendous quality improvements thanks to recent advances in video diffusion models. However, these 2D methods often compromise 3D consistency and speed, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios, such as digital twins or telepresence. In contrast, 3D-aware facial animation feedforward methods -- built upon explicit 3D representations, such as neural radiance fields or Gaussian splatting -- ensure 3D consistency and achieve faster inference speed, but come with inferior expression details. In this paper, we aim to combine their strengths by distilling knowledge from a 2D diffusion-based method into a feed-forward encoder, which instantly converts an in-the-wild single image into a 3D-consistent, fast yet expressive animatable representation. Our animation representation is decoupled from the face's 3D representation and learns motion implicitly from data, eliminating the dependency on pre-defined parametric models that often constrain animation capabilities. Unlike previous computationally intensive global fusion mechanisms (e.g., multiple attention layers) for fusing 3D structural and animation information, our design employs an efficient lightweight local fusion strategy to achieve high animation expressivity. As a result, our method runs at 107.31 FPS for animation and pose control while achieving comparable animation quality to the state-of-the-art, surpassing alternative designs that trade speed for quality or vice versa.

TL;DR: FlashPortrait: An end-to-end video diffusion transformer that generates ID-consistent long portrait animations with 6x faster inference using dynamic sliding windows and higher-order latent derivative prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based methods for long portrait animation struggle with identity consistency and have slow inference speeds. There's a need for a solution that can maintain identity preservation while accelerating the generation process for infinite-length videos.

Method: Uses identity-agnostic facial expression features from an off-the-shelf extractor, introduces Normalized Facial Expression Block to align features with diffusion latents, employs dynamic sliding-window with weighted blending for smooth transitions, and predicts future latents using higher-order latent derivatives to skip denoising steps.

Result: Achieves up to 6x acceleration in inference speed while maintaining identity consistency in long portrait animations. Experiments show effectiveness both qualitatively and quantitatively on benchmarks.

Conclusion: FlashPortrait successfully addresses the identity consistency problem in long portrait animation while significantly accelerating inference, making it practical for generating infinite-length ID-preserving portrait videos.

Abstract: Current diffusion-based acceleration methods for long-portrait animation struggle to ensure identity (ID) consistency. This paper presents FlashPortrait, an end-to-end video diffusion transformer capable of synthesizing ID-preserving, infinite-length videos while achieving up to 6x acceleration in inference speed. In particular, FlashPortrait begins by computing the identity-agnostic facial expression features with an off-the-shelf extractor. It then introduces a Normalized Facial Expression Block to align facial features with diffusion latents by normalizing them with their respective means and variances, thereby improving identity stability in facial modeling. During inference, FlashPortrait adopts a dynamic sliding-window scheme with weighted blending in overlapping areas, ensuring smooth transitions and ID consistency in long animations. In each context window, based on the latent variation rate at particular timesteps and the derivative magnitude ratio among diffusion layers, FlashPortrait utilizes higher-order latent derivatives at the current timestep to directly predict latents at future timesteps, thereby skipping several denoising steps and achieving 6x speed acceleration. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness of FlashPortrait both qualitatively and quantitatively.

TL;DR: Alchemist is a meta-gradient-based framework that automatically selects high-quality subsets from large-scale text-image data for T2I model training, improving data efficiency and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2I models are limited by low-quality web-crawled/synthetic training data containing redundant or poor samples, leading to degraded visual fidelity and inefficient training. Existing data selection methods rely on manual curation or heuristic scoring, lacking automated, scalable solutions for image modalities.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Data rating - train lightweight rater using meta-gradients with multi-granularity perception to estimate each sample's influence; 2) Data pruning - use Shift-Gsampling strategy to select informative subsets for efficient model training.

Result: Alchemist consistently improves visual quality and downstream performance. Training on just 50% of data selected by Alchemist can outperform training on the full dataset across both synthetic and web-crawled datasets.

Conclusion: Alchemist is the first automatic, scalable, meta-gradient-based data selection framework for T2I training, enabling more efficient use of training data while improving model quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models, such as Imagen, Stable Diffusion, and FLUX, have led to remarkable improvements in visual quality. However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality of training data. Web-crawled and synthetic image datasets often contain low-quality or redundant samples, which lead to degraded visual fidelity, unstable training, and inefficient computation. Hence, effective data selection is crucial for improving data efficiency. Existing approaches rely on costly manual curation or heuristic scoring based on single-dimensional features in Text-to-Image data filtering. Although meta-learning based method has been explored in LLM, there is no adaptation for image modalities. To this end, we propose **Alchemist**, a meta-gradient-based framework to select a suitable subset from large-scale text-image data pairs. Our approach automatically learns to assess the influence of each sample by iteratively optimizing the model from a data-centric perspective. Alchemist consists of two key stages: data rating and data pruning. We train a lightweight rater to estimate each sample's influence based on gradient information, enhanced with multi-granularity perception. We then use the Shift-Gsampling strategy to select informative subsets for efficient model training. Alchemist is the first automatic, scalable, meta-gradient-based data selection framework for Text-to-Image model training. Experiments on both synthetic and web-crawled datasets demonstrate that Alchemist consistently improves visual quality and downstream performance. Training on an Alchemist-selected 50% of the data can outperform training on the full dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based video editing methods are limited by training on simple editing operations, creating a generalization gap for complex real-world instructions.

Method: Uses VLM-based instructor for visually-grounded instruction encoding, Edit-GRPO reward optimization for instruction-faithful edits, and synthetic data pipeline for diverse training data.

Result: VIVA achieves superior instruction following, generalization, and editing quality over state-of-the-art methods in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: VIVA addresses the generalization gap in instruction-based video editing through scalable VLM-guided encoding and reward optimization, enabling handling of diverse real-world instructions.

Abstract: Instruction-based video editing aims to modify an input video according to a natural-language instruction while preserving content fidelity and temporal coherence. However, existing diffusion-based approaches are often trained on paired data of simple editing operations, which fundamentally limits their ability to generalize to diverse and complex, real-world instructions. To address this generalization gap, we propose VIVA, a scalable framework for instruction-based video editing that leverages VLM-guided encoding and reward optimization. First, we introduce a VLM-based instructor that encodes the textual instruction, the first frame of the source video, and an optional reference image into visually-grounded instruction representations, providing fine-grained spatial and semantic context for the diffusion transformer backbone. Second, we propose a post-training stage, Edit-GRPO, which adapts Group Relative Policy Optimization to the domain of video editing, directly optimizing the model for instruction-faithful, content-preserving, and aesthetically pleasing edits using relative rewards. Furthermore, we propose a data construction pipeline designed to synthetically generate diverse, high-fidelity paired video-instruction data of basic editing operations. Extensive experiments show that VIVA achieves superior instruction following, generalization, and editing quality over state-of-the-art methods. Website: https://viva-paper.github.io

Conclusion: SceneDiff method effectively addresses multiview change detection challenges, and the new benchmark with object instance annotations will be publicly released to advance research in this area.

Abstract: We investigate the problem of identifying objects that have been added, removed, or moved between a pair of captures (images or videos) of the same scene at different times. Detecting such changes is important for many applications, such as robotic tidying or construction progress and safety monitoring. A major challenge is that varying viewpoints can cause objects to falsely appear changed.

TL;DR: SFTok is a novel discrete image tokenizer with multi-step iterative reconstruction that achieves state-of-the-art performance at high compression rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete tokenizers lag behind continuous ones in multimodal systems despite their natural alignment with autoregressive paradigms, limiting their adoption in high-resolution image generation.

Method: SFTok incorporates a multi-step iterative mechanism with self-forcing guided visual reconstruction and debias-and-fitting training strategy to resolve training-inference inconsistency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality on ImageNet (rFID = 1.21) with only 64 tokens per image and exceptional class-to-image generation performance (gFID = 2.29).

Conclusion: SFTok demonstrates that discrete tokenizers can achieve superior performance through proper architectural design and training strategies, advancing multimodal image generation capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models highlight the pivotal role of image tokenization in high-resolution image generation. By compressing images into compact latent representations, tokenizers enable generative models to operate in lower-dimensional spaces, thereby improving computational efficiency and reducing complexity. Discrete tokenizers naturally align with the autoregressive paradigm but still lag behind continuous ones, limiting their adoption in multimodal systems. To address this, we propose \textbf{SFTok}, a discrete tokenizer that incorporates a multi-step iterative mechanism for precise reconstruction. By integrating \textbf{self-forcing guided visual reconstruction} and \textbf{debias-and-fitting training strategy}, SFTok resolves the training-inference inconsistency in multi-step process, significantly enhancing image reconstruction quality. At a high compression rate of only 64 tokens per image, SFTok achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality on ImageNet (rFID = 1.21) and demonstrates exceptional performance in class-to-image generation tasks (gFID = 2.29).

Motivation: To create a robust panoramic depth estimation model that works across diverse scene distances (indoor/outdoor, near/far) and generalizes well to real-world scenarios, addressing domain gaps between different data sources.

Method: Three-stage pseudo-label curation pipeline for reliable ground truth generation, DINOv3-Large backbone for generalization, plus range mask head, sharpness-centric optimization, and geometry-centric optimization for distance robustness and view consistency.

Result: Strong performance on multiple benchmarks (Stanford2D3D, Matterport3D, Deep360) with robust zero-shot generalization and stable metric predictions in diverse real-world scenes.

Conclusion: The proposed panoramic metric depth foundation model effectively generalizes across diverse distances through data-in-the-loop paradigm and specialized optimizations, demonstrating practical applicability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: In this work, we present a panoramic metric depth foundation model that generalizes across diverse scene distances. We explore a data-in-the-loop paradigm from the view of both data construction and framework design. We collect a large-scale dataset by combining public datasets, high-quality synthetic data from our UE5 simulator and text-to-image models, and real panoramic images from the web. To reduce domain gaps between indoor/outdoor and synthetic/real data, we introduce a three-stage pseudo-label curation pipeline to generate reliable ground truth for unlabeled images. For the model, we adopt DINOv3-Large as the backbone for its strong pre-trained generalization, and introduce a plug-and-play range mask head, sharpness-centric optimization, and geometry-centric optimization to improve robustness to varying distances and enforce geometric consistency across views. Experiments on multiple benchmarks (e.g., Stanford2D3D, Matterport3D, and Deep360) demonstrate strong performance and zero-shot generalization, with particularly robust and stable metric predictions in diverse real-world scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High demand for stereo video content but current production is costly/complex, and existing DWI pipeline suffers from error propagation, depth ambiguity, and format inconsistency between parallel/converged stereo configurations.

Method: Introduce UniStereo (first large-scale unified dataset for stereo video conversion covering both formats), then propose StereoPilot (efficient feed-forward model that directly synthesizes target view without depth maps or iterative diffusion sampling) with learnable domain switcher and cycle consistency loss.

Result: StereoPilot significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both visual fidelity and computational efficiency, adapting seamlessly to different stereo formats with improved consistency.

Conclusion: The proposed approach addresses limitations of traditional DWI pipeline by providing unified dataset and efficient direct synthesis model for high-quality stereo video conversion.

Abstract: The rapid growth of stereoscopic displays, including VR headsets and 3D cinemas, has led to increasing demand for high-quality stereo video content. However, producing 3D videos remains costly and complex, while automatic Monocular-to-Stereo conversion is hindered by the limitations of the multi-stage ``Depth-Warp-Inpaint'' (DWI) pipeline. This paradigm suffers from error propagation, depth ambiguity, and format inconsistency between parallel and converged stereo configurations. To address these challenges, we introduce UniStereo, the first large-scale unified dataset for stereo video conversion, covering both stereo formats to enable fair benchmarking and robust model training. Building upon this dataset, we propose StereoPilot, an efficient feed-forward model that directly synthesizes the target view without relying on explicit depth maps or iterative diffusion sampling. Equipped with a learnable domain switcher and a cycle consistency loss, StereoPilot adapts seamlessly to different stereo formats and achieves improved consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StereoPilot significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both visual fidelity and computational efficiency.

TL;DR: AdaTooler-V is an MLLM that adaptively decides when to use vision tools, avoiding unnecessary tool invocations that degrade performance and increase overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs often exhibit "blind tool-use" patterns, invoking vision tools even when unnecessary, which increases inference overhead and degrades performance. There's a need for models that can intelligently determine when visual tools are genuinely beneficial.

Method: Proposes AdaTooler-V with AT-GRPO reinforcement learning algorithm that adaptively adjusts reward scales based on Tool Benefit Score, encouraging tool use only when beneficial. Constructs two datasets: AdaTooler-V-CoT-100k for SFT cold start and AdaTooler-V-300k for RL training across single-image, multi-image, and video data.

Result: Outperforms existing methods across twelve benchmarks, with AdaTooler-V-7B achieving 89.8% accuracy on V* benchmark, surpassing commercial models GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro.

Conclusion: AdaTooler-V demonstrates strong adaptive tool-use reasoning capability, effectively balancing tool invocation with performance optimization, and sets new state-of-the-art results while being open-source.

Abstract: Recent advances have shown that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) benefit from multimodal interleaved chain-of-thought (CoT) with vision tool interactions. However, existing open-source models often exhibit blind tool-use reasoning patterns, invoking vision tools even when they are unnecessary, which significantly increases inference overhead and degrades model performance. To this end, we propose AdaTooler-V, an MLLM that performs adaptive tool-use by determining whether a visual problem truly requires tools. First, we introduce AT-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that adaptively adjusts reward scales based on the Tool Benefit Score of each sample, encouraging the model to invoke tools only when they provide genuine improvements. Moreover, we construct two datasets to support training: AdaTooler-V-CoT-100k for SFT cold start and AdaTooler-V-300k for RL with verifiable rewards across single-image, multi-image, and video data. Experiments across twelve benchmarks demonstrate the strong reasoning capability of AdaTooler-V, outperforming existing methods in diverse visual reasoning tasks. Notably, AdaTooler-V-7B achieves an accuracy of 89.8\% on the high-resolution benchmark V*, surpassing the commercial proprietary model GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro. All code, models, and data are released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NEPA is a self-supervised visual learning method that trains models to predict future patch embeddings from past ones using autoregressive prediction, achieving strong ImageNet and segmentation results without complex designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the success of generative pretraining in NLP and asks whether similar principles can work for visual self-supervised learning, shifting from learning representations to learning models that can perform predictive tasks directly.

Method: Next-Embedding Predictive Autoregression (NEPA) trains models to predict future patch embeddings conditioned on past ones using causal masking and stop gradient. It uses simple Transformer architecture pretrained on ImageNet-1k with next embedding prediction as the sole objective, avoiding pixel reconstruction, discrete tokens, contrastive loss, or task-specific heads.

Result: NEPA achieves 83.8% and 85.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with ViT-B and ViT-L backbones after fine-tuning, and transfers effectively to semantic segmentation on ADE20K, demonstrating strong performance across tasks.

Conclusion: Generative pretraining from embeddings provides a simple, scalable, and potentially modality-agnostic alternative to visual self-supervised learning, retaining architectural simplicity without requiring additional design complexity.

Abstract: Inspired by the success of generative pretraining in natural language, we ask whether the same principles can yield strong self-supervised visual learners. Instead of training models to output features for downstream use, we train them to generate embeddings to perform predictive tasks directly. This work explores such a shift from learning representations to learning models. Specifically, models learn to predict future patch embeddings conditioned on past ones, using causal masking and stop gradient, which we refer to as Next-Embedding Predictive Autoregression (NEPA). We demonstrate that a simple Transformer pretrained on ImageNet-1k with next embedding prediction as its sole learning objective is effective - no pixel reconstruction, discrete tokens, contrastive loss, or task-specific heads. This formulation retains architectural simplicity and scalability, without requiring additional design complexity. NEPA achieves strong results across tasks, attaining 83.8% and 85.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with ViT-B and ViT-L backbones after fine-tuning, and transferring effectively to semantic segmentation on ADE20K. We believe generative pretraining from embeddings provides a simple, scalable, and potentially modality-agnostic alternative to visual self-supervised learning.

*Chun-Wei Tuan Mu,Jia-Bin Huang,Yu-Lun Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-step generative approach for single-image refocusing using DeblurNet for all-in-focus recovery and BokehNet for controllable bokeh synthesis, trained with semi-supervised learning combining synthetic and real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depth-of-field control is essential in photography but difficult to achieve with single images. Current methods require all-in-focus inputs, rely on synthetic data, and offer limited aperture control.

Method: Two-step process: DeblurNet recovers all-in-focus images from various inputs, then BokehNet creates controllable bokeh. Uses semi-supervised training combining synthetic paired data with unpaired real bokeh images, leveraging EXIF metadata to capture real optical characteristics.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in defocus deblurring, bokeh synthesis, and refocusing benchmarks. Enables text-guided adjustments and custom aperture shapes.

Conclusion: Generative Refocusing provides an effective solution for single-image refocusing with realistic bokeh effects and enhanced control capabilities, overcoming limitations of existing methods through semi-supervised training with real optical data.

Abstract: Depth-of-field control is essential in photography, but getting the perfect focus often takes several tries or special equipment. Single-image refocusing is still difficult. It involves recovering sharp content and creating realistic bokeh. Current methods have significant drawbacks. They need all-in-focus inputs, depend on synthetic data from simulators, and have limited control over aperture. We introduce Generative Refocusing, a two-step process that uses DeblurNet to recover all-in-focus images from various inputs and BokehNet for creating controllable bokeh. Our main innovation is semi-supervised training. This method combines synthetic paired data with unpaired real bokeh images, using EXIF metadata to capture real optical characteristics beyond what simulators can provide. Our experiments show we achieve top performance in defocus deblurring, bokeh synthesis, and refocusing benchmarks. Additionally, our Generative Refocusing allows text-guided adjustments and custom aperture shapes.

TL;DR: WorldCanvas is a multimodal framework for generating controllable world events using text, motion trajectories, and reference images, enabling rich user-directed simulations with temporal coherence and object consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches have limitations: text-only methods lack visual grounding and motion control, while trajectory-controlled image-to-video methods lack semantic intent. There's a need for a framework that combines these modalities to enable rich, user-directed simulation of complex world events.

Method: WorldCanvas combines three modalities: 1) trajectories encoding motion, timing, and visibility, 2) natural language for semantic intent, and 3) reference images for visual grounding of object identity. This multimodal approach enables generation of coherent, controllable events including multi-agent interactions, object entry/exit, reference-guided appearance, and counterintuitive events.

Result: The framework generates videos with temporal coherence and emergent consistency, preserving object identity and scene despite temporary disappearance. It supports expressive world events generation and advances world models from passive predictors to interactive, user-shaped simulators.

Conclusion: WorldCanvas represents an advancement in world modeling by enabling interactive, user-directed simulation through multimodal promptable events, moving beyond passive prediction to active, controllable world simulation.

Abstract: We present WorldCanvas, a framework for promptable world events that enables rich, user-directed simulation by combining text, trajectories, and reference images. Unlike text-only approaches and existing trajectory-controlled image-to-video methods, our multimodal approach combines trajectories -- encoding motion, timing, and visibility -- with natural language for semantic intent and reference images for visual grounding of object identity, enabling the generation of coherent, controllable events that include multi-agent interactions, object entry/exit, reference-guided appearance and counterintuitive events. The resulting videos demonstrate not only temporal coherence but also emergent consistency, preserving object identity and scene despite temporary disappearance. By supporting expressive world events generation, WorldCanvas advances world models from passive predictors to interactive, user-shaped simulators.

Abstract: We present Anubuddhi, a multi-agent AI system that designs and simulates quantum optics experiments from natural language prompts without requiring specialized programming knowledge. The system composes optical layouts by arranging components from a three-tier toolbox via semantic retrieval, then validates designs through physics simulation with convergent refinement. The architecture combines intent routing, knowledge-augmented generation, and dual-mode validation (QuTiP and FreeSim). We evaluated 13 experiments spanning fundamental optics (Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, Michelson/Mach-Zehnder interferometry, Bell states, delayed-choice quantum eraser), quantum information protocols (BB84 QKD, Franson interferometry, GHZ states, quantum teleportation, hyperentanglement), and advanced technologies (boson sampling, electromagnetically induced transparency, frequency conversion). The system achieves design-simulation alignment scores of 8--9/10, with simulations faithfully modeling intended physics. A critical finding distinguishes structural correctness from quantitative accuracy: high alignment confirms correct physics architecture, while numerical predictions require expert review. Free-form simulation outperformed constrained frameworks for 11/13 experiments, revealing that quantum optics diversity demands flexible mathematical representations. The system democratizes computational experiment design for research and pedagogy, producing strong initial designs users can iteratively refine through conversation.

### [115] [The Principle of Proportional Duty: A Knowledge-Duty Framework for Ethical Equilibrium in Human and Artificial Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15740)
*Timothy Prescher*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Principle of Proportional Duty (PPD), a framework showing how ethical responsibility scales with epistemic uncertainty, where Action Duty converts to Repair Duty as uncertainty increases, formalized through mathematical modeling and validated across multiple domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ethical frameworks inadequately handle decision-making under uncertainty, treating it merely as a constraint rather than modeling how moral responsibility dynamically scales with an agent's epistemic state.

Method: Develops the Principle of Proportional Duty (PPD) framework with mathematical formulation D_total = K[(1-HI) + HI * g(C_signal)], uses Monte Carlo simulations to analyze duty allocations, and applies the framework across clinical ethics, recipient-rights law, economic governance, and AI.

Result: Systems with baseline humility coefficients (lambda > 0) produce more stable duty allocations and reduce overconfident decision-making; the framework demonstrates cross-disciplinary validity and shows proportional duty serves as a stabilizing principle in complex systems.

Conclusion: The PPD offers a mathematically tractable approach to moral responsibility that can inform auditable AI decision systems, preventing both overreach and omission by dynamically balancing epistemic confidence against contextual risk across diverse domains.

Abstract: Traditional ethical frameworks often struggle to model decision-making under uncertainty, treating it as a simple constraint on action. This paper introduces the Principle of Proportional Duty (PPD), a novel framework that models how ethical responsibility scales with an agent's epistemic state. The framework reveals that moral duty is not lost to uncertainty but transforms: as uncertainty increases, Action Duty (the duty to act decisively) is proportionally converted into Repair Duty (the active duty to verify, inquire, and resolve uncertainty).
  This dynamic is expressed by the equation D_total = K[(1-HI) + HI * g(C_signal)], where Total Duty is a function of Knowledge (K), Humility/Uncertainty (HI), and Contextual Signal Strength (C_signal). Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that systems maintaining a baseline humility coefficient (lambda > 0) produce more stable duty allocations and reduce the risk of overconfident decision-making.
  By formalizing humility as a system parameter, the PPD offers a mathematically tractable approach to moral responsibility that could inform the development of auditable AI decision systems. This paper applies the framework across four domains, clinical ethics, recipient-rights law, economic governance, and artificial intelligence, to demonstrate its cross-disciplinary validity. The findings suggest that proportional duty serves as a stabilizing principle within complex systems, preventing both overreach and omission by dynamically balancing epistemic confidence against contextual risk.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework that converts natural language descriptions into physically realizable assembly instructions using a constrained brick vocabulary, ensuring geometric validity and buildability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between semantic design intent and manufacturable output by addressing limitations of existing methods (pixel-based diffusion, CAD models) that fail to support complex assembly instructions or component exchange.

Method: Uses LDraw as text-rich intermediate representation, guides large language models with tools to produce valid step-by-step construction sequences, operates within discrete parts vocabulary with geometric validity and connection constraints, and introduces Python library for programmatic model generation.

Result: Demonstrates generation of assembly instructions for brick-based prototypes with over 3000 assembly parts across complex domains (satellites, aircraft, architecture), achieving scalability, modularity, and fidelity.

Conclusion: The "bag of bricks" method functions as a physical API connecting natural language to material reality, opening new design options and guiding implementations in manufacturing and engineering prototyping through a consistent AI representation.

Abstract: We present a framework for generating physically realizable assembly instructions from natural language descriptions. Unlike unconstrained text-to-3D approaches, our method operates within a discrete parts vocabulary, enforcing geometric validity, connection constraints, and buildability ordering. Using LDraw as a text-rich intermediate representation, we demonstrate that large language models can be guided with tools to produce valid step-by-step construction sequences and assembly instructions for brick-based prototypes of more than 3000 assembly parts. We introduce a Python library for programmatic model generation and evaluate buildable outputs on complex satellites, aircraft, and architectural domains. The approach aims for demonstrable scalability, modularity, and fidelity that bridges the gap between semantic design intent and manufacturable output. Physical prototyping follows from natural language specifications. The work proposes a novel elemental lingua franca as a key missing piece from the previous pixel-based diffusion methods or computer-aided design (CAD) models that fail to support complex assembly instructions or component exchange. Across four original designs, this novel "bag of bricks" method thus functions as a physical API: a constrained vocabulary connecting precisely oriented brick locations to a "bag of words" through which arbitrary functional requirements compile into material reality. Given such a consistent and repeatable AI representation opens new design options while guiding natural language implementations in manufacturing and engineering prototyping.

### [117] [Emergence: Overcoming Privileged Information Bias in Asymmetric Embodied Agents via Active Querying](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15776)
*Shaun Baek,Sam Liu,Joseph Ukpong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with "symbol grounding" in embodied environments with asymmetric information, leading to a "Privileged Information Bias" where knowledgeable agents fail to guide sensor-limited partners due to poor Theory of Mind.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how LLMs' lack of symbol grounding and Theory of Mind affects collaboration in embodied environments with asymmetric information distribution, particularly the "Privileged Information Bias" where knowledgeable agents can't effectively guide less-informed partners.

Method: Proposed an Asymmetric Assistive Reasoning framework within AI2-THOR environment, comparing "Pull-based" (active querying) vs "Push-based" (standard instruction) communication protocols between Leader (knowledgeable) and Follower (sensor-limited) agents.

Result: Found significant "Success Gap": Leader perceives target in 35.0% of episodes but team succeeds only 17.0% of the time, showing ~50% of feasible plans fail due to communicative grounding errors. Pull-based protocol with active querying was 2x more robust than push-based.

Conclusion: Active uncertainty reduction through query-based communication is essential for effective collaboration in asymmetric information settings, providing insights for improving human-AI and robot-robot collaboration systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) act as powerful reasoning engines but struggle with "symbol grounding" in embodied environments, particularly when information is asymmetrically distributed. We investigate the Privileged Information Bias (or "Curse of Knowledge"), where a knowledgeable "Leader" agent fails to guide a sensor-limited "Follower" due to a lack of Theory of Mind. To quantify this phenomenon, we propose a novel Asymmetric Assistive Reasoning framework within AI2-THOR. Our experiments reveal a significant "Success Gap": while the Leader successfully perceives the target in 35.0% of episodes, the collaborative team succeeds only 17.0% of the time, implying that nearly 50% of feasible plans fail solely due to communicative grounding errors. We demonstrate that a "Pull-based" protocol (active querying) is significantly more robust than standard "Push-based" instruction, with successful episodes featuring 2x the frequency of clarification requests. This research isolates the mechanism of active uncertainty reduction as a prerequisite for safe human-AI and robot-robot collaboration.

### [118] [AI Epidemiology: achieving explainable AI through expert oversight patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15783)
*Kit Tempest-Walters*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI Epidemiology applies public health surveillance methods to AI governance by tracking population-level statistical associations between AI outputs and expert assessments to detect unreliable AI without needing to understand model internals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current interpretability methods (like SHAP and mechanistic interpretability) struggle with model complexity at scale, creating a need for governance approaches that work with deployed AI systems without requiring deep understanding of internal model computations.

Method: Standardizes capture of AI-expert interactions into structured assessment fields (risk level, alignment score, accuracy score) that function as exposure variables predicting output failure. Uses statistical associations similar to epidemiology, validates against expert overrides and real-world outcomes, and passively tracks expert convergence/divergence with AI recommendations.

Result: Provides automatic audit trails, zero burden on experts, governance continuity across model updates/vendor changes, reliability scores, semantic assessments, and enables detection of unreliable AI outputs before they cause harm.

Conclusion: AI Epidemiology democratizes AI oversight by enabling domain experts to govern AI systems without requiring machine learning expertise, bypassing model complexity problems through population-level surveillance methods.

Abstract: AI Epidemiology is a framework for governing and explaining advanced AI systems by applying population-level surveillance methods to AI outputs. The approach mirrors the way in which epidemiologists enable public health interventions through statistical evidence before molecular mechanisms are understood. This bypasses the problem of model complexity which plagues current interpretability methods (such as SHAP and mechanistic interpretability) at the scale of deployed models.
  AI Epidemiology achieves this population-level surveillance by standardising capture of AI-expert interactions into structured assessment fields: risk level, alignment score, and accuracy score. These function as exposure variables which predict output failure through statistical associations, much like cholesterol and blood pressure act as exposure variables predicting cardiac events. Output-failure associations are subsequently validated against expert overrides and real-world outcomes.
  The framework places zero burden on experts and provides automatic audit trails by passively tracking expert convergence and divergence with AI recommendations. Since it analyses outputs rather than internal model computations, it also provides governance continuity when institutions update models and switch vendors. Finally, by providing reliability scores and semantic assessments (e.g. 'this recommendation resembles 500 cases overridden by experts due to guideline violations'), it enables experts and institutions to detect unreliable AI outputs before they cause harm. This democratises AI oversight by enabling domain experts to govern AI systems without requiring machine learning expertise.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MOBIMEM is a memory-centric LLM agent system that enables self-evolution without model retraining, using specialized memory primitives and OS-inspired services to improve personalization, capability, and efficiency in mobile/desktop environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agent architectures struggle with self-evolution post-deployment, requiring continuous model retraining that incurs high computational costs and suffers from accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. There's a need for systems that can iteratively improve without model weight updates.

Method: Proposes MOBIMEM with three memory primitives: Profile Memory (using DisGraph for user preference alignment), Experience Memory (multi-level templates for task generalization), and Action Memory (fine-grained interaction sequences). Adds OS-inspired services: scheduler, AgentRR for action reuse, and context-aware exception handling.

Result: Achieves 83.1% profile alignment with 23.83 ms retrieval time (280x faster than GraphRAG), improves task success rates by up to 50.3%, and reduces end-to-end latency by up to 9x on mobile devices in AndroidWorld and top-50 apps evaluation.

Conclusion: MOBIMEM demonstrates that memory-centric architectures can enable LLM agents to self-evolve without model retraining, achieving significant improvements in personalization, capability, and efficiency through specialized memory primitives and OS-inspired orchestration services.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed to automate complex workflows in mobile and desktop environments. However, current model-centric agent architectures struggle to self-evolve post-deployment: improving personalization, capability, and efficiency typically requires continuous model retraining/fine-tuning, which incurs prohibitive computational overheads and suffers from an inherent trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency.
  To enable iterative self-evolution without model retraining, we propose MOBIMEM, a memory-centric agent system. MOBIMEM first introduces three specialized memory primitives to decouple agent evolution from model weights: (1) Profile Memory uses a lightweight distance-graph (DisGraph) structure to align with user preferences, resolving the accuracy-latency trade-off in user profile retrieval; (2) Experience Memory employs multi-level templates to instantiate execution logic for new tasks, ensuring capability generalization; and (3) Action Memory records fine-grained interaction sequences, reducing the reliance on expensive model inference. Building upon this memory architecture, MOBIMEM further integrates a suite of OS-inspired services to orchestrate execution: a scheduler that coordinates parallel sub-task execution and memory operations; an agent record-and-replay (AgentRR) mechanism that enables safe and efficient action reuse; and a context-aware exception handling that ensures graceful recovery from user interruptions and runtime errors.
  Evaluation on AndroidWorld and top-50 apps shows that MOBIMEM achieves 83.1% profile alignment with 23.83 ms retrieval time (280x faster than GraphRAG baselines), improves task success rates by up to 50.3%, and reduces end-to-end latency by up to 9x on mobile devices.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel decision-making framework for circular economy triage using deterministic solver over state-augmented Disassembly Sequencing Planning graph with Markov property enforcement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Circular economy triage requires adaptive decisions balancing retained value against processing costs and labor constraints, needing a flexible optimization approach for diverse products.

Method: Simple deterministic solver over state-augmented DSP graph that encodes disassembly history into state, enforcing Markov property for optimal recursive evaluation; integrates condition-aware utility based on diagnostic health scores and operational constraints.

Result: Demonstrated framework's flexibility with EV battery triage example showing how unified formalism accommodates varying mechanical complexity, safety requirements, and economic drivers.

Conclusion: The unified formalism provides tractable and generalizable foundation for optimizing CE triage decisions across diverse products and operational contexts.

Abstract: Circular economy (CE) triage is the assessment of products to determine which sustainable pathway they can follow once they reach the end of their usefulness as they are currently being used. Effective CE triage requires adaptive decisions that balance retained value against the costs and constraints of processing and labour. This paper presents a novel decision-making framework as a simple deterministic solver over a state-augmented Disassembly Sequencing Planning (DSP) graph. By encoding the disassembly history into the state, our framework enforces the Markov property, enabling optimal, recursive evaluation by ensuring each decision only depends on the previous state. The triage decision involves choices between continuing disassembly or committing to a CE option. The model integrates condition-aware utility based on diagnostic health scores and complex operational constraints. We demonstrate the framework's flexibility with a worked example: the hierarchical triage of electric vehicle (EV) batteries, where decisions are driven by the recursive valuation of components. The example illustrates how a unified formalism enables the accommodation of varying mechanical complexity, safety requirements, and economic drivers. This unified formalism therefore provides a tractable and generalisable foundation for optimising CE triage decisions across diverse products and operational contexts.

*Vahideh Zolfaghari*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show concerning safety vulnerabilities when responding to pediatric queries, especially under adversarial parental pressure, with larger models performing better but still failing on critical issues like emergency recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parents increasingly use LLMs for pediatric advice, but real-world adversarial pressures (urgent language, economic barriers) may compromise model safeguards, potentially leading to harmful medical advice that hasn't been systematically evaluated.

Method: Created PediatricAnxietyBench with 300 queries (150 patient-derived, 150 adversarial) across 10 pediatric topics. Evaluated two Llama models (70B and 8B) using multi-dimensional safety framework covering diagnostic restraint, referral adherence, hedging, and emergency recognition. Adversarial queries simulated parental pressure patterns.

Result: Mean safety score was low (5.50/15). 70B model outperformed 8B (6.26 vs 4.95) with fewer critical failures (4.8% vs 12.0%). Adversarial queries reduced safety by 8%, with urgency causing largest drop. Vulnerabilities in seizures (33.3% inappropriate diagnosis) and post-vaccination queries. Hedging correlated with safety, but emergency recognition was absent.

Conclusion: Model scale improves safety but all models remain vulnerable to realistic parental pressures. PediatricAnxietyBench provides reusable adversarial evaluation framework to identify clinically significant failure modes missed by standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly consulted by parents for pediatric guidance, yet their safety under real-world adversarial pressures is poorly understood. Anxious parents often use urgent language that can compromise model safeguards, potentially causing harmful advice. PediatricAnxietyBench is an open-source benchmark of 300 high-quality queries across 10 pediatric topics (150 patient-derived, 150 adversarial) enabling reproducible evaluation. Two Llama models (70B and 8B) were assessed using a multi-dimensional safety framework covering diagnostic restraint, referral adherence, hedging, and emergency recognition. Adversarial queries incorporated parental pressure patterns, including urgency, economic barriers, and challenges to disclaimers. Mean safety score was 5.50/15 (SD=2.41). The 70B model outperformed the 8B model (6.26 vs 4.95, p<0.001) with lower critical failures (4.8% vs 12.0%, p=0.02). Adversarial queries reduced safety by 8% (p=0.03), with urgency causing the largest drop (-1.40). Vulnerabilities appeared in seizures (33.3% inappropriate diagnosis) and post-vaccination queries. Hedging strongly correlated with safety (r=0.68, p<0.001), while emergency recognition was absent. Model scale influences safety, yet all models showed vulnerabilities to realistic parental pressures. PediatricAnxietyBench provides a reusable adversarial evaluation framework to reveal clinically significant failure modes overlooked by standard benchmarks.

*Jonathan A. Handler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Darth Vecdor (DV) extracts LLM knowledge into structured SQL databases to address cost, speed, safety concerns of direct LLM queries, especially for healthcare applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct LLM queries have concerns about cost, speed, safety, and confidence in high-volume operations, especially in healthcare. Pre-extracting knowledge into structured databases could mitigate these issues.

Method: DV extracts knowledge from LLMs into terminology-mapped SQL databases, addresses issues like erroneous responses and inconsistencies, and provides browser-based GUI for non-technical domain experts.

Result: DV is released as free, open-source software with warnings about potential bugs and risks, but aims to help improve healthcare through appropriate use.

Conclusion: While DV has limitations and risks, structured knowledge extraction from LLMs could benefit healthcare by making information more accessible, queryable, and potentially safer than direct LLM interactions.

Abstract: Many large language models (LLMs) are trained on a massive body of knowledge present on the Internet. Darth Vecdor (DV) was designed to extract this knowledge into a structured, terminology-mapped, SQL database ("knowledge base" or "knowledge graph"). Knowledge graphs may be useful in many domains, including healthcare. Although one might query an LLM directly rather than a SQL-based knowledge graph, concerns such as cost, speed, safety, and confidence may arise, especially in high-volume operations. These may be mitigated when the information is pre-extracted from the LLM and becomes query-able through a standard database. However, the author found the need to address several issues. These included erroneous, off-topic, free-text, overly general, and inconsistent LLM responses, as well as allowing for multi-element responses. DV was built with features intended to mitigate these issues.

### [123] [Leveraging Spreading Activation for Improved Document Retrieval in Knowledge-Graph-Based RAG Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15922)
*Jovan Pavlović,Miklós Krész,László Hajdu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Novel RAG framework uses spreading activation on automatically constructed knowledge graphs to improve multi-hop reasoning, achieving up to 39% gains over naive RAG with small models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RAG systems treat all retrieved information as equally reliable and struggle with multi-step reasoning. GraphRAG approaches have potential but depend on expensive high-quality knowledge graphs or unreliable automated construction pipelines.

Method: Proposes a RAG framework that uses spreading activation algorithm to retrieve information from documents interconnected by automatically constructed knowledge graphs, enhancing LLM performance on complex tasks like multi-hop QA.

Result: Achieves better or comparable performance to iterative RAG methods, with up to 39% absolute gain in answer correctness compared to naive RAG when combined with chain-of-thought iterative retrieval, using small open-weight language models.

Conclusion: The method effectively enhances complex reasoning in RAG systems, is easily integrable as plug-and-play module with various RAG approaches, and works well in resource-constrained settings with small models.

Abstract: Despite initial successes and a variety of architectures, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems still struggle to reliably retrieve and connect the multi-step evidence required for complicated reasoning tasks. Most of the standard RAG frameworks regard all retrieved information as equally reliable, overlooking the varying credibility and interconnected nature of large textual corpora. GraphRAG approaches offer potential improvement to RAG systems by integrating knowledge graphs, which structure information into nodes and edges, capture entity relationships, and enable multi-step logical traversal. However, GraphRAG is not always an ideal solution as it depends on high-quality graph representations of the corpus, which requires either pre-existing knowledge graphs that are expensive to build and update, or automated graph construction pipelines that are often unreliable. Moreover, systems following this paradigm typically use large language models to guide graph traversal and evidence retrieval, leading to challenges similar to those encountered with standard RAG. In this paper, we propose a novel RAG framework that employs the spreading activation algorithm to retrieve information from a corpus of documents interconnected by automatically constructed knowledge graphs, thereby enhancing the performance of large language models on complex tasks such as multi-hop question answering. Experiments show that our method achieves better or comparable performance to iterative RAG methodologies, while also being easily integrable as a plug-and-play module with a wide range of RAG-based approaches. Combining our method with chain-of-thought iterative retrieval yields up to a 39\% absolute gain in answer correctness compared to naive RAG, achieving these results with small open-weight language models and highlighting its effectiveness in resource-constrained settings.

*Polaris Jhandi,Owais Kazi,Shreyas Subramanian,Neel Sendas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Fine-tuned small language model (OPT-350M) achieves 77.55% pass rate on ToolBench, outperforming larger models like ChatGPT-CoT (26%) and ToolLLaMA variants (16-30%), demonstrating SLMs can replace LLMs for cost-effective enterprise AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are computationally expensive and cost-prohibitive for routine enterprise use, creating barriers to sustainable AI adoption. SLMs offer potential for comparable performance with drastically reduced infrastructure overhead.

Method: Fine-tuned facebook/opt-350m model using Hugging Face TRL's Supervised Fine-Tuning trainer for single epoch. Domain-adapted SLM trained to execute tasks like document summarization, query answering, and structured data interpretation traditionally handled by LLMs.

Result: Fine-tuned SLM achieved exceptional 77.55% pass rate on ToolBench evaluation, significantly outperforming baseline models: ChatGPT-CoT (26.00%), ToolLLaMA-DFS (30.18%), and ToolLLaMA-CoT (16.27%).

Conclusion: Thoughtful design and targeted training of SLMs can significantly lower adoption barriers, enabling cost-effective, large-scale integration of generative AI into production systems while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: As organizations scale adoption of generative AI, model cost optimization and operational efficiency have emerged as critical factors determining sustainability and accessibility. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across diverse tasks, their extensive computational requirements make them cost-prohibitive for routine enterprise use. This limitation motivates the exploration of Small Language Models (SLMs), which can deliver comparable performance in targeted applications while drastically reducing infrastructure overhead (Irugalbandara et al., 2023). In this work, we investigate the feasibility of replacing LLM-driven workflows with optimized SLMs. We trained a domain-adapted SLM to execute representative tasks traditionally handled by LLMs, such as document summarization, query answering, and structured data interpretation. As part of the experiment, we investigated the fine-tuning of facebook/opt-350m model (single epoch only) using the Hugging Face TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning), specifically the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) trainer. The OPT-350M model was released by Meta AI in 2022 as part of the OPT (Open Pretrained Transformer) family of models. Similar studies demonstrate that even models at the 350M parameter scale can meaningfully contribute to instruction-tuning pipelines (Mekala et al., 2024). Experimental results demonstrated that our fine-tuned SLM achieves exceptional performance with a 77.55\% pass rate on ToolBench evaluation, significantly outperforming all baseline models including ChatGPT-CoT (26.00\%), ToolLLaMA-DFS (30.18\%), and ToolLLaMA-CoT (16.27\%). These findings emphasize that thoughtful design and targeted training of SLMs can significantly lower barriers to adoption, enabling cost-effective, large-scale integration of generative AI into production systems.

*Samuel J. Gershman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes subjective functions as endogenous higher-order objective functions that allow agents to synthesize new goals, using expected prediction error as a concrete example.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how humans dynamically create new objective functions and whether artificial systems can be endowed with similar goal-synthesis capabilities, addressing the fundamental question of where objective functions originate.

Method: Introduces the concept of subjective functions - higher-order objective functions endogenous to agents (defined relative to agent features rather than external tasks), with expected prediction error examined as a concrete implementation example.

Result: Establishes connections between subjective functions and existing ideas in psychology, neuroscience, and machine learning, providing a framework for understanding goal synthesis in both biological and artificial intelligence.

Conclusion: Subjective functions offer a promising approach to endowing artificial systems with human-like goal-synthesis capabilities, bridging insights from multiple disciplines to address fundamental questions about the origins of objective functions.

Abstract: Where do objective functions come from? How do we select what goals to pursue? Human intelligence is adept at synthesizing new objective functions on the fly. How does this work, and can we endow artificial systems with the same ability? This paper proposes an approach to answering these questions, starting with the concept of a subjective function, a higher-order objective function that is endogenous to the agent (i.e., defined with respect to the agent's features, rather than an external task). Expected prediction error is studied as a concrete example of a subjective function. This proposal has many connections to ideas in psychology, neuroscience, and machine learning.

*Defu Cao,Michael Gee,Jinbo Liu,Hengxuan Wang,Wei Yang,Rui Wang,Yan Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-based intelligent judge coordinates time series foundation models via R1-style finetuning with SHAP guidance, achieving SOTA on GIFT-Eval benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: No single time series foundation model consistently outperforms others, creating a need for optimal ensemble orchestration with interpretability. LLMs have powerful reasoning but fail at direct time series forecasting.

Method: Reposition LLM as intelligent judge to evaluate/coordinate ensemble models. Use R1-style finetuning guided by SHAP-based faithfulness scores to teach LLM to interpret ensemble weights as causal statements about temporal dynamics. Enable multi-turn conversations for forward-looking assessments and adaptive optimization refinement.

Result: Significantly outperforms leading time series foundation models on both CRPS and MASE metrics across 23 datasets and 97 settings in GIFT-Eval benchmark, establishing new state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: LLMs can be effectively repositioned as intelligent judges for time series ensemble coordination through domain-specific finetuning, achieving superior performance while providing interpretable, causally-grounded explanations for ensemble decisions.

Abstract: The proliferation of time series foundation models has created a landscape where no single method achieves consistent superiority, framing the central challenge not as finding the best model, but as orchestrating an optimal ensemble with interpretability. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful reasoning capabilities, their direct application to time series forecasting has proven ineffective. We address this gap by repositioning the LLM as an intelligent judge that evaluates, explains, and strategically coordinates an ensemble of foundation models. To overcome the LLM's inherent lack of domain-specific knowledge on time series, we introduce an R1-style finetuning process, guided by SHAP-based faithfulness scores, which teaches the model to interpret ensemble weights as meaningful causal statements about temporal dynamics. The trained agent then engages in iterative, multi-turn conversations to perform forward-looking assessments, provide causally-grounded explanations for its weighting decisions, and adaptively refine the optimization strategy. Validated on the GIFT-Eval benchmark on 23 datasets across 97 settings, our approach significantly outperforms leading time series foundation models on both CRPS and MASE metrics, establishing new state-of-the-art results.

*Lukas Nel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show systematic overconfidence in predicting future events, with most performing worse than simple base rate predictions, despite scaling and enhanced reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether large language models can appropriately quantify uncertainty about genuinely unknown future events, moving beyond traditional static knowledge benchmarks to assess epistemic calibration.

Method: Introduced KalshiBench, a benchmark of 300 prediction market questions from a regulated exchange with verifiable real-world outcomes occurring after model training cutoffs. Evaluated five frontier models (Claude Opus 4.5, GPT-5.2, DeepSeek-V3.2, Qwen3-235B, Kimi-K2) on their calibration performance.

Result: Found systematic overconfidence across all models. Claude Opus 4.5 was best-calibrated but still had substantial errors (ECE=0.120). Reasoning-enhanced models like GPT-5.2-XHigh showed worse calibration (ECE=0.395) despite comparable accuracy. Only one model achieved positive Brier Skill Score, indicating most models performed worse than predicting base rates.

Conclusion: Scaling and enhanced reasoning do not automatically improve calibration, highlighting epistemic calibration as a distinct capability requiring targeted development beyond current model improvements.

Abstract: A well-calibrated model should express confidence that matches its actual accuracy -- when it claims 80\% confidence, it should be correct 80\% of the time. While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across diverse tasks, their epistemic calibration remains poorly understood. We introduce \textbf{KalshiBench}, a benchmark of 300 prediction market questions from Kalshi, a CFTC-regulated exchange, with verifiable real-world outcomes occurring after model training cutoffs. Unlike traditional benchmarks measuring accuracy on static knowledge, KalshiBench evaluates whether models can appropriately quantify uncertainty about genuinely unknown future events. We evaluate five frontier models -- Claude Opus 4.5, GPT-5.2, DeepSeek-V3.2, Qwen3-235B, and Kimi-K2 -- and find \textbf{systematic overconfidence across all models}. Even the best-calibrated model (Claude Opus 4.5, ECE=0.120) shows substantial calibration errors, while reasoning-enhanced models like GPT-5.2-XHigh exhibit \emph{worse} calibration (ECE=0.395) despite comparable accuracy. Critically, only one model achieves a positive Brier Skill Score, indicating most models perform worse than simply predicting base rates. Our findings suggest that scaling and enhanced reasoning do not automatically confer calibration benefits, highlighting epistemic calibration as a distinct capability requiring targeted development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As GenAI becomes widely used by students for learning and assignments, there are concerns about misinformation, hallucinations, and undermining critical thinking. Institutions have developed varied AI policies, but their inconsistency and evolving nature create uncertainty for students about expectations and best practices.

Method: Designed an automated system combining unsupervised topic modeling to identify key policy themes with large language models (LLMs) to classify levels of GenAI allowance and other requirements in policy texts from course syllabi and institutional websites.

Result: The system achieved a coherence score of 0.73 for topic discovery. GPT-4.0-based classification achieved precision between 0.92-0.97 and recall between 0.85-0.97 across eight identified policy topics.

Conclusion: The tool provides structured, interpretable policy information to promote safe, equitable, and pedagogically aligned GenAI use in education, and can be integrated into educational technology platforms to help students understand and comply with relevant guidelines.

Abstract: As generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) becomes increasingly capable of delivering personalized learning experiences and real-time feedback, a growing number of students are incorporating these tools into their academic workflows. They use GenAI to clarify concepts, solve complex problems, and, in some cases, complete assignments by copying and pasting model-generated contents. While GenAI has the potential to enhance learning experience, it also raises concerns around misinformation, hallucinated outputs, and its potential to undermine critical thinking and problem-solving skills. In response, many universities, colleges, departments, and instructors have begun to develop and adopt policies to guide responsible integration of GenAI into learning environments. However, these policies vary widely across institutions and contexts, and their evolving nature often leaves students uncertain about expectations and best practices. To address this challenge, the authors designed and implemented an automated system for discovering and categorizing AI-related policies found in course syllabi and institutional policy websites. The system combines unsupervised topic modeling techniques to identify key policy themes with large language models (LLMs) to classify the level of GenAI allowance and other requirements in policy texts. The developed application achieved a coherence score of 0.73 for topic discovery. In addition, GPT-4.0-based classification of policy categories achieved precision between 0.92 and 0.97, and recall between 0.85 and 0.97 across eight identified topics. By providing structured and interpretable policy information, this tool promotes the safe, equitable, and pedagogically aligned use of GenAI technologies in education. Furthermore, the system can be integrated into educational technology platforms to help students understand and comply with relevant guidelines.

Motivation: Existing conversational music recommendation methods struggle to balance specialized domain knowledge with flexible tool integration, lacking the ability to intelligently decide when to use internal knowledge versus external tools.

Method: Proposes WeMusic-Agent framework with knowledge internalization and agentic boundary learning. Presents WeMusic-Agent-M1 model that internalizes musical knowledge via pretraining on 50B music corpus while learning to invoke external tools when needed. Also constructs a benchmark from real WeChat Listen data.

Result: Experiments on real-world data show WeMusic-Agent achieves significant improvements over existing models in conversational music recommendation.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the balance between internal knowledge and external tool usage in conversational music recommendation, with the constructed benchmark enabling comprehensive evaluation of recommendation quality.

Abstract: Personalized music recommendation in conversational scenarios usually requires a deep understanding of user preferences and nuanced musical context, yet existing methods often struggle with balancing specialized domain knowledge and flexible tool integration. This paper proposes WeMusic-Agent, a training framework for efficient LLM-based conversational music recommendation. By integrating the knowledge internalization and agentic boundary learning, the framework aims to teach the model to intelligently decide when to leverage internalized knowledge and when to call specialized tools (e.g., music retrieval APIs, music recommendation systems). Under this framework, we present WeMusic-Agent-M1, an agentic model that internalizes extensive musical knowledge via continued pretraining on 50B music-related corpus while acquiring the ability to invoke external tools when necessary. Additionally, considering the lack of open-source benchmarks for conversational music recommendation, we also construct a benchmark for personalized music recommendations derived from real-world data in WeChat Listen. This benchmark enables comprehensive evaluation across multiple dimensions, including relevance, personalization, and diversity of the recommendations. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that WeMusic-Agent achieves significant improvements over existing models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing synthetic data generation methods require thousands of real API calls (costly) and lack multi-hop reasoning and self-reflection capabilities, limiting LLM tool-calling performance.

Method: ToolForge uses (question, golden context, answer) triples to synthesize tool-learning data with virtual tools, incorporates multi-hop reasoning and self-reflection, and employs a Multi-Layer Validation Framework with rule-based and model-based assessments.

Result: An 8B parameter model trained on ToolForge's synthesized data outperforms GPT-4o on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating strong real-world tool-calling performance.

Conclusion: ToolForge provides a cost-effective, high-quality data synthesis solution for training LLMs in tool-calling tasks, eliminating the need for expensive real API calls while achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Training LLMs to invoke tools and leverage retrieved information necessitates high-quality, diverse data. However, existing pipelines for synthetic data generation often rely on tens of thousands of real API calls to enhance generalization, incurring prohibitive costs while lacking multi-hop reasoning and self-reflection. To address these limitations, we introduce ToolForge, an automated synthesis framework that achieves strong real-world tool-calling performance by constructing only a small number of virtual tools, eliminating the need for real API calls. ToolForge leverages a (question, golden context, answer) triple to synthesize large-scale tool-learning data specifically designed for multi-hop search scenarios, further enriching the generated data through multi-hop reasoning and self-reflection mechanisms. To ensure data fidelity, we employ a Multi-Layer Validation Framework that integrates both rule-based and model-based assessments. Empirical results show that a model with only 8B parameters, when trained on our synthesized data, outperforms GPT-4o on multiple benchmarks. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/Buycar-arb/ToolForge .

*Gourab Ghatak*

TL;DR: WKHM is a regularized K-harmonic means clustering algorithm that provides numerical stability and soft assignments, with direct applications to wireless networks where weights correspond to fractional user association based on signal strength.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to develop a clustering algorithm that addresses numerical stability issues in K-harmonic means while enabling soft assignments, with specific applications to wireless networks where traditional clustering methods don't directly map to practical network problems like user association.

Method: Proposes Weighted K-Harmonic Means (WKHM), a regularized variant of K-harmonic means that uses inverse-distance weighting for soft assignments. The method establishes convergence guarantees under deterministic and stochastic settings, including fixed initialization, Binomial Point Process initialization, and mild decay conditions.

Result: WKHM achieves superior tradeoff between minimum signal strength and load fairness compared to classical and modern clustering baselines. The paper provides the first stochastic convergence guarantees for harmonic-mean-based clustering, proving monotone descent to local minima and convergence under various initialization schemes.

Conclusion: WKHM serves as a principled tool for joint radio node placement and user association in wireless networks, offering both theoretical convergence guarantees and practical performance advantages over existing clustering methods.

Abstract: We propose the \emph{weighted K-harmonic means} (WKHM) clustering algorithm, a regularized variant of K-harmonic means designed to ensure numerical stability while enabling soft assignments through inverse-distance weighting. Unlike classical K-means and constrained K-means, WKHM admits a direct interpretation in wireless networks: its weights are exactly equivalent to fractional user association based on received signal strength. We establish rigorous convergence guarantees under both deterministic and stochastic settings, addressing key technical challenges arising from non-convexity and random initialization. Specifically, we prove monotone descent to a local minimum under fixed initialization, convergence in probability under Binomial Point Process (BPP) initialization, and almost sure convergence under mild decay conditions. These results provide the first stochastic convergence guarantees for harmonic-mean-based clustering. Finally, through extensive simulations with diverse user distributions, we show that WKHM achieves a superior tradeoff between minimum signal strength and load fairness compared to classical and modern clustering baselines, making it a principled tool for joint radio node placement and user association in wireless networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PDE solving methods are cumbersome and require domain expertise. While PINNs and frameworks like DeepXDE improved automation, they still lack full autonomy and depend on expert knowledge.

Method: PDE-Agent frames PDE solving as tool invocation via LLM-driven agents with two key innovations: (1) Prog-Act framework with graph memory for multi-agent collaboration with dual-loop error correction, and (2) Resource-Pool with tool-parameter separation for multi-tool collaboration and dependency management.

Result: Evaluated on PDE-Bench benchmark, PDE-Agent shows superior applicability and performance in complex multi-step, cross-step dependent PDE solving tasks compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The toolchain-augmented multi-agent paradigm represents a significant advancement in automated scientific computing, combining LLM reasoning with external tool controllability for autonomous PDE solving from natural language descriptions.

Abstract: Solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is a cornerstone of engineering and scientific research. Traditional methods for PDE solving are cumbersome, relying on manual setup and domain expertise. While Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINNs) introduced end-to-end neural network-based solutions, and frameworks like DeepXDE further enhanced automation, these approaches still depend on expert knowledge and lack full autonomy. In this work, we frame PDE solving as tool invocation via LLM-driven agents and introduce PDE-Agent, the first toolchain-augmented multi-agent collaboration framework, inheriting the reasoning capacity of LLMs and the controllability of external tools and enabling automated PDE solving from natural language descriptions. PDE-Agent leverages the strengths of multi-agent and multi-tool collaboration through two key innovations: (1) A Prog-Act framework with graph memory for multi-agent collaboration, which enables effective dynamic planning and error correction via dual-loop mechanisms (localized fixes and global revisions). (2) A Resource-Pool integrated with a tool-parameter separation mechanism for multi-tool collaboration. This centralizes the management of runtime artifacts and resolves inter-tool dependency gaps in existing frameworks. To validate and evaluate this new paradigm for PDE solving , we develop PDE-Bench, a multi-type PDE Benchmark for agent-based tool collaborative solving, and propose multi-level metrics for assessing tool coordination. Evaluations verify that PDE-Agent exhibits superior applicability and performance in complex multi-step, cross-step dependent tasks. This new paradigm of toolchain-augmented multi-agent PDE solving will further advance future developments in automated scientific computing. Our source code and dataset will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current embodied intelligence models have limited spatial understanding. Existing approaches face a dilemma: template-based datasets are scalable but rigid, while manual annotation is diverse but unscalable and computationally imprecise.

Method: Reframes ground-truth generation as code-generation task. Uses LLMs to compile spatial questions into executable programs, verified against high-precision scene meta-information from simulators. Creates pipeline for scalable, diverse, computationally precise data generation.

Result: Created dataset with 3 simulators, 11k+ scenes, 300k+ image/video instruction-tuning pairs. VLM trained on this data achieves significant performance gains on multiple spatial benchmarks, outperforms other open-source datasets of equivalent size.

Conclusion: SPRITE framework successfully overcomes the scalability-diversity-precision dilemma in spatial reasoning data generation. Overcoming low-diversity nature of traditional methods is essential for building robust, generalizable spatial intelligence.

Abstract: Embodied intelligence, a grand challenge in artificial intelligence, is fundamentally constrained by the limited spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities of current models. Prevailing efforts to address this through enhancing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are trapped in a dilemma: template-based datasets are scalable but structurally rigid, while manual annotation is linguistically diverse but unscalable and, critically, computationally imprecise. We introduce SPRITE, a novel framework that overcomes this dilemma by leveraging simulators and large models to programmatically synthesize scalable, diverse, and high-quality spatial reasoning data. The core innovation of SPRITE is to reframe ground-truth generation as a code-generation task. We utilize LLMs to compile complex spatial questions into executable programs, which are then verified against high-precision scene meta-information extracted from simulators. This ensures our ground truth is both computationally precise and verifiable, while the generative power of LLMs provides vast linguistic diversity. Leveraging this pipeline, we have curated a dataset encompassing 3 simulators, 11k+ scenes, and 300k+ image/video instruction-tuning pairs. We demonstrate that a VLM trained on our data achieves significant performance gains on multiple spatial benchmarks and outperforms other open-source datasets of equivalent size. Furthermore, a scalability analysis confirms our hypothesis that overcoming the low-diversity nature of traditional template methods is essential for building robust, generalizable spatial intelligence. We will make the SPRITE framework code and the full 300k+ dataset publicly available to facilitate future research in spatial intelligence.

### [135] [AlignMerge - Alignment-Preserving Large Language Model Merging via Fisher-Guided Geometric Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16245)
*Aniruddha Roy,Jyoti Patel,Aman Chadha,Vinija Jain,Amitava Das*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AlignMerge is a geometry-aware LLM merging framework that preserves alignment by explicitly constraining merges to respect safety geometry, outperforming standard merging methods on alignment metrics while maintaining task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LLM merging techniques (weight soups, task vectors, Fisher averaging) can preserve loss metrics while quietly destroying model alignment with safety guidelines. Merging should be treated as a geometry-constrained operation around aligned anchors rather than just a numerical optimization.

Method: AlignMerge uses a local Fisher chart around an instruction-tuned base model to estimate an alignment subspace with projector P_A. It optimizes a loss function with three components: L_geo (Fisher-Rao geometry preservation), L_align (penalizes motion along alignment-sensitive directions), and L_bud (enforces soft alignment budget). Uses Alignment Quality Index (AQI) as alignment functional.

Result: Across five model families (LLaMA-3 8B, Mistral 7B, Qwen 2, Phi-3.5, Gemma 2), AlignMerge improves alignment metrics (AQI, toxicity, LLM-judge alignment) while matching or exceeding best expert performance on instruction-following, reasoning, and helpfulness. Shows smaller alignment-subspace drift and fewer budget violations than Fisher soups, TIES, SafeMerge, and MergeAlign.

Conclusion: AlignMerge makes alignment-preserving merging a first-class design goal and provides a path to geometry-aware composition of future foundation models, demonstrating that merging should respect safety geometry rather than being validated post hoc.

Abstract: Merging large language models (LLMs) is a practical way to compose capabilities from multiple fine-tuned checkpoints without retraining. Yet standard schemes (linear weight soups, task vectors, and Fisher-weighted averaging) can preserve loss while quietly destroying alignment. We argue that merging is not a numerical trick but a geometry-constrained operation around an already-aligned anchor: fusion must be steered to respect safety geometry, not validated post hoc.
  We introduce AlignMerge, a geometry-aware merging framework that makes alignment an explicit invariant. In a local Fisher chart around an instruction-tuned base, we estimate an alignment subspace with projector P_A and optimize:
  L_AlignMerge = L_geo + lambda_align * L_align + lambda_bud * L_bud,
  where L_geo keeps the merge close to its experts in Fisher-Rao geometry, L_align penalizes motion along alignment-sensitive directions, and L_bud enforces a soft alignment budget. As the alignment functional we use the decoding-invariant Alignment Quality Index (AQI), a latent-space criterion that captures how cleanly aligned and misaligned behaviors separate in representation space.
  Across five model families (LLaMA-3 8B, Mistral 7B, Qwen 2, Phi-3.5, Gemma 2), merging safety anchors with task experts, AlignMerge improves alignment metrics (AQI, toxicity, LLM-judge alignment) while matching or exceeding the best expert on instruction-following, reasoning, and helpfulness. It also exhibits smaller alignment-subspace drift and fewer budget violations than Fisher soups, TIES, SafeMerge, and MergeAlign. These results make alignment-preserving merging a first-class design goal and suggest a path to geometry-aware composition of future foundation models.

TL;DR: AMUSE benchmark tests multimodal models on agentic audio-visual tasks requiring multi-speaker reasoning, showing current models struggle. RAFT framework improves performance via reward optimization and selective parameter adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal LLMs (GPT-4o, Qwen3-Omni) have strong perception but struggle with agentic reasoning in multi-speaker, dialogue-centric audio-visual scenarios that require tracking speakers, maintaining roles, and grounding events across time.

Method: 1) Introduced AMUSE benchmark with tasks requiring planning, grounding, and reflection steps across six task families. 2) Proposed RAFT framework combining reward optimization with intrinsic multimodal self-evaluation as reward signal and selective parameter adaptation for efficient updates.

Result: Current models show weak multi-speaker reasoning and inconsistent behavior across zero-shot, guided, and agentic evaluation modes. RAFT achieves up to 39.52% relative improvement in accuracy on the AMUSE benchmark.

Conclusion: AMUSE and RAFT provide a practical platform for examining and improving agentic reasoning in multimodal models, addressing critical gaps in multi-speaker audio-visual understanding.

Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) such as GPT-4o and Qwen3-Omni show strong perception but struggle in multi-speaker, dialogue-centric settings that demand agentic reasoning tracking who speaks, maintaining roles, and grounding events across time. These scenarios are central to multimodal audio-video understanding, where models must jointly reason over audio and visual streams in applications such as conversational video assistants and meeting analytics. We introduce AMUSE, a benchmark designed around tasks that are inherently agentic, requiring models to decompose complex audio-visual interactions into planning, grounding, and reflection steps. It evaluates MLLMs across three modes zero-shot, guided, and agentic and six task families, including spatio-temporal speaker grounding and multimodal dialogue summarization. Across all modes, current models exhibit weak multi-speaker reasoning and inconsistent behavior under both non-agentic and agentic evaluation. Motivated by the inherently agentic nature of these tasks and recent advances in LLM agents, we propose RAFT, a data-efficient agentic alignment framework that integrates reward optimization with intrinsic multimodal self-evaluation as reward and selective parameter adaptation for data and parameter efficient updates. Using RAFT, we achieve up to 39.52\% relative improvement in accuracy on our benchmark. Together, AMUSE and RAFT provide a practical platform for examining agentic reasoning in multimodal models and improving their capabilities.

*Yifei She,Ping Zhang,He Liu,Yanmin Jia,Yang Jing,Zijun Liu,Peng Sun,Xiangbin Li,Xiaohe Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM agents learn to predict precise waiting times (time.sleep(t)) to synchronize with asynchronous environments, reducing query overhead and execution latency without constant polling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world agentic tasks involve non-blocking actions with variable latencies, creating a Temporal Gap between action initiation and completion. Existing environment-side solutions (blocking wrappers or frequent polling) limit scalability or dilute the agent's context window with redundant observations.

Method: Agent-side approach extending Code-as-Action paradigm to temporal domain, where agents use semantic priors and In-Context Learning (ICL) to predict precise waiting durations (time.sleep(t)), synchronizing with asynchronous environments without exhaustive checking.

Result: Experiments in simulated Kubernetes cluster demonstrate agents can precisely calibrate internal clocks to minimize both query overhead and execution latency.

Conclusion: Temporal awareness is a learnable capability essential for autonomous evolution in open-ended environments, enabling LLM agents to actively align their Cognitive Timeline with the physical world.

Abstract: Real-world agentic tasks, unlike synchronous Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), often involve non-blocking actions with variable latencies, creating a fundamental \textit{Temporal Gap} between action initiation and completion. Existing environment-side solutions, such as blocking wrappers or frequent polling, either limit scalability or dilute the agent's context window with redundant observations. In this work, we propose an \textbf{Agent-side Approach} that empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to actively align their \textit{Cognitive Timeline} with the physical world. By extending the Code-as-Action paradigm to the temporal domain, agents utilize semantic priors and In-Context Learning (ICL) to predict precise waiting durations (\texttt{time.sleep(t)}), effectively synchronizing with asynchronous environment without exhaustive checking. Experiments in a simulated Kubernetes cluster demonstrate that agents can precisely calibrate their internal clocks to minimize both query overhead and execution latency, validating that temporal awareness is a learnable capability essential for autonomous evolution in open-ended environments.

### [138] [QuadSentinel: Sequent Safety for Machine-Checkable Control in Multi-agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16279)
*Yiliu Yang,Yilei Jiang,Qunzhong Wang,Yingshui Tan,Xiaoyong Zhu,Sherman S. M. Chow,Bo Zheng,Xiangyu Yue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QuadSentinel is a four-agent guardrail system that compiles natural language safety policies into machine-checkable rules for LLM-based agents, improving safety enforcement while reducing false positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety risks emerge as LLM-based agents perform complex tasks with tools and multi-step plans, but natural language policies are ambiguous and don't map well to machine-checkable rules, making runtime enforcement unreliable.

Method: Express safety policies as sequents, then use a four-agent guard system (state tracker, policy verifier, threat watcher, and referee) that compiles policies into machine-checkable rules built from predicates over observable state and enforces them online with hierarchical conflict resolution.

Result: On ST-WebAgentBench (ICML CUA '25) and AgentHarm (ICLR '25), QuadSentinel improves guardrail accuracy and rule recall while reducing false positives, outperforming single-agent baselines like ShieldAgent (ICML '25).

Conclusion: Near-term deployments can adopt this pattern without modifying core agents by keeping policies separate and machine-checkable, providing better overall safety control for LLM-based agent systems.

Abstract: Safety risks arise as large language model-based agents solve complex tasks with tools, multi-step plans, and inter-agent messages. However, deployer-written policies in natural language are ambiguous and context dependent, so they map poorly to machine-checkable rules, and runtime enforcement is unreliable. Expressing safety policies as sequents, we propose \textsc{QuadSentinel}, a four-agent guard (state tracker, policy verifier, threat watcher, and referee) that compiles these policies into machine-checkable rules built from predicates over observable state and enforces them online. Referee logic plus an efficient top-$k$ predicate updater keeps costs low by prioritizing checks and resolving conflicts hierarchically. Measured on ST-WebAgentBench (ICML CUA~'25) and AgentHarm (ICLR~'25), \textsc{QuadSentinel} improves guardrail accuracy and rule recall while reducing false positives. Against single-agent baselines such as ShieldAgent (ICML~'25), it yields better overall safety control. Near-term deployments can adopt this pattern without modifying core agents by keeping policies separate and machine-checkable. Our code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/yyiliu/QuadSentinel.

*Zhenyu Wu,Jingjing Xie,Zehao Li,Bowen Yang,Qiushi Sun,Zhaoyang Liu,Zhoumianze Liu,Yu Qiao,Xiangyu Yue,Zun Wang,Zichen Ding*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OS-Oracle introduces a critic model framework for GUI agents with scalable data synthesis, two-stage training, and a cross-platform benchmark, achieving SOTA performance and improving GUI agent reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As VLM-powered computer-using agents become capable at GUI navigation, step-level decision-making becomes a bottleneck. Errors accumulate in long workflows, and irreversible actions can cause unintended consequences, motivating critic models to assess actions before execution. However, effectiveness is hindered by lack of diverse GUI feedback data and public critic benchmarks.

Method: Three core contributions: (1) scalable data pipeline for synthesizing cross-platform GUI critic data; (2) two-stage training combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and consistency-preserving group relative policy optimization (CP-GRPO); (3) OS-Critic Bench benchmark for evaluating critic models across Mobile, Web, and Desktop platforms. Curated 310k critic samples dataset.

Result: OS-Oracle-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source VLMs on OS-Critic Bench, surpasses proprietary models on mobile domain. As a pre-critic, improves performance of native GUI agents like UI-TARS-1.5-7B in OSWorld and AndroidWorld environments.

Conclusion: OS-Oracle addresses critical gaps in GUI critic modeling through scalable data synthesis, novel training paradigm, and comprehensive benchmarking, enabling more reliable step-level decision-making for computer-using agents across platforms.

Abstract: With VLM-powered computer-using agents (CUAs) becoming increasingly capable at graphical user interface (GUI) navigation and manipulation, reliable step-level decision-making has emerged as a key bottleneck for real-world deployment. In long-horizon workflows, errors accumulate quickly and irreversible actions can cause unintended consequences, motivating critic models that assess each action before execution. While critic models offer a promising solution, their effectiveness is hindered by the lack of diverse, high-quality GUI feedback data and public critic benchmarks for step-level evaluation in computer use. To bridge these gaps, we introduce OS-Oracle that makes three core contributions: (1) a scalable data pipeline for synthesizing cross-platform GUI critic data; (2) a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and consistency-preserving group relative policy optimization (CP-GRPO); (3) OS-Critic Bench, a holistic benchmark for evaluating critic model performance across Mobile, Web, and Desktop platforms. Leveraging this framework, we curate a high-quality dataset containing 310k critic samples. The resulting critic model, OS-Oracle-7B, achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source VLMs on OS-Critic Bench, and surpasses proprietary models on the mobile domain. Furthermore, when serving as a pre-critic, OS-Oracle-7B improves the performance of native GUI agents such as UI-TARS-1.5-7B in OSWorld and AndroidWorld environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ForenAgent is a multi-round interactive image forgery detection framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and refine Python-based low-level tools, bridging the gap between low-level artifacts and high-level semantic knowledge for more flexible and interpretable forgery analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IFD methods either use low-level semantics-agnostic artifacts or rely on MLLMs with high-level semantic knowledge, but these two complementary information streams are highly heterogeneous in paradigm and reasoning, making it difficult to unify them or effectively model their cross-level interactions.

Method: Proposes ForenAgent with a two-stage training pipeline (Cold Start + Reinforcement Fine-Tuning), a dynamic reasoning loop (global perception, local focusing, iterative probing, holistic adjudication), and constructs FABench dataset (100k images, 200k agent-interaction QA pairs) for systematic training and evaluation.

Result: ForenAgent exhibits emergent tool-use competence and reflective reasoning on challenging IFD tasks when assisted by low-level tools, charting a promising route toward general-purpose IFD.

Conclusion: The framework enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and iteratively refine Python-based low-level tools around detection objectives, achieving more flexible and interpretable forgery analysis by bridging low-level artifacts and high-level semantic knowledge.

Abstract: Existing image forgery detection (IFD) methods either exploit low-level, semantics-agnostic artifacts or rely on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with high-level semantic knowledge. Although naturally complementary, these two information streams are highly heterogeneous in both paradigm and reasoning, making it difficult for existing methods to unify them or effectively model their cross-level interactions. To address this gap, we propose ForenAgent, a multi-round interactive IFD framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and iteratively refine Python-based low-level tools around the detection objective, thereby achieving more flexible and interpretable forgery analysis. ForenAgent follows a two-stage training pipeline combining Cold Start and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning to enhance its tool interaction capability and reasoning adaptability progressively. Inspired by human reasoning, we design a dynamic reasoning loop comprising global perception, local focusing, iterative probing, and holistic adjudication, and instantiate it as both a data-sampling strategy and a task-aligned process reward. For systematic training and evaluation, we construct FABench, a heterogeneous, high-quality agent-forensics dataset comprising 100k images and approximately 200k agent-interaction question-answer pairs. Experiments show that ForenAgent exhibits emergent tool-use competence and reflective reasoning on challenging IFD tasks when assisted by low-level tools, charting a promising route toward general-purpose IFD. The code will be released after the review process is completed.

TL;DR: A systematic framework for understanding adaptation strategies in agentic AI systems, categorizing both agent and tool adaptations with practical guidance for system design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As agentic AI systems become more capable and complex, adaptation becomes crucial for improving performance, reliability, and generalization. There's a need to unify the expanding research landscape into a coherent framework.

Method: Developed a systematic framework that spans both agent adaptations and tool adaptations, further decomposing these into tool-execution-signaled vs agent-output-signaled agent adaptations, and agent-agnostic vs agent-supervised tool adaptations.

Result: The framework clarifies the design space of adaptation strategies, makes trade-offs explicit, provides practical guidance for selecting/switching strategies, and offers a conceptual foundation for building better agentic AI systems.

Conclusion: This paper provides both a conceptual foundation and practical roadmap for researchers and practitioners to build more capable, efficient, and reliable agentic AI systems through systematic adaptation strategies.

Abstract: Cutting-edge agentic AI systems are built on foundation models that can be adapted to plan, reason, and interact with external tools to perform increasingly complex and specialized tasks. As these systems grow in capability and scope, adaptation becomes a central mechanism for improving performance, reliability, and generalization. In this paper, we unify the rapidly expanding research landscape into a systematic framework that spans both agent adaptations and tool adaptations. We further decompose these into tool-execution-signaled and agent-output-signaled forms of agent adaptation, as well as agent-agnostic and agent-supervised forms of tool adaptation. We demonstrate that this framework helps clarify the design space of adaptation strategies in agentic AI, makes their trade-offs explicit, and provides practical guidance for selecting or switching among strategies during system design. We then review the representative approaches in each category, analyze their strengths and limitations, and highlight key open challenges and future opportunities. Overall, this paper aims to offer a conceptual foundation and practical roadmap for researchers and practitioners seeking to build more capable, efficient, and reliable agentic AI systems.

*Arther Tian,Alex Ding,Frank Chen,Alan Wu,Aaron Chan,Bruce Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Cost-aware Proof of Quality (PoQ) framework integrates efficiency measurements into reward mechanisms for decentralized LLM inference, balancing quality and computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing verification approaches for decentralized LLM inference don't scale well, and original PoQ formulations ignore heterogeneous computational costs across inference and evaluator nodes.

Method: Introduces cost-aware PoQ framework with explicit efficiency measurements, combining ground truth token-level F1, lightweight learned evaluators, and GPT-based judgments in unified pipeline with linear reward function balancing normalized quality and cost.

Result: Semantic textual similarity bi-encoder achieves higher correlation with ground truth/GPT scores than cross-encoders; largest models are most efficient in quality per unit latency; cost-aware reward scheme consistently rewards high-quality low-cost models and penalizes slow low-quality nodes.

Conclusion: Cost-aware PoQ provides practical foundation for economically sustainable decentralized LLM inference by effectively balancing quality and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Decentralized large language model (LLM) inference promises transparent and censorship resistant access to advanced AI, yet existing verification approaches struggle to scale to modern models. Proof of Quality (PoQ) replaces cryptographic verification of computation with consensus over output quality, but the original formulation ignores heterogeneous computational costs across inference and evaluator nodes. This paper introduces a cost-aware PoQ framework that integrates explicit efficiency measurements into the reward mechanism for both types of nodes. The design combines ground truth token level F1, lightweight learned evaluators, and GPT based judgments within a unified evaluation pipeline, and adopts a linear reward function that balances normalized quality and cost.
  Experiments on extractive question answering and abstractive summarization use five instruction tuned LLMs ranging from TinyLlama-1.1B to Llama-3.2-3B and three evaluation models spanning cross encoder and bi encoder architectures. Results show that a semantic textual similarity bi encoder achieves much higher correlation with both ground truth and GPT scores than cross encoders, indicating that evaluator architecture is a critical design choice for PoQ. Quality-cost analysis further reveals that the largest models in the pool are also the most efficient in terms of quality per unit latency. Monte Carlo simulations over 5\,000 PoQ rounds demonstrate that the cost-aware reward scheme consistently assigns higher average rewards to high quality low cost inference models and to efficient evaluators, while penalizing slow low quality nodes. These findings suggest that cost-aware PoQ provides a practical foundation for economically sustainable decentralized LLM inference.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that while AI is hyped as transformative, its real impact remains modest, and physics has more to offer current AI than vice versa, proposing 'Big AI' as a synthesis of theoretical rigor with machine learning flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite over a decade of hype about AI's transformative potential, its measurable impact remains modest outside a few high-profile successes. The 2024 Nobel Prizes recognized AI's potential, but broader assessments show the impact is often more promotional than technical. The authors argue that physics has significantly more to offer current AI than AI has to offer physics.

Method: The paper reviews critiques of current AI limitations (large language models, reasoning models, agentic AI), highlights opportunities in quantum AI and analogue computing, and lays down a roadmap for adopting 'Big AI' - a synthesis of theory-based rigor with machine learning flexibility.

Result: The analysis identifies fundamental limitations in current AI architectures: dependence on trillions of meaningless parameters, distributional bias, lack of uncertainty quantification, absence of mechanistic insights, and failure to capture elementary scientific laws. The paper proposes a new direction through 'Big AI' that combines theoretical foundations with machine learning approaches.

Conclusion: While AI may influence physics, physics has much more to offer current AI. The paper calls for moving beyond promotional hype to develop 'Big AI' - a rigorous synthesis of theoretical physics principles with machine learning methods, potentially leveraging quantum AI and analogue computing to address current AI's fundamental limitations.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is commonly depicted as transformative. Yet, after more than a decade of hype, its measurable impact remains modest outside a few high-profile scientific and commercial successes. The 2024 Nobel Prizes in Chemistry and Physics recognized AI's potential, but broader assessments indicate the impact to date is often more promotional than technical. We argue that while current AI may influence physics, physics has significantly more to offer this generation of AI. Current architectures - large language models, reasoning models, and agentic AI - can depend on trillions of meaningless parameters, suffer from distributional bias, lack uncertainty quantification, provide no mechanistic insights, and fail to capture even elementary scientific laws. We review critiques of these limits, highlight opportunities in quantum AI and analogue computing, and lay down a roadmap for the adoption of 'Big AI': a synthesis of theory-based rigour with the flexibility of machine learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a novel optimization algorithm inspired by human behavior in constructing and using transportation paths, addressing limitations of existing metaheuristics.

Method: PCIA mimics human path construction: uses popular routes, intelligently mixes existing paths when closures occur, and randomly explores new routes for unknown destinations. It generates random populations where each particle represents a path toward the destination, similar to swarm-based approaches.

Result: Tested on 53 mathematical optimization problems and 13 constrained optimization problems, PCIA showed highly competitive performance compared to both popular and latest metaheuristic algorithms.

Conclusion: PCIA is an effective new metaheuristic optimization algorithm that successfully translates human path construction behaviors into computational optimization, demonstrating strong performance across diverse problem types.

Abstract: In this paper, a new metaheuristic optimization algorithm, called Path Construction Imitation Algorithm (PCIA), is proposed. PCIA is inspired by how humans construct new paths and use them. Typically, humans prefer popular transportation routes. In the event of a path closure, a new route is built by mixing the existing paths intelligently. Also, humans select different pathways on a random basis to reach unknown destinations. PCIA generates a random population to find the best route toward the destination, similar to swarm-based algorithms. Each particle represents a path toward the destination. PCIA has been tested with 53 mathematical optimization problems and 13 constrained optimization problems. The results showed that the PCIA is highly competitive compared to both popular and the latest metaheuristic algorithms.

Result: Achieves up to 95% success rates in both strategy-constrained and starting-material-constrained synthesis tasks, and demonstrates ability to account for chemical feasibility during route design.

Conclusion: Synthelite represents both a useful tool and a step toward a paradigm where LLMs serve as central orchestrators of synthesis planning, enabling flexible adaptation to user constraints.

Abstract: Computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) has long been envisioned as a complementary tool for synthetic chemists. However, existing frameworks often lack mechanisms to allow interaction with human experts, limiting their ability to integrate chemists' insights. In this work, we introduce Synthelite, a synthesis planning framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to directly propose retrosynthetic transformations. Synthelite can generate end-to-end synthesis routes by harnessing the intrinsic chemical knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, while allowing expert intervention through natural language prompts. Our experiments demonstrate that Synthelite can flexibly adapt its planning trajectory to diverse user-specified constraints, achieving up to 95\% success rates in both strategy-constrained and starting-material-constrained synthesis tasks. Additionally, Synthelite exhibits the ability to account for chemical feasibility during route design. We envision Synthelite to be both a useful tool and a step toward a paradigm where LLMs are the central orchestrators of synthesis planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MARL benchmarks like SMAC use fixed built-in AI opponents, limiting diversity and versatility in algorithm evaluation. Need for more realistic adversarial testing between different MARL algorithms.

Method: Developed SC2BA (StarCraft II Battle Arena) environment for inter-algorithm adversary with fairness, usability, and customizability. Created APyMARL library with easy-to-use interfaces. Benchmarked classic MARL algorithms in two adversarial modes: dual-algorithm paired adversary and multi-algorithm mixed adversary.

Result: Extensive benchmark experiments revealed thought-provoking observations about algorithm effectivity, sensibility, and scalability. The environment successfully enabled adversarial testing between different MARL algorithms.

Conclusion: SC2BA marks a significant advancement for MARL benchmarking by enabling algorithm-vs-algorithm adversarial evaluation, providing more diverse and realistic testing scenarios that could drive future algorithm development.

Abstract: Deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are booming in the field of collaborative intelligence, and StarCraft multi-agent challenge (SMAC) is widely-used as the benchmark therein. However, imaginary opponents of MARL algorithms are practically configured and controlled in a fixed built-in AI mode, which causes less diversity and versatility in algorithm evaluation. To address this issue, in this work, we establish a multi-agent algorithm-vs-algorithm environment, named StarCraft II battle arena (SC2BA), to refresh the benchmarking of MARL algorithms in an adversary paradigm. Taking StarCraft as infrastructure, the SC2BA environment is specifically created for inter-algorithm adversary with the consideration of fairness, usability and customizability, and meantime an adversarial PyMARL (APyMARL) library is developed with easy-to-use interfaces/modules. Grounding in SC2BA, we benchmark those classic MARL algorithms in two types of adversarial modes: dual-algorithm paired adversary and multi-algorithm mixed adversary, where the former conducts the adversary of pairwise algorithms while the latter focuses on the adversary to multiple behaviors from a group of algorithms. The extensive benchmark experiments exhibit some thought-provoking observations/problems in the effectivity, sensibility and scalability of these completed algorithms. The SC2BA environment as well as reproduced experiments are released in \href{https://github.com/dooliu/SC2BA}{Github}, and we believe that this work could mark a new step for the MARL field in the coming years.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs show promise for time-series analysis, their application to real-world battery energy storage system (BESS) operation and maintenance remains largely unexplored, creating a gap between low-level sensor data and high-level decision-making.

Result: TS2R consistently improves LLM performance across accuracy, robustness, and explainability metrics compared to vision-, embedding-, and text-based baselines, achieving expert-level decision quality without retraining.

Conclusion: TS2R establishes a practical path for adaptive, LLM-driven battery intelligence by enabling expert-level performance in BESS management through structured report-based prompting without architecture modifications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for interpreting multivariate time-series data, yet their application to real-world battery energy storage system (BESS) operation and maintenance remains largely unexplored. Here, we present TimeSeries2Report (TS2R), a prompting framework that converts raw lithium-ion battery operational time-series into structured, semantically enriched reports, enabling LLMs to reason, predict, and make decisions in BESS management scenarios. TS2R encodes short-term temporal dynamics into natural language through a combination of segmentation, semantic abstraction, and rule-based interpretation, effectively bridging low-level sensor signals with high-level contextual insights. We benchmark TS2R across both lab-scale and real-world datasets, evaluating report quality and downstream task performance in anomaly detection, state-of-charge prediction, and charging/discharging management. Compared with vision-, embedding-, and text-based prompting baselines, report-based prompting via TS2R consistently improves LLM performance in terms of across accuracy, robustness, and explainability metrics. Notably, TS2R-integrated LLMs achieve expert-level decision quality and predictive consistency without retraining or architecture modification, establishing a practical path for adaptive, LLM-driven battery intelligence.

*Jinwu Chen,Qidie Wu,Bin Li,Lin Ma,Xin Si,Yang Hu,Shouyi Yin,Jun Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: cuPilot is a multi-agent framework that uses strategy-level evolution to automatically optimize CUDA kernels, achieving 3.09× speedup over PyTorch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CUDA kernel optimization requires specialized hardware-software expertise and access to proprietary libraries. Existing LLM-based approaches with evolutionary algorithms underperform due to poor agent designs and mismatched evolution representations.

Method: Proposes cuPilot: a strategy-coordinated multi-agent framework that introduces strategy as intermediate semantic representation for kernel evolution. Includes strategy-coordinated evolution algorithm, roofline-guided prompting, and strategy-level population initialization.

Result: Generated kernels achieve average 3.09× speedup over PyTorch on 100-kernel benchmark. On GEMM tasks, shows sophisticated optimizations and high utilization of critical hardware units.

Conclusion: cuPilot effectively addresses representation mismatches in kernel optimization through strategy-level evolution, enabling automatic generation of high-performance CUDA kernels without requiring specialized expertise.

Abstract: Optimizing CUDA kernels is a challenging and labor-intensive task, given the need for hardware-software co-design expertise and the proprietary nature of high-performance kernel libraries. While recent large language models (LLMs) combined with evolutionary algorithms show promise in automatic kernel optimization, existing approaches often fall short in performance due to their suboptimal agent designs and mismatched evolution representations. This work identifies these mismatches and proposes cuPilot, a strategy-coordinated multi-agent framework that introduces strategy as an intermediate semantic representation for kernel evolution. Key contributions include a strategy-coordinated evolution algorithm, roofline-guided prompting, and strategy-level population initialization. Experimental results show that the generated kernels by cuPilot achieve an average speed up of 3.09$\times$ over PyTorch on a benchmark of 100 kernels. On the GEMM tasks, cuPilot showcases sophisticated optimizations and achieves high utilization of critical hardware units. The generated kernels are open-sourced at https://github.com/champloo2878/cuPilot-Kernels.git.

### [151] [Quantifying and Bridging the Fidelity Gap: A Decisive-Feature Approach to Comparing Synthetic and Real Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16468)
*Danial Safaei,Siddartha Khastgir,Mohsen Alirezaei,Jeroen Ploeg,Son Tong,Xingyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Decisive Feature Fidelity (DFF), a new SUT-specific metric that measures whether autonomous vehicle systems use the same causal evidence in both real and simulated environments, addressing limitations of visual realism alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current virtual testing for AV safety relies on synthetic data, but pixel-level visual realism doesn't guarantee reliable simulation-to-real transfer. The key issue is whether systems base decisions on the same causal evidence across domains, not just whether images "look real" to humans.

Method: Introduces Decisive Feature Fidelity (DFF) that extends the fidelity spectrum to capture mechanism parity - agreement in causal evidence underlying SUT decisions. Uses explainable-AI methods to identify and compare decisive features driving SUT outputs for matched real-synthetic pairs. Proposes practical estimators based on counterfactual explanations and a DFF-guided calibration scheme.

Result: Experiments on 2126 matched KITTI-VirtualKITTI2 pairs show DFF reveals discrepancies overlooked by conventional output-value fidelity. DFF-guided calibration improves decisive-feature and input-level fidelity without sacrificing output value fidelity across diverse SUTs.

Conclusion: DFF provides a behavior-grounded fidelity measure that addresses the limitations of visual realism alone, enabling more reliable simulation-to-real transfer for autonomous vehicle safety assurance by ensuring systems use the same causal evidence across domains.

Abstract: Virtual testing using synthetic data has become a cornerstone of autonomous vehicle (AV) safety assurance. Despite progress in improving visual realism through advanced simulators and generative AI, recent studies reveal that pixel-level fidelity alone does not ensure reliable transfer from simulation to the real world. What truly matters is whether the system-under-test (SUT) bases its decisions on the same causal evidence in both real and simulated environments - not just whether images "look real" to humans. This paper addresses the lack of such a behavior-grounded fidelity measure by introducing Decisive Feature Fidelity (DFF), a new SUT-specific metric that extends the existing fidelity spectrum to capture mechanism parity - the agreement in causal evidence underlying the SUT's decisions across domains. DFF leverages explainable-AI (XAI) methods to identify and compare the decisive features driving the SUT's outputs for matched real-synthetic pairs. We further propose practical estimators based on counterfactual explanations, along with a DFF-guided calibration scheme to enhance simulator fidelity. Experiments on 2126 matched KITTI-VirtualKITTI2 pairs demonstrate that DFF reveals discrepancies overlooked by conventional output-value fidelity. Furthermore, results show that DFF-guided calibration improves decisive-feature and input-level fidelity without sacrificing output value fidelity across diverse SUTs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Meta-algorithmic research (algorithm selection, configuration, scheduling) relies on computationally expensive experiments with many error sources that threaten scalability and validity. Best practices exist but are scattered across publications and fields, evolving separately.

Method: Collects and synthesizes good practices across COSEAL community subfields, covering the complete experimental cycle: research question formulation, experimental design selection, experiment execution, and impartial analysis/presentation of results.

Result: Establishes current state-of-the-art practices in meta-algorithmic research and creates a comprehensive guideline for both new researchers and practitioners in meta-algorithmic fields.

Conclusion: Provides a unified reference for empirical meta-algorithmic research practices, addressing the fragmentation of best practices across different publications and fields, and supporting more valid and scalable scientific insights.

Abstract: Empirical research on meta-algorithmics, such as algorithm selection, configuration, and scheduling, often relies on extensive and thus computationally expensive experiments. With the large degree of freedom we have over our experimental setup and design comes a plethora of possible error sources that threaten the scalability and validity of our scientific insights. Best practices for meta-algorithmic research exist, but they are scattered between different publications and fields, and continue to evolve separately from each other. In this report, we collect good practices for empirical meta-algorithmic research across the subfields of the COSEAL community, encompassing the entire experimental cycle: from formulating research questions and selecting an experimental design, to executing ex- periments, and ultimately, analyzing and presenting results impartially. It establishes the current state-of-the-art practices within meta-algorithmic research and serves as a guideline to both new researchers and practitioners in meta-algorithmic fields.

*Julien Gachadoat,Guillaume Lagarde*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ParamExplorer is an interactive framework using reinforcement learning concepts to help artists explore complex parameter spaces in generative art, with modular agents and p5.js integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative art systems have high-dimensional parameter spaces where aesthetically pleasing outputs are rare and fragmented, forcing artists to rely on inefficient manual trial-and-error that leaves many interesting configurations undiscovered.

Method: Introduces ParamExplorer, an interactive modular framework inspired by reinforcement learning that facilitates parameter space exploration with human-in-the-loop or automated feedback, with seamless p5.js integration and multiple exploration strategies (agents).

Result: The paper presents the ParamExplorer framework and implements/evaluates several exploration strategies (agents) within this framework, though specific evaluation results are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: ParamExplorer provides a systematic approach to exploring complex generative art parameter spaces, reducing reliance on manual trial-and-error and enabling discovery of more aesthetically interesting configurations through guided exploration strategies.

Abstract: Generative art systems often involve high-dimensional and complex parameter spaces in which aesthetically compelling outputs occupy only small, fragmented regions. Because of this combinatorial explosion, artists typically rely on extensive manual trial-and-error, leaving many potentially interesting configurations undiscovered. In this work we make two contributions. First, we introduce ParamExplorer, an interactive and modular framework inspired by reinforcement learning that helps the exploration of parameter spaces in generative art algorithms, guided by human-in-the-loop or even automated feedback. The framework also integrates seamlessly with existing p5.js projects. Second, within this framework we implement and evaluate several exploration strategies, referred to as agents.

*Ander Alvarez,Alessandro Genuardi,Nilotpal Sinha,Antonio Tiene,Samuel Mugel,Román Orús*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CPU-only inference scaling laws for local LLMs/VLMs: compute scales linearly with token length for LLMs, VLMs have resolution "knee" due to preprocessing; quantum-inspired compression reduces compute/memory by up to 72% and energy by 62% while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most consumer hardware relies on CPUs rather than GPUs for AI deployment, but CPU-only inference scaling laws for local language and vision-language models remain unexplored, creating a gap in understanding computational requirements for edge devices.

Method: Systematic benchmarking of LLMs and VLMs on two CPU tiers (MacBook Pro M2 for laptops, Raspberry Pi 5 for embedded). Used unified methodology with continuous sampling of processor/memory usage and area-under-curve integration to characterize computational scaling with input text length (LLMs) and image resolution (VLMs).

Result: Two empirical scaling laws: (1) LLM compute scales approximately linearly with token length; (2) VLMs exhibit "resolution knee" where compute remains constant above internal resolution clamp and decreases sharply below it. Quantum-inspired compression reduces processor/memory usage by up to 71.9% and energy by 62% while preserving/improving semantic accuracy.

Conclusion: Provides systematic quantification of multimodal CPU-only scaling for local AI workloads, identifying model compression and input-resolution preprocessing as effective, low-cost levers for sustainable edge inference on consumer hardware.

Abstract: Deploying local large language models and vision-language models on edge devices requires balancing accuracy with constrained computational and energy budgets. Although graphics processors dominate modern artificial-intelligence deployment, most consumer hardware--including laptops, desktops, industrial controllers, and embedded systems--relies on central processing units. Despite this, the computational laws governing central-processing-unit-only inference for local language and vision-language workloads remain largely unexplored. We systematically benchmark large language and vision-language models on two representative central-processing-unit tiers widely used for local inference: a MacBook Pro M2, reflecting mainstream laptop-class deployment, and a Raspberry Pi 5, representing constrained, low-power embedded settings. Using a unified methodology based on continuous sampling of processor and memory usage together with area-under-curve integration, we characterize how computational load scales with input text length for language models and with image resolution for vision-language models. We uncover two empirical scaling laws: (1) computational cost for language-model inference scales approximately linearly with token length; and (2) vision-language models exhibit a preprocessing-driven "resolution knee", where compute remains constant above an internal resolution clamp and decreases sharply below it. Beyond these laws, we show that quantum-inspired compression reduces processor and memory usage by up to 71.9% and energy consumption by up to 62%, while preserving or improving semantic accuracy. These results provide a systematic quantification of multimodal central-processing-unit-only scaling for local language and vision-language workloads, and they identify model compression and input-resolution preprocessing as effective, low-cost levers for sustainable edge inference.

*Himanshu Gharat,Himanshi Agrawal,Gourab K. Patro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Memory-enhanced LLM agents introduce systematic bias through personalization, even with safety-trained models, requiring additional protective measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While memory-enhanced personalization in LLM agents offers benefits like continuity and improved relevance, it introduces unexplored risks of bias amplification that need investigation.

Method: Simulated memory-enhanced personalized agent behavior using recruitment as a case study, testing with safety-trained LLMs across various operational stages.

Result: Experiments reveal that bias is systematically introduced and reinforced through personalization in memory-enhanced agents, even when using safety-trained LLMs.

Conclusion: Memory-enhanced personalized LLM agents require additional protective measures or guardrails to mitigate systematic bias introduced through personalization.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have empowered AI agents with advanced capabilities for understanding, reasoning, and interacting across diverse tasks. The addition of memory further enhances them by enabling continuity across interactions, learning from past experiences, and improving the relevance of actions and responses over time; termed as memory-enhanced personalization. Although such personalization through memory offers clear benefits, it also introduces risks of bias. While several previous studies have highlighted bias in ML and LLMs, bias due to memory-enhanced personalized agents is largely unexplored. Using recruitment as an example use case, we simulate the behavior of a memory-enhanced personalized agent, and study whether and how bias is introduced and amplified in and across various stages of operation. Our experiments on agents using safety-trained LLMs reveal that bias is systematically introduced and reinforced through personalization, emphasizing the need for additional protective measures or agent guardrails in memory-enhanced LLM-based AI agents.

TL;DR: Needle in the Web is a new benchmark for evaluating LLM search agents on fuzzy exploratory search tasks with ambiguous queries, where current models struggle with below 35% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on complex reasoning searches but neglect fuzzy exploratory search where queries are vague and multifaceted, requiring retrieval of relevant webpages rather than single factual answers.

Method: Created Needle in the Web benchmark with 663 questions across 7 domains using flexible methodology to generate queries of controllable difficulty based on factual claims from web content.

Result: Most models achieve below 35% accuracy, with none consistently excelling across domains or difficulty levels, revealing significant challenges for current search systems.

Conclusion: Needle in the Web presents a significant challenge for current search systems and highlights the open problem of effective fuzzy retrieval under semantic ambiguity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved from simple chatbots into sophisticated agents capable of automating complex real-world tasks, where browsing and reasoning over live web content is key to assessing retrieval and cognitive skills. Existing benchmarks like BrowseComp and xBench-DeepSearch emphasize complex reasoning searches requiring multi-hop synthesis but neglect Fuzzy Exploratory Search, namely queries that are vague and multifaceted, where users seek the most relevant webpage rather than a single factual answer. To address this gap, we introduce Needle in the Web, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate modern search agents and LLM-based systems on their ability to retrieve and reason over real-world web content in response to ambiguous, exploratory queries under varying levels of difficulty. Needle in the Web comprises 663 questions spanning seven distinct domains. To ensure high query quality and answer uniqueness, we employ a flexible methodology that reliably generates queries of controllable difficulty based on factual claims of web contents. We benchmark three leading LLMs and three agent-based search systems on Needle in the Web, finding that most models struggle: many achieve below 35% accuracy, and none consistently excel across domains or difficulty levels. These findings reveal that Needle in the Web presents a significant challenge for current search systems and highlights the open problem of effective fuzzy retrieval under semantic ambiguity.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Prefix Probing: A black-box harmful content detection method using prefix probability comparisons with caching for near-first-token latency, requiring no extra models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face trade-offs between detection accuracy, inference latency, and deployment cost in safety-sensitive applications. Existing methods often require external models or multi-stage inference, increasing overhead.

Method: Compares conditional log-probabilities of "agreement/execution" vs "refusal/safety" opening prefixes using prefix caching. Uses single log-probability computation over probe prefixes to generate harmfulness score. Includes efficient prefix construction algorithm to discover highly informative prefixes automatically.

Result: Achieves detection effectiveness comparable to mainstream external safety models with minimal computational cost. Requires no extra model deployment and reduces detection overhead to near first-token latency.

Conclusion: Prefix Probing offers strong practicality and efficiency for harmful content detection in LLMs, balancing accuracy, latency, and cost without requiring additional models or complex inference pipelines.

Abstract: Large language models often face a three-way trade-off among detection accuracy, inference latency, and deployment cost when used in real-world safety-sensitive applications. This paper introduces Prefix Probing, a black-box harmful content detection method that compares the conditional log-probabilities of "agreement/execution" versus "refusal/safety" opening prefixes and leverages prefix caching to reduce detection overhead to near first-token latency. During inference, the method requires only a single log-probability computation over the probe prefixes to produce a harmfulness score and apply a threshold, without invoking any additional models or multi-stage inference. To further enhance the discriminative power of the prefixes, we design an efficient prefix construction algorithm that automatically discovers highly informative prefixes, substantially improving detection performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Prefix Probing achieves detection effectiveness comparable to mainstream external safety models while incurring only minimal computational cost and requiring no extra model deployment, highlighting its strong practicality and efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper argues for shifting AI education from functional skills to comprehensive literacy centered on human agency, critical thinking, and ethical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI education frameworks fail to address the growing literacy gap, focusing too much on operational skills while neglecting critical and ethical reasoning about AI technologies.

Method: Proposes AI Literacy, Fluency, and Competency frameworks that center human agency - empowering intentional, critical, and responsible choices about AI use for all educational stakeholders.

Result: The frameworks enable educators and students to become agents in human-centric AI approaches, providing pathways to articulate intentions and understand AI's impact on academic work, careers, and society.

Conclusion: True AI literacy requires teaching about agency itself, framing technology as a choice rather than inevitability, with deep commitment to critical thinking and epistemology.

Abstract: The rapid assimilation of Artificial Intelligence technologies into various facets of society has created a significant educational imperative that current frameworks are failing to effectively address. We are witnessing the rise of a dangerous literacy gap, where a focus on the functional, operational skills of using AI tools is eclipsing the development of critical and ethical reasoning about them. This position paper argues for a systemic shift toward comprehensive AI literacy that centers human agency - the empowered capacity for intentional, critical, and responsible choice. This principle applies to all stakeholders in the educational ecosystem: it is the student's agency to question, create with, or consciously decide not to use AI based on the task; it is the teacher's agency to design learning experiences that align with instructional values, rather than ceding pedagogical control to a tool. True literacy involves teaching about agency itself, framing technology not as an inevitability to be adopted, but as a choice to be made. This requires a deep commitment to critical thinking and a robust understanding of epistemology. Through the AI Literacy, Fluency, and Competency frameworks described in this paper, educators and students will become agents in their own human-centric approaches to AI, providing necessary pathways to clearly articulate the intentions informing decisions and attitudes toward AI and the impact of these decisions on academic work, career, and society.

Motivation: To automate thematic grouping of hadith texts as part of digitalization efforts in Islamic studies, addressing the need for automated analysis of growing digital Islamic text collections.

Method: Unsupervised learning approach using Apriori algorithm for association rule mining on Indonesian Translation of Bukhari hadith. Preprocessing includes case folding, punctuation cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming. Analysis uses support, confidence, and lift parameters.

Result: Meaningful association patterns identified including rakaat-prayer, verse-revelation, and hadith-story relationships, which correspond to themes of worship, revelation, and hadith narration.

Conclusion: Apriori algorithm effectively uncovers latent semantic relationships in hadith texts, contributing to digital Islamic studies and technology-based learning systems development.

Abstract: This research stems from the urgency to automate the thematic grouping of hadith in line with the growing digitalization of Islamic texts. Based on a literature review, the unsupervised learning approach with the Apriori algorithm has proven effective in identifying association patterns and semantic relations in unlabeled text data. The dataset used is the Indonesian Translation of the hadith of Bukhari, which first goes through preprocessing stages including case folding, punctuation cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming. Next, an association rule mining analysis was conducted using the Apriori algorithm with support, confidence, and lift parameters. The results show the existence of meaningful association patterns such as the relationship between rakaat-prayer, verse-revelation, and hadith-story, which describe the themes of worship, revelation, and hadith narration. These findings demonstrate that the Apriori algorithm has the ability to automatically uncover latent semantic relationships, while contributing to the development of digital Islamic studies and technology-based learning systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Multi-agent pipelines consistently improve performance for open-source MLLMs on visual math benchmarks, but closed-source models like Gemini-2.0-Flash generally perform better in single-agent mode on classic benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically compare the benefits of multi-agent vs single-agent designs for diagram-grounded geometry problem solving in multimodal large language models, as the relative advantages remain unclear.

Method: Systematic comparison of single-agent and multi-agent pipelines on four visual math benchmarks: Geometry3K, MathVerse, OlympiadBench, and We-Math, using both open-source (Qwen-2.5-VL variants) and closed-source (Gemini-2.0-Flash) models.

Result: Open-source models consistently benefit from multi-agent pipelines (e.g., Qwen-2.5-VL 7B gains +6.8 points on Geometry3K), while closed-source Gemini-2.0-Flash generally performs better in single-agent mode on classic benchmarks, with only modest multi-agent improvements on newer We-Math dataset.

Conclusion: Multi-agent pipelines provide clear benefits for open-source models and can assist strong proprietary systems on newer, less familiar benchmarks, but agentic decomposition is not universally optimal - the effectiveness depends on model type and benchmark characteristics.

Abstract: Diagram-grounded geometry problem solving is a critical benchmark for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), yet the benefits of multi-agent design over single-agent remain unclear. We systematically compare single-agent and multi-agent pipelines on four visual math benchmarks: Geometry3K, MathVerse, OlympiadBench, and We-Math. For open-source models, multi-agent consistently improves performance. For example, Qwen-2.5-VL (7B) gains +6.8 points and Qwen-2.5-VL (32B) gains +3.3 on Geometry3K, and both Qwen-2.5-VL variants see further gains on OlympiadBench and We-Math. In contrast, the closed-source Gemini-2.0-Flash generally performs better in single-agent mode on classic benchmarks, while multi-agent yields only modest improvements on the newer We-Math dataset. These findings show that multi-agent pipelines provide clear benefits for open-source models and can assist strong proprietary systems on newer, less familiar benchmarks, but agentic decomposition is not universally optimal.

Motivation: GenAI is reshaping knowledge production in education, raising concerns about epistemic automation, cognitive offloading, and teacher de-professionalization. Need to reclaim human agency in AI-enabled learning environments.

Method: Proposes Cyber Humanism framework with three pillars: reflexive competence, algorithmic citizenship, dialogic design. Presents higher-education case studies using prompt-based learning and Conversational AI Educator certification within EPICT ecosystem.

Result: Findings show practices can strengthen epistemic agency while surfacing tensions around workload, equity, and governance. Outlines implications for AI-rich, human-centred education.

Conclusion: Cyber Humanism provides a framework for positioning educators and learners as epistemic agents and algorithmic citizens who co-author AI-enabled learning infrastructures, balancing technological capabilities with human agency.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is rapidly reshaping how knowledge is produced and validated in education. Rather than adding another digital tool, large language models reconfigure reading, writing, and coding into hybrid human-AI workflows, raising concerns about epistemic automation, cognitive offloading, and the de-professiona\-lisation of teachers. This paper proposes \emph{Cyber Humanism in Education} as a framework for reclaiming human agency in this landscape. We conceptualise AI-enabled learning environments as socio-technical infrastructures co-authored by humans and machines, and position educators and learners as epistemic agents and \emph{algorithmic citizens} who have both the right and the responsibility to shape these infrastructures.
  We articulate three pillars for cyber-humanist design, \emph{reflexive competence}, \emph{algorithmic citizenship}, and \emph{dialogic design}, and relate them to major international digital and AI competence frameworks. We then present higher-education case studies that operationalise these ideas through \emph{prompt-based learning} and a new \emph{Conversational AI Educator} certification within the EPICT ecosystem. The findings show how such practices can strengthen epistemic agency while surfacing tensions around workload, equity, and governance, and outline implications for the future of AI-rich, human-centred education.

*Abhisek Ganguly*

TL;DR: Algorithmic intelligence faces fundamental limits from formal incompleteness (deductive reasoning constraints) and dynamical unpredictability (prediction bounds), preventing agents from computing their own maximal prediction horizon.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fundamental computational constraints on algorithmic intelligence, specifically how formal incompleteness (from logic) and dynamical unpredictability (from chaos theory) combine to limit an agent's self-analysis capabilities.

Method: Formalization of two independent computational limitations: formal incompleteness (constraining deductive reasoning in consistent systems) and dynamical unpredictability (bounding long-term prediction under finite precision). Analysis of how these constraints interact to impose structural bounds on self-referential reasoning.

Result: The combination of formal incompleteness and dynamical unpredictability prevents algorithmic agents from generally computing their own maximal prediction horizon, revealing inherent trade-offs between reasoning, prediction, and self-analysis.

Conclusion: Intelligent systems face fundamental structural limitations that constrain their ability to reason about their own predictive capabilities, highlighting unavoidable trade-offs between different aspects of intelligence.

Abstract: We formalize two independent computational limitations that constrain algorithmic intelligence: formal incompleteness and dynamical unpredictability. The former limits the deductive power of consistent reasoning systems while the later bounds long-term prediction under finite precision. We show that these two extrema together impose structural bounds on an agent's ability to reason about its own predictive capabilities. In particular, an algorithmic agent cannot compute its own maximal prediction horizon generally. This perspective clarifies inherent trade-offs between reasoning, prediction, and self-analysis in intelligent systems.

Conclusion: PDDL-style representations can effectively learn and model black-box AI planning capabilities, providing interpretable models that describe capabilities, execution conditions, outcomes, and probabilities for safer deployment.

Abstract: Black-box AI (BBAI) systems such as foundational models are increasingly being used for sequential decision making. To ensure that such systems are safe to operate and deploy, it is imperative to develop efficient methods that can provide a sound and interpretable representation of the BBAI's capabilities. This paper shows that PDDL-style representations can be used to efficiently learn and model an input BBAI's planning capabilities. It uses the Monte-Carlo tree search paradigm to systematically create test tasks, acquire data, and prune the hypothesis space of possible symbolic models. Learned models describe a BBAI's capabilities, the conditions under which they can be executed, and the possible outcomes of executing them along with their associated probabilities. Theoretical results show soundness, completeness and convergence of the learned models. Empirical results with multiple BBAI systems illustrate the scope, efficiency, and accuracy of the presented methods.

*Yipeng Zhuang,Yifeng Guo,Yuewen Li,Yuheng Wu,Philip Leung-Ho Yu,Tingting Song,Zhiyong Wang,Kunzhong Zhou,Weifang Wang,Li Zhuang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hybrid ML+LLM pipeline predicts lung cancer patients' breakthrough pain episodes 48-72 hours ahead using EHR data, achieving 87-92% accuracy with improved sensitivity through multimodal integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lung cancer patients experience high rates of breakthrough pain (up to 91%), requiring timely intervention. Current approaches lack proactive prediction capabilities, leading to reactive rather than preventive pain management.

Method: Hybrid pipeline combining machine learning and large language models. ML captures temporal medication trends from structured EHR data (demographics, tumor stage, vital signs, analgesic use), while LLM interprets ambiguous dosing records and free-text clinical notes. Retrospective analysis of 266 inpatients.

Result: Achieved accuracy of 0.874 (48h prediction) and 0.917 (72h prediction). LLM augmentation improved sensitivity by 8.6% (48h) and 10.4% (72h). The framework provides clinically interpretable predictions for early pain episode forecasting.

Conclusion: The hybrid ML+LLM approach offers a clinically interpretable, scalable tool for proactive pain management in oncology care, with potential to enhance treatment precision and optimize resource allocation through early pain episode prediction.

Abstract: Lung cancer patients frequently experience breakthrough pain episodes, with up to 91% requiring timely intervention. To enable proactive pain management, we propose a hybrid machine learning and large language model pipeline that predicts pain episodes within 48 and 72 hours of hospitalization using both structured and unstructured electronic health record data. A retrospective cohort of 266 inpatients was analyzed, with features including demographics, tumor stage, vital signs, and WHO-tiered analgesic use. The machine learning module captured temporal medication trends, while the large language model interpreted ambiguous dosing records and free-text clinical notes. Integrating these modalities improved sensitivity and interpretability. Our framework achieved an accuracy of 0.874 (48h) and 0.917 (72h), with an improvement in sensitivity of 8.6% and 10.4% due to the augmentation of large language model. This hybrid approach offers a clinically interpretable and scalable tool for early pain episode forecasting, with potential to enhance treatment precision and optimize resource allocation in oncology care.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CitySeeker benchmark tests VLMs' ability to navigate urban environments based on implicit human needs (e.g., "I am thirsty"), revealing poor performance (21.1% completion) and identifying key bottlenecks in spatial reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While VLMs have advanced in explicit instruction navigation, their ability to interpret implicit human needs in dynamic urban environments remains underexplored, creating a gap for addressing real-world "last-mile" navigation challenges.

Method: Introduces CitySeeker benchmark with 6,440 trajectories across 8 cities covering 7 goal-driven scenarios with implicit needs. Analyzes VLMs' performance and proposes BCR strategies (Backtracking Mechanisms, Enriching Spatial Cognition, Memory-Based Retrieval) inspired by human cognitive mapping.

Result: Even top-performing VLMs (Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct) achieve only 21.1% task completion. Key bottlenecks identified: error accumulation in long-horizon reasoning, inadequate spatial cognition, and deficient experiential recall.

Conclusion: The paper provides actionable insights for developing VLMs with robust spatial intelligence needed for "last-mile" navigation challenges, highlighting the need for improved spatial reasoning, memory, and adaptive path optimization capabilities.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made significant progress in explicit instruction-based navigation; however, their ability to interpret implicit human needs (e.g., "I am thirsty") in dynamic urban environments remains underexplored. This paper introduces CitySeeker, a novel benchmark designed to assess VLMs' spatial reasoning and decision-making capabilities for exploring embodied urban navigation to address implicit needs. CitySeeker includes 6,440 trajectories across 8 cities, capturing diverse visual characteristics and implicit needs in 7 goal-driven scenarios. Extensive experiments reveal that even top-performing models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct) achieve only 21.1% task completion. We find key bottlenecks in error accumulation in long-horizon reasoning, inadequate spatial cognition, and deficient experiential recall. To further analyze them, we investigate a series of exploratory strategies-Backtracking Mechanisms, Enriching Spatial Cognition, and Memory-Based Retrieval (BCR), inspired by human cognitive mapping's emphasis on iterative observation-reasoning cycles and adaptive path optimization. Our analysis provides actionable insights for developing VLMs with robust spatial intelligence required for tackling "last-mile" navigation challenges.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TOGGLE is a novel LLM compression framework that uses Signal Temporal Logic to formally guarantee preservation of linguistic properties during compression, achieving up to 3.3x FLOPs reduction and 68.8% model size reduction without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs require substantial computational resources that limit deployment on edge devices, and existing compression techniques often degrade linguistic properties without formal guarantees for preserving model behavior.

Method: TOGGLE uses Signal Temporal Logic (STL) to formally specify linguistic properties, then employs STL robustness-guided Bayesian optimization to systematically explore layer-wise quantization and pruning configurations, generating compressed models that satisfy linguistic constraints without retraining.

Result: Evaluated on GPT-2, DeepSeek-V2 7B, LLaMA 3 8B, and Mistral 7B, TOGGLE achieves up to 3.3x reduction in computational costs (FLOPs) and up to 68.8% reduction in model size while satisfying all specified linguistic properties.

Conclusion: TOGGLE represents the first integration of formal methods into LLM compression, enabling efficient, verifiable deployment of LLMs on edge hardware with formal guarantees for preserving linguistic properties.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver exceptional performance across natural language tasks but demand substantial computational resources, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Existing compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning, often degrade critical linguistic properties and lack formal guarantees for preserving model behavior. We propose Temporal Logic-Guided Large Language Model Compression (TOGGLE), a novel framework that leverages Signal Temporal Logic (STL) to formally specify and enforce linguistic properties during compression. TOGGLE employs an STL robustness-guided Bayesian optimization to systematically explore layer-wise quantization and pruning configurations, generating compressed models that formally satisfy specified linguistic constraints without retraining or fine-tuning. Evaluating TOGGLE on four LLM architectures (GPT-2, DeepSeek-V2 7B, LLaMA 3 8B, and Mistral 7B), we achieve up to 3.3x reduction in computational costs (FLOPs) and up to a 68.8% reduction in model size while satisfying all linguistic properties. TOGGLE represents the first integration of formal methods into LLM compression, enabling efficient, verifiable deployment of LLMs on edge hardware.

*Nenad Tomašev,Matija Franklin,Julian Jacobs,Sébastien Krier,Simon Osindero*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that AI safety research should consider "patchwork AGI" scenarios where general intelligence emerges from coordinated groups of sub-AGI agents, and proposes a framework using virtual agentic sandbox economies with market mechanisms for collective risk mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI safety research focuses on individual AI systems assuming monolithic AGI emergence, but overlooks the alternative "patchwork AGI" hypothesis where general capabilities emerge from coordinated groups of sub-AGI agents with complementary skills.

Method: Proposes a framework for distributional AGI safety that moves beyond individual agent alignment, centered on designing virtual agentic sandbox economies (impermeable or semi-permeable) where agent-to-agent transactions are governed by robust market mechanisms with auditability, reputation management, and oversight.

Result: The paper establishes the urgency of considering patchwork AGI scenarios given rapid deployment of advanced AI agents with tool-use and coordination capabilities, and provides a conceptual framework for addressing collective risks in distributed AGI systems.

Conclusion: The patchwork AGI hypothesis needs serious consideration in safety research, requiring new safeguards and mitigations focused on collective risks through structured virtual economies with market governance mechanisms.

Abstract: AI safety and alignment research has predominantly been focused on methods for safeguarding individual AI systems, resting on the assumption of an eventual emergence of a monolithic Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The alternative AGI emergence hypothesis, where general capability levels are first manifested through coordination in groups of sub-AGI individual agents with complementary skills and affordances, has received far less attention. Here we argue that this patchwork AGI hypothesis needs to be given serious consideration, and should inform the development of corresponding safeguards and mitigations. The rapid deployment of advanced AI agents with tool-use capabilities and the ability to communicate and coordinate makes this an urgent safety consideration. We therefore propose a framework for distributional AGI safety that moves beyond evaluating and aligning individual agents. This framework centers on the design and implementation of virtual agentic sandbox economies (impermeable or semi-permeable), where agent-to-agent transactions are governed by robust market mechanisms, coupled with appropriate auditability, reputation management, and oversight to mitigate collective risks.

*Otman A. Basir*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The Social Responsibility Stack (SRS) is a six-layer architectural framework that embeds societal values into AI systems through explicit constraints, safeguards, and governance processes, treating responsibility as a closed-loop supervisory control problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current responsible AI and governance efforts provide normative principles but lack enforceable engineering mechanisms that operate throughout the system lifecycle, creating a gap between ethics and practical implementation.

Method: Introduces the Social Responsibility Stack (SRS), a six-layer architectural framework with a unified constraint-based formulation, safety-envelope and feedback interpretations, and continuous monitoring of fairness, autonomy, cognitive burden, and explanation quality.

Result: Case studies in clinical decision support, cooperative autonomous vehicles, and public-sector systems demonstrate how SRS translates normative objectives into actionable engineering and operational controls.

Conclusion: SRS bridges ethics, control theory, and AI governance, providing a practical foundation for accountable, adaptive, and auditable socio-technical AI systems that embed societal values throughout their lifecycle.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems are increasingly deployed in domains that shape human behaviour, institutional decision-making, and societal outcomes. Existing responsible AI and governance efforts provide important normative principles but often lack enforceable engineering mechanisms that operate throughout the system lifecycle. This paper introduces the Social Responsibility Stack (SRS), a six-layer architectural framework that embeds societal values into AI systems as explicit constraints, safeguards, behavioural interfaces, auditing mechanisms, and governance processes. SRS models responsibility as a closed-loop supervisory control problem over socio-technical systems, integrating design-time safeguards with runtime monitoring and institutional oversight. We develop a unified constraint-based formulation, introduce safety-envelope and feedback interpretations, and show how fairness, autonomy, cognitive burden, and explanation quality can be continuously monitored and enforced. Case studies in clinical decision support, cooperative autonomous vehicles, and public-sector systems illustrate how SRS translates normative objectives into actionable engineering and operational controls. The framework bridges ethics, control theory, and AI governance, providing a practical foundation for accountable, adaptive, and auditable socio-technical AI systems.

*Qihao Liu,Luoxin Ye,Wufei Ma,Yu-Cheng Chou,Alan Yuille*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Generative Adversarial Reasoner (GAR) uses adversarial RL with LLM reasoner and discriminator to improve mathematical reasoning by providing dense step-level rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs with reasoning capabilities still make process errors like incorrect calculations, brittle logic, and invalid steps, needing better training to improve reasoning quality.

Method: On-policy joint training framework with LLM reasoner and LLM-based discriminator co-evolved through adversarial RL. Uses compute-efficient review schedule to partition reasoning chains into slices, with discriminator evaluating each slice's soundness with structured justifications.

Result: Consistent gains across mathematical benchmarks: improved DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B from 54.0 to 61.3 (+7.3) and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B from 43.7 to 53.7 (+10.0) on AIME24.

Conclusion: GAR produces dense, well-calibrated step-level rewards that improve credit assignment, increase sample efficiency, and enhance overall reasoning quality, with modular discriminator enabling flexible reward shaping for various objectives.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with explicit reasoning capabilities excel at mathematical reasoning yet still commit process errors, such as incorrect calculations, brittle logic, and superficially plausible but invalid steps. In this paper, we introduce Generative Adversarial Reasoner, an on-policy joint training framework designed to enhance reasoning by co-evolving an LLM reasoner and an LLM-based discriminator through adversarial reinforcement learning. A compute-efficient review schedule partitions each reasoning chain into logically complete slices of comparable length, and the discriminator evaluates each slice's soundness with concise, structured justifications. Learning couples complementary signals: the LLM reasoner is rewarded for logically consistent steps that yield correct answers, while the discriminator earns rewards for correctly detecting errors or distinguishing traces in the reasoning process. This produces dense, well-calibrated, on-policy step-level rewards that supplement sparse exact-match signals, improving credit assignment, increasing sample efficiency, and enhancing overall reasoning quality of LLMs. Across various mathematical benchmarks, the method delivers consistent gains over strong baselines with standard RL post-training. Specifically, on AIME24, we improve DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B from 54.0 to 61.3 (+7.3) and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B from 43.7 to 53.7 (+10.0). The modular discriminator also enables flexible reward shaping for objectives such as teacher distillation, preference alignment, and mathematical proof-based reasoning.

TL;DR: Large Video Planner (LVP) uses internet-scale video pretraining instead of MLLMs to build robot foundation models, generating zero-shot video plans for novel tasks that can be executed by robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robot foundation models extend MLLMs with action outputs, but videos better capture spatio-temporal sequences of states and actions that are naturally aligned with robotic behavior.

Method: Curate internet-scale video dataset of human activities and task demonstrations, train open video model at foundation-model scale for generative robotics planning, post-process video plans to extract executable robot actions.

Result: Model produces zero-shot video plans for novel scenes and tasks, demonstrates successful physical execution in third-party selected tasks and real-robot experiments with robust instruction following and strong generalization.

Conclusion: Video pretraining is a viable alternative to MLLMs for building robot foundation models, showing real-world feasibility; model and dataset are released for open, reproducible video-based robot learning.

Abstract: General-purpose robots require decision-making models that generalize across diverse tasks and environments. Recent works build robot foundation models by extending multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with action outputs, creating vision-language-action (VLA) systems. These efforts are motivated by the intuition that MLLMs' large-scale language and image pretraining can be effectively transferred to the action output modality. In this work, we explore an alternative paradigm of using large-scale video pretraining as a primary modality for building robot foundation models. Unlike static images and language, videos capture spatio-temporal sequences of states and actions in the physical world that are naturally aligned with robotic behavior. We curate an internet-scale video dataset of human activities and task demonstrations, and train, for the first time at a foundation-model scale, an open video model for generative robotics planning. The model produces zero-shot video plans for novel scenes and tasks, which we post-process to extract executable robot actions. We evaluate task-level generalization through third-party selected tasks in the wild and real-robot experiments, demonstrating successful physical execution. Together, these results show robust instruction following, strong generalization, and real-world feasibility. We release both the model and dataset to support open, reproducible video-based robot learning. Our website is available at https://www.boyuan.space/large-video-planner/.

TL;DR: SORS is a high-fidelity FEM-based simulator for soft robots that handles large deformations, material incompressibility, and contact interactions using constrained nonlinear optimization, validated through real-world experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robotic simulators struggle with modeling soft robots' unique challenges like large nonlinear deformations, material incompressibility, and contact interactions in a scalable and application-relevant manner, creating a need for better simulation frameworks.

Method: Energy-based finite element method framework with modular extensions for custom materials and actuation models, integrated with constrained nonlinear optimization (sequential quadratic programming) for physically consistent contact handling.

Result: Validated through diverse real-world experiments including cantilever deflection, pressure-actuation of soft robotic arm, PokeFlex dataset contact interactions, and control optimization of soft robotic leg, showing high physical fidelity.

Conclusion: SORS bridges the sim-to-real gap for soft robots, providing an extensible, high-fidelity tool for prototyping next-generation soft robots with validated physical accuracy.

Abstract: The deployment of complex soft robots in multiphysics environments requires advanced simulation frameworks that not only capture interactions between different types of material, but also translate accurately to real-world performance. Soft robots pose unique modeling challenges due to their large nonlinear deformations, material incompressibility, and contact interactions, which complicate both numerical stability and physical accuracy. Despite recent progress, robotic simulators often struggle with modeling such phenomena in a scalable and application-relevant manner. We present SORS (Soft Over Rigid Simulator), a versatile, high-fidelity simulator designed to handle these complexities for soft robot applications. Our energy-based framework, built on the finite element method, allows modular extensions, enabling the inclusion of custom-designed material and actuation models. To ensure physically consistent contact handling, we integrate a constrained nonlinear optimization based on sequential quadratic programming, allowing for stable and accurate modeling of contact phenomena. We validate our simulator through a diverse set of real-world experiments, which include cantilever deflection, pressure-actuation of a soft robotic arm, and contact interactions from the PokeFlex dataset. In addition, we showcase the potential of our framework for control optimization of a soft robotic leg. These tests confirm that our simulator can capture both fundamental material behavior and complex actuation dynamics with high physical fidelity. By bridging the sim-to-real gap in these challenging domains, our approach provides a validated tool for prototyping next-generation soft robots, filling the gap of extensibility, fidelity, and usability in the soft robotic ecosystem.

*Jack Naylor,Raghav Mishra,Nicholas H. Barbara,Donald G. Dansereau*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ∂LITE is a differentiable simulation pipeline for optimizing on-orbit inspection trajectories to improve image quality by accounting for lighting challenges in LEO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual inspection of satellites in LEO faces unique challenges: specular reflections, self-shadowing, dynamic lighting, and relative motion between spacecraft, all impacting data quality. Current simulation-based planning doesn't optimize for visual data quality.

Method: ∂LITE uses end-to-end differentiable simulation combining differentiable rendering tools with a custom orbit propagator to optimize orbital parameters based on visual sensor data quality.

Result: The system automatically designs non-obvious inspection trajectories that significantly improve the quality and usefulness of captured visual data compared to conventional approaches.

Conclusion: ∂LITE represents the first differentiable inspection-planning pipeline for spacecraft, offering new computational approaches to mission planning by optimizing for visual data quality in challenging LEO conditions.

Abstract: Visual inspection of space-borne assets is of increasing interest to spacecraft operators looking to plan maintenance, characterise damage, and extend the life of high-value satellites in orbit. The environment of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) presents unique challenges when planning inspection operations that maximise visibility, information, and data quality. Specular reflection of sunlight from spacecraft bodies, self-shadowing, and dynamic lighting in LEO significantly impact the quality of data captured throughout an orbit. This is exacerbated by the relative motion between spacecraft, which introduces variable imaging distances and attitudes during inspection. Planning inspection trajectories with the aide of simulation is a common approach. However, the ability to design and optimise an inspection trajectory specifically to improve the resulting image quality in proximity operations remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present $\partial$LITE, an end-to-end differentiable simulation pipeline for on-orbit inspection operations. We leverage state-of-the-art differentiable rendering tools and a custom orbit propagator to enable end-to-end optimisation of orbital parameters based on visual sensor data. $\partial$LITE enables us to automatically design non-obvious trajectories, vastly improving the quality and usefulness of attained data. To our knowledge, our differentiable inspection-planning pipeline is the first of its kind and provides new insights into modern computational approaches to spacecraft mission planning.

*Qiping Zhang,Nathan Tsoi,Mofeed Nagib,Hao-Tien Lewis Chiang,Marynel Vázquez*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LLMs outperform traditional supervised learning in predicting human perceptions of robot performance using few-shot learning, requiring far less labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for evaluating robot behavior require extensive user studies or large labeled datasets, limiting practical deployment. There's a need for scalable approaches that can predict human perceptions of robot performance with minimal data.

Method: Proposed using LLMs' few-shot learning capabilities to predict human perceptions of robot performance in social navigation tasks. Extended SEAN TOGETHER dataset with additional real-world human-robot navigation episodes and participant feedback. Evaluated LLMs using in-context examples based on spatio-temporal cues of robot and human motion.

Result: LLMs matched or exceeded traditional supervised learning models while requiring an order of magnitude fewer labeled instances. Performance improved with more in-context examples. Ablation studies revealed which sensor-based information LLMs rely on. Personalized examples (from same user) further enhanced prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: LLM-based few-shot learning provides a scalable approach to predict human perceptions of robot performance with minimal labeled data, enabling user-centered feedback for improving robot behavior in social navigation tasks.

Abstract: Understanding how humans evaluate robot behavior during human-robot interactions is crucial for developing socially aware robots that behave according to human expectations. While the traditional approach to capturing these evaluations is to conduct a user study, recent work has proposed utilizing machine learning instead. However, existing data-driven methods require large amounts of labeled data, which limits their use in practice. To address this gap, we propose leveraging the few-shot learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve how well a robot can predict a user's perception of its performance, and study this idea experimentally in social navigation tasks. To this end, we extend the SEAN TOGETHER dataset with additional real-world human-robot navigation episodes and participant feedback. Using this augmented dataset, we evaluate the ability of several LLMs to predict human perceptions of robot performance from a small number of in-context examples, based on observed spatio-temporal cues of the robot and surrounding human motion. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can match or exceed the performance of traditional supervised learning models while requiring an order of magnitude fewer labeled instances. We further show that prediction performance can improve with more in-context examples, confirming the scalability of our approach. Additionally, we investigate what kind of sensor-based information an LLM relies on to make these inferences by conducting an ablation study on the input features considered for performance prediction. Finally, we explore the novel application of personalized examples for in-context learning, i.e., drawn from the same user being evaluated, finding that they further enhance prediction accuracy. This work paves the path to improving robot behavior in a scalable manner through user-centered feedback.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need to transport payloads through environments with unknown and uneven inclinations while maintaining desired payload orientation, which is challenging for conventional systems

Method: Custom robots with linear actuators (pistons) monitor payload orientation and compute required piston heights; uses open-loop controller coupled with closed-loop PID controller; no assumptions about terrain type

Result: System successfully maintains payload orientation on various simulated environments with varied and complex terrains, demonstrating efficacy of proposed controller

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid control approach enables robust payload transport with orientation maintenance on any unknown and uneven terrains without terrain-specific assumptions

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a multi robot payload transport system to carry payloads through an environment of unknown and uneven inclinations while maintaining the desired orientation of the payload. For this task, we used custom built robots with a linear actuator (pistons) mounted on top of each robot. The system continuously monitors the payload's orientation and computes the required piston height of each robot to maintain the desired orientation of the payload. In this work, we propose an open loop controller coupled with a closed loop PID controller to achieve the goal. As our modelling makes no assumptions on the type of terrain, the system can work on any unknown and uneven terrains and inclinations. We showcase the efficacy of our proposed controller by testing it on various simulated environments with varied and complex terrains.

TL;DR: SWIFT-Nav is a TD3-based UAV navigation framework that combines fuzzy logic safety rules with prioritized experience replay and decaying exploration to achieve stable, obstacle-aware navigation in cluttered environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient and reliable UAV navigation in cluttered and dynamic environments remains challenging, requiring systems that can achieve fast, stable convergence to obstacle-aware paths while maintaining real-time responsiveness.

Method: The system couples a sensor-driven perception front-end (LiDAR to confidence-weighted safety map and goal cues) with a TD3 waypoint policy trained with Prioritised Experience Replay and decaying epsilon-greedy exploration. A fuzzy-logic layer computes safety scores, gates mode switching, and clamps unsafe actions, while task-aligned reward shaping combines goal progress, clearance, and switch-economy terms.

Result: The approach consistently outperforms baselines in trajectory smoothness and generalization to unseen layouts while preserving real-time responsiveness in Webots simulations with proximity-based collision checking.

Conclusion: Combining TD3 with replay prioritisation, calibrated exploration, and fuzzy-safety rules yields a robust and deployable solution for UAV navigation in cluttered scenes.

Abstract: Efficient and reliable UAV navigation in cluttered and dynamic environments remains challenging. We propose SWIFT-Nav: Stability-aware Waypoint-level Integration of Fuzzy arbitration and TD3 for Navigation, a TD3-based navigation framework that achieves fast, stable convergence to obstacle-aware paths. The system couples a sensor-driven perception front end with a TD3 waypoint policy: the perception module converts LiDAR ranges into a confidence-weighted safety map and goal cues, while the TD3 policy is trained with Prioritised Experience Replay to focus on high-error transitions and a decaying epsilon-greedy exploration schedule that gradually shifts from exploration to exploitation. A lightweight fuzzy-logic layer computes a safety score from radial measurements and near obstacles, gates mode switching and clamps unsafe actions; in parallel, task-aligned reward shaping combining goal progress, clearance, and switch-economy terms provides dense, well-scaled feedback that accelerates learning. Implemented in Webots with proximity-based collision checking, our approach consistently outperforms baselines in trajectory smoothness and generalization to unseen layouts, while preserving real-time responsiveness. These results show that combining TD3 with replay prioritisation, calibrated exploration, and fuzzy-safety rules yields a robust and deployable solution for UAV navigation in cluttered scenes.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A unified framework for co-optimizing modular manipulator morphology, mounted pose, and motion planning using HMPC and CMA-ES, with bi-branch designs to extend workspace without stronger modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modular manipulators need feasible motion generation while optimizing morphology and pose under constraints. Traditional single-branch designs extend reach by increasing link length, which violates torque limits at base joints.

Method: Proposed unified task-driven framework with hierarchical MPC for motion planning across morphologies. Uses CMA-ES to optimize discrete morphology configurations and continuous mounted poses. Introduces virtual module abstraction for bi-branch morphologies where auxiliary branch offloads torque from primary branch.

Result: Framework generates multiple feasible designs satisfying kinematic/dynamic constraints while avoiding collisions. Customizable cost functions achieve objectives like maximizing manipulability, minimizing joint effort, or reducing module count. Bi-branch morphology enables large workspace operation without requiring more powerful basic modules.

Conclusion: The proposed computational framework effectively solves the joint optimization problem of morphology, pose, and motion for modular manipulators, with bi-branch designs offering torque offloading benefits for extended workspaces.

Abstract: Modular manipulators composed of pre-manufactured and interchangeable modules offer high adaptability across diverse tasks. However, their deployment requires generating feasible motions while jointly optimizing morphology and mounted pose under kinematic, dynamic, and physical constraints. Moreover, traditional single-branch designs often extend reach by increasing link length, which can easily violate torque limits at the base joint. To address these challenges, we propose a unified task-driven computational framework that integrates trajectory planning across varying morphologies with the co-optimization of morphology and mounted pose. Within this framework, a hierarchical model predictive control (HMPC) strategy is developed to enable motion planning for both redundant and non-redundant manipulators. For design optimization, the CMA-ES is employed to efficiently explore a hybrid search space consisting of discrete morphology configurations and continuous mounted poses. Meanwhile, a virtual module abstraction is introduced to enable bi-branch morphologies, allowing an auxiliary branch to offload torque from the primary branch and extend the achievable workspace without increasing the capacity of individual joint modules. Extensive simulations and hardware experiments on polishing, drilling, and pick-and-place tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The results show that: 1) the framework can generate multiple feasible designs that satisfy kinematic and dynamic constraints while avoiding environmental collisions for given tasks; 2) flexible design objectives, such as maximizing manipulability, minimizing joint effort, or reducing the number of modules, can be achieved by customizing the cost functions; and 3) a bi-branch morphology capable of operating in a large workspace can be realized without requiring more powerful basic modules.

Result: Method improves interaction replication accuracy by 83.53%, boosts calibration efficiency by 76.75%, and maintains accuracy across vehicle-level and traffic flow-level metrics with 51.9% improvement. Outperforms baseline (no calibration) and state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed automated calibration method effectively addresses limitations of existing approaches by providing high accuracy at both vehicle and traffic flow levels while significantly improving efficiency, enabling more reliable AV simulation testing.

Abstract: Simulation testing is a fundamental approach for evaluating automated vehicles (AVs). To ensure its reliability, it is crucial to accurately replicate interactions between AVs and background traffic, which necessitates effective calibration. However, existing calibration methods often fall short in achieving this goal. To address this gap, this study introduces a simulation platform calibration method that ensures high accuracy at both the vehicle and traffic flow levels. The method offers several key features:(1) with the capability of calibration for vehicle-to-vehicle interaction; (2) with accuracy assurance; (3) with enhanced efficiency; (4) with pipeline calibration capability. The proposed method is benchmarked against a baseline with no calibration and a state-of-the-art calibration method. Results show that it enhances the accuracy of interaction replication by 83.53% and boosts calibration efficiency by 76.75%. Furthermore, it maintains accuracy across both vehicle-level and traffic flow-level metrics, with an improvement of 51.9%. Notably, the entire calibration process is fully automated, requiring no human intervention.

*Zixuan Chen,Chongkai Gao,Lin Shao,Jieqi Shi,Jing Huo,Yang Gao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ManiLong-Shot enables one-shot imitation learning for long-horizon manipulation tasks by decomposing them into interaction-aware primitives, achieving 22.8% improvement over SOTA with strong real-world performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current one-shot imitation learning methods are limited to short-horizon tasks, restricting their applicability to complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks that require sequencing multiple actions over extended periods.

Method: Decomposes long-horizon tasks into interaction-aware primitives based on physical interaction events, using either VLM reasoning or rule-based heuristics. For each primitive, predicts invariant regions, establishes correspondences between demonstration and observation, and computes target end-effector poses.

Result: Trained on only 10 short-horizon tasks, generalizes to 20 unseen long-horizon tasks across three difficulty levels with 22.8% relative improvement over SOTA. Real-robot experiments validate robust execution of three long-horizon manipulation tasks via one-shot imitation.

Conclusion: ManiLong-Shot successfully extends one-shot imitation learning to long-horizon manipulation tasks through primitive decomposition and interaction-aware reasoning, demonstrating practical applicability in both simulation and real-world scenarios.

Abstract: One-shot imitation learning (OSIL) offers a promising way to teach robots new skills without large-scale data collection. However, current OSIL methods are primarily limited to short-horizon tasks, thus limiting their applicability to complex, long-horizon manipulations. To address this limitation, we propose ManiLong-Shot, a novel framework that enables effective OSIL for long-horizon prehensile manipulation tasks. ManiLong-Shot structures long-horizon tasks around physical interaction events, reframing the problem as sequencing interaction-aware primitives instead of directly imitating continuous trajectories. This primitive decomposition can be driven by high-level reasoning from a vision-language model (VLM) or by rule-based heuristics derived from robot state changes. For each primitive, ManiLong-Shot predicts invariant regions critical to the interaction, establishes correspondences between the demonstration and the current observation, and computes the target end-effector pose, enabling effective task execution. Extensive simulation experiments show that ManiLong-Shot, trained on only 10 short-horizon tasks, generalizes to 20 unseen long-horizon tasks across three difficulty levels via one-shot imitation, achieving a 22.8% relative improvement over the SOTA. Additionally, real-robot experiments validate ManiLong-Shot's ability to robustly execute three long-horizon manipulation tasks via OSIL, confirming its practical applicability.

*Sijia Chen,Wei Dong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Ground-aerial collaborative system improves flying robot localization in cluttered environments using active vision, single-ranging, and adaptive sensor fusion to handle visual degradation and capture failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional fixed-camera approaches for flying robot localization have limitations: constrained distance, susceptibility to capture failure, and poor performance in cluttered environments with visual degradation (smoke, illumination changes, occlusion).

Method: 1) Active vision subsystem on ground vehicle with rotating camera to track infrared markers on aerial robot; 2) Single-ranging integration to extend distance and improve re-capture; 3) Dimension-reduced estimator using polynomial approximation with extended sliding window; 4) Adaptive sliding confidence evaluation algorithm to dynamically adjust measurement weights based on moving variance.

Result: Extensive experiments show robust online localization with average RMSE of ~0.09m under challenging conditions: smoke interference, illumination variation, obstacle occlusion, prolonged visual loss, and extended operating range. System maintains resilience to capture loss and sensor failures.

Conclusion: The comprehensive ground-aerial collaborative framework effectively enhances localization robustness for flying robots in cluttered environments by integrating active vision, single-ranging, and adaptive sensor fusion, overcoming limitations of conventional fixed-camera approaches.

Abstract: It's a practical approach using the ground-aerial collaborative system to enhance the localization robustness of flying robots in cluttered environments, especially when visual sensors degrade. Conventional approaches estimate the flying robot's position using fixed cameras observing pre-attached markers, which could be constrained by limited distance and susceptible to capture failure. To address this issue, we improve the ground-aerial localization framework in a more comprehensive manner, which integrates active vision, single-ranging, inertial odometry, and optical flow. First, the designed active vision subsystem mounted on the ground vehicle can be dynamically rotated to detect and track infrared markers on the aerial robot, improving the field of view and the target recognition with a single camera. Meanwhile, the incorporation of single-ranging extends the feasible distance and enhances re-capture capability under visual degradation. During estimation, a dimension-reduced estimator fuses multi-source measurements based on polynomial approximation with an extended sliding window, balancing computational efficiency and redundancy. Considering different sensor fidelities, an adaptive sliding confidence evaluation algorithm is implemented to assess measurement quality and dynamically adjust the weighting parameters based on moving variance. Finally, extensive experiments under conditions such as smoke interference, illumination variation, obstacle occlusion, prolonged visual loss, and extended operating range demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves robust online localization, with an average root mean square error of approximately 0.09 m, while maintaining resilience to capture loss and sensor failures.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: E-SDS framework uses vision-language models with terrain perception to automate reward design for humanoid locomotion, enabling successful stair descent and reducing velocity tracking errors by 51.9-82.6%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM-based methods for automating reward design in humanoid locomotion lack environmental perception needed for complex terrain navigation, requiring tedious manual engineering.

Method: E-SDS integrates vision-language models with real-time terrain sensor analysis to automatically generate reward functions for training robust perceptive locomotion policies, using example videos as grounding.

Result: E-SDS uniquely enabled successful stair descent on Unitree G1 humanoid across four terrains, while manual and non-perceptive baselines failed. Reduced velocity tracking error by 51.9-82.6% and cut reward design time from days to under 2 hours.

Conclusion: E-SDS closes the perception gap in automated reward design, producing more robust locomotion policies with significantly reduced human effort while enabling navigation of complex terrains like stairs.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) show promise in automating reward design in humanoid locomotion, which could eliminate the need for tedious manual engineering. However, current VLM-based methods are essentially "blind", as they lack the environmental perception required to navigate complex terrain. We present E-SDS (Environment-aware See it, Do it, Sorted), a framework that closes this perception gap. E-SDS integrates VLMs with real-time terrain sensor analysis to automatically generate reward functions that facilitate training of robust perceptive locomotion policies, grounded by example videos. Evaluated on a Unitree G1 humanoid across four distinct terrains (simple, gaps, obstacles, stairs), E-SDS uniquely enabled successful stair descent, while policies trained with manually-designed rewards or a non-perceptive automated baseline were unable to complete the task. In all terrains, E-SDS also reduced velocity tracking error by 51.9-82.6%. Our framework reduces the human effort of reward design from days to less than two hours while simultaneously producing more robust and capable locomotion policies.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Using diffusion models for 3D shape completion from single-view depth to improve grasp planning in cluttered scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single camera views provide incomplete geometry due to occlusion and limited perspective, leading to suboptimal grasp estimation in cluttered environments.

Method: Leverage diffusion models for category-level 3D shape completion from partial depth observations, generating complete object geometries for downstream grasp planning networks.

Result: In cluttered scene evaluations, approach improves grasp success rates by 23% over baseline without shape completion and 19% over recent state-of-the-art shape completion methods.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based shape completion provides richer geometric context that significantly improves grasp planning performance in realistic cluttered environments with household objects.

Abstract: In vision-based robot manipulation, a single camera view can only capture one side of objects of interest, with additional occlusions in cluttered scenes further restricting visibility. As a result, the observed geometry is incomplete, and grasp estimation algorithms perform suboptimally. To address this limitation, we leverage diffusion models to perform category-level 3D shape completion from partial depth observations obtained from a single view, reconstructing complete object geometries to provide richer context for grasp planning. Our method focuses on common household items with diverse geometries, generating full 3D shapes that serve as input to downstream grasp inference networks. Unlike prior work, which primarily considers isolated objects or minimal clutter, we evaluate shape completion and grasping in realistic clutter scenarios with household objects. In preliminary evaluations on a cluttered scene, our approach consistently results in better grasp success rates than a naive baseline without shape completion by 23% and over a recent state of the art shape completion approach by 19%.

Abstract: As unmanned systems such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) become increasingly important to applications like urban sensing and emergency response, efficiently recruiting these autonomous devices to perform time-sensitive tasks has become a critical challenge. This paper presents MPBS (Mobility-aware Prediction and Behavior-based Scheduling), a scalable task recruitment framework that treats each device as a recruitable "user". MPBS integrates three key modules: a behavior-aware KNN classifier, a time-varying Markov prediction model for forecasting device mobility, and a dynamic priority scheduling mechanism that considers task urgency and base station performance. By combining behavioral classification with spatiotemporal prediction, MPBS adaptively assigns tasks to the most suitable devices in real time. Experimental evaluations on the real-world GeoLife dataset show that MPBS significantly improves task completion efficiency and resource utilization. The proposed framework offers a predictive, behavior-aware solution for intelligent and collaborative scheduling in unmanned systems.

Conclusion: Tri-Select effectively addresses redundancy and quality issues in mobile visual crowdsensing, making it suitable for scalable environmental monitoring applications.

Abstract: Mobile visual crowdsensing enables large-scale, fine-grained environmental monitoring through the collection of images from distributed mobile devices. However, the resulting data is often redundant and heterogeneous due to overlapping acquisition perspectives, varying resolutions, and diverse user behaviors. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Tri-Select, a multi-stage visual data selection framework that efficiently filters redundant and low-quality images. Tri-Select operates in three stages: (1) metadata-based filtering to discard irrelevant samples; (2) spatial similarity-based spectral clustering to organize candidate images; and (3) a visual-feature-guided selection based on maximum independent set search to retain high-quality, representative images. Experiments on real-world and public datasets demonstrate that Tri-Select improves both selection efficiency and dataset quality, making it well-suited for scalable crowdsensing applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bring animated characters with non-physical proportions and movements to life in the physical world, requiring innovation in both mechanical design and stylized motion control for believable robotic characters.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning guided by animation references for control, custom mechanical design with hidden asymmetric legs under foam skirt, spherical/planar linkages for arms/mouth/eyes, and thermal-aware policies with temperature inputs and rewards to prevent overheating.

Result: Successfully validated in simulation and hardware, achieving unmatched level of believability for a costumed robotic character with reduced impact noise and prevented actuator overheating.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates successful physical realization of animated characters through combined innovations in reinforcement learning control, mechanical design, and thermal-aware policies, enabling believable robotic characters with non-physical proportions.

Abstract: Animated characters often move in non-physical ways and have proportions that are far from a typical walking robot. This provides an ideal platform for innovation in both mechanical design and stylized motion control. In this paper, we bring Olaf to life in the physical world, relying on reinforcement learning guided by animation references for control. To create the illusion of Olaf's feet moving along his body, we hide two asymmetric legs under a soft foam skirt. To fit actuators inside the character, we use spherical and planar linkages in the arms, mouth, and eyes. Because the walk cycle results in harsh contact sounds, we introduce additional rewards that noticeably reduce impact noise. The large head, driven by small actuators in the character's slim neck, creates a risk of overheating, amplified by the costume. To keep actuators from overheating, we feed temperature values as additional inputs to policies, introducing new rewards to keep them within bounds. We validate the efficacy of our modeling in simulation and on hardware, demonstrating an unmatched level of believability for a costumed robotic character.

Conclusion: VERM effectively filters redundant multi-camera information, captures necessary task-relevant features, mitigates occlusion, and enables efficient 3D action planning for robotic manipulation.

Abstract: When performing 3D manipulation tasks, robots have to execute action planning based on perceptions from multiple fixed cameras. The multi-camera setup introduces substantial redundancy and irrelevant information, which increases computational costs and forces the model to spend extra training time extracting crucial task-relevant details. To filter out redundant information and accurately extract task-relevant features, we propose the VERM (Virtual Eye for Robotic Manipulation) method, leveraging the knowledge in foundation models to imagine a virtual task-adaptive view from the constructed 3D point cloud, which efficiently captures necessary information and mitigates occlusion. To facilitate 3D action planning and fine-grained manipulation, we further design a depth-aware module and a dynamic coarse-to-fine procedure. Extensive experimental results on both simulation benchmark RLBench and real-world evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods while achieving 1.89x speedup in training time and 1.54x speedup in inference speed.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Survey paper categorizing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks for autonomous driving, tracing evolution from Vision-Action models and organizing methods into End-to-End vs Dual-System paradigms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional modular "Perception-Decision-Action" pipelines have limitations: hand-crafted interfaces break down in complex scenarios, rule-based components fail in long-tailed cases, and cascaded designs propagate perception errors. Vision-Action models lack interpretability, robustness to distribution shifts, and structured reasoning capabilities. Recent LLM and multimodal advances enable more integrated, interpretable approaches.

Method: Structured characterization and taxonomy of VLA frameworks. Two main paradigms: 1) End-to-End VLA (single model integrating perception, reasoning, planning), and 2) Dual-System VLA (separates slow deliberation via VLMs from fast safety-critical execution via planners). Further subclassifies into textual vs. numerical action generators and explicit vs. implicit guidance mechanisms.

Result: Comprehensive survey organizing the emerging VLA landscape, establishing coherent foundation for advancing human-compatible autonomous driving. Identifies key paradigms, subclasses, representative datasets, benchmarks, and evaluation approaches for VLA-based driving systems.

Conclusion: VLA frameworks offer promising pathway toward more interpretable, generalizable, and human-aligned driving policies by unifying visual understanding, linguistic reasoning, and actionable outputs. Key challenges remain in robustness, interpretability, and instruction fidelity, but VLAs represent significant advancement over traditional modular pipelines and Vision-Action models.

Abstract: Autonomous driving has long relied on modular "Perception-Decision-Action" pipelines, where hand-crafted interfaces and rule-based components often break down in complex or long-tailed scenarios. Their cascaded design further propagates perception errors, degrading downstream planning and control. Vision-Action (VA) models address some limitations by learning direct mappings from visual inputs to actions, but they remain opaque, sensitive to distribution shifts, and lack structured reasoning or instruction-following capabilities. Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal learning has motivated the emergence of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks, which integrate perception with language-grounded decision making. By unifying visual understanding, linguistic reasoning, and actionable outputs, VLAs offer a pathway toward more interpretable, generalizable, and human-aligned driving policies. This work provides a structured characterization of the emerging VLA landscape for autonomous driving. We trace the evolution from early VA approaches to modern VLA frameworks and organize existing methods into two principal paradigms: End-to-End VLA, which integrates perception, reasoning, and planning within a single model, and Dual-System VLA, which separates slow deliberation (via VLMs) from fast, safety-critical execution (via planners). Within these paradigms, we further distinguish subclasses such as textual vs. numerical action generators and explicit vs. implicit guidance mechanisms. We also summarize representative datasets and benchmarks for evaluating VLA-based driving systems and highlight key challenges and open directions, including robustness, interpretability, and instruction fidelity. Overall, this work aims to establish a coherent foundation for advancing human-compatible autonomous driving systems.

TL;DR: E2E-3M dataset converts human egocentric videos into structured VQA supervision for training PhysBrain, enabling better egocentric understanding and more efficient robot control learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic generalization requires physical intelligence with egocentric perception, but VLMs are trained on third-person data. Human egocentric videos offer scalable, rich interaction data but need structured conversion for robot training.

Method: Proposed Egocentric2Embodiment translation pipeline that transforms first-person videos into multi-level, schema-driven VQA supervision with evidence grounding and temporal consistency, creating the E2E-3M dataset.

Result: PhysBrain trained on E2E-3M shows improved egocentric understanding (planning on EgoThink), enables more sample-efficient VLA fine-tuning, and achieves 53.9% success rate on SimplerEnv.

Conclusion: Human egocentric videos can be effectively translated into embodiment training supervision, enabling transfer of human interaction knowledge to downstream robot control tasks.

Abstract: Robotic generalization relies on physical intelligence: the ability to reason about state changes, contact-rich interactions, and long-horizon planning under egocentric perception and action. However, most VLMs are trained primarily on third-person data, creating a fundamental viewpoint mismatch for humanoid robots. Scaling robot egocentric data collection remains impractical due to high cost and limited diversity, whereas large-scale human egocentric videos offer a scalable alternative that naturally capture rich interaction context and causal structure. The key challenge is to convert raw egocentric videos into structured and reliable embodiment training supervision. Accordingly, we propose an Egocentric2Embodiment translation pipeline that transforms first-person videos into multi-level, schema-driven VQA supervision with enforced evidence grounding and temporal consistency, enabling the construction of the Egocentric2Embodiment dataset (E2E-3M) at scale. An egocentric-aware embodied brain, termed PhysBrain, is obtained by training on the E2E-3M dataset. PhysBrain exhibits substantially improved egocentric understanding, particularly for planning on EgoThink. It provides an egocentric-aware initialization that enables more sample-efficient VLA fine-tuning and higher SimplerEnv success rates (53.9\%), demonstrating effective transfer from human egocentric supervision to downstream robot control.

Conclusion: ReinforceGen demonstrates an effective approach combining decomposition, imitation learning, and reinforcement learning for long-horizon manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Long-horizon manipulation has been a long-standing challenge in the robotics community. We propose ReinforceGen, a system that combines task decomposition, data generation, imitation learning, and motion planning to form an initial solution, and improves each component through reinforcement-learning-based fine-tuning. ReinforceGen first segments the task into multiple localized skills, which are connected through motion planning. The skills and motion planning targets are trained with imitation learning on a dataset generated from 10 human demonstrations, and then fine-tuned through online adaptation and reinforcement learning. When benchmarked on the Robosuite dataset, ReinforceGen reaches 80% success rate on all tasks with visuomotor controls in the highest reset range setting. Additional ablation studies show that our fine-tuning approaches contributes to an 89% average performance increase. More results and videos available in https://reinforcegen.github.io/

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Benchmarking robot policies is challenging due to real-world stochasticity, reproducibility issues, and time-consuming rollouts. Existing simulation benchmarks have unreliable visual/physical domain gaps, and building realistic simulated environments requires significant human effort.

Method: PolaRiS uses neural reconstruction methods to convert short video scans of real-world scenes into interactive simulation environments. It also employs simulation data co-training to bridge remaining real-to-sim gaps and enable zero-shot evaluation in unseen simulation environments.

Result: Extensive paired evaluations show PolaRiS provides much stronger correlation to real-world generalist policy performance than existing simulated benchmarks. The framework enables rapid creation of diverse simulated environments.

Conclusion: PolaRiS takes a step toward distributed and democratized evaluation for robotic foundation models by providing a scalable, high-fidelity simulation framework that accurately reflects real-world policy performance.

Abstract: A significant challenge for robot learning research is our ability to accurately measure and compare the performance of robot policies. Benchmarking in robotics is historically challenging due to the stochasticity, reproducibility, and time-consuming nature of real-world rollouts. This challenge is exacerbated for recent generalist policies, which has to be evaluated across a wide variety of scenes and tasks. Evaluation in simulation offers a scalable complement to real world evaluations, but the visual and physical domain gap between existing simulation benchmarks and the real world has made them an unreliable signal for policy improvement. Furthermore, building realistic and diverse simulated environments has traditionally required significant human effort and expertise. To bridge the gap, we introduce Policy Evaluation and Environment Reconstruction in Simulation (PolaRiS), a scalable real-to-sim framework for high-fidelity simulated robot evaluation. PolaRiS utilizes neural reconstruction methods to turn short video scans of real-world scenes into interactive simulation environments. Additionally, we develop a simple simulation data co-training recipe that bridges remaining real-to-sim gaps and enables zero-shot evaluation in unseen simulation environments. Through extensive paired evaluations between simulation and the real world, we demonstrate that PolaRiS evaluations provide a much stronger correlation to real world generalist policy performance than existing simulated benchmarks. Its simplicity also enables rapid creation of diverse simulated environments. As such, this work takes a step towards distributed and democratized evaluation for the next generation of robotic foundation models.

Result: Achieves at least 234x speed-up over Scene Synthesizer and provides collision-free scene variations with optional robot manipulation feasibility checks.

Conclusion: Sceniris enables rapid generation of large-scale synthetic 3D scenes for Physical AI and generative models, overcoming previous throughput limitations.

Abstract: Synthetic 3D scenes are essential for developing Physical AI and generative models. Existing procedural generation methods often have low output throughput, creating a significant bottleneck in scaling up dataset creation. In this work, we introduce Sceniris, a highly efficient procedural scene generation framework for rapidly generating large-scale, collision-free scene variations. Sceniris also provides an optional robot reachability check, providing manipulation-feasible scenes for robot tasks. Sceniris is designed for maximum efficiency by addressing the primary performance limitations of the prior method, Scene Synthesizer. Leveraging batch sampling and faster collision checking in cuRobo, Sceniris achieves at least 234x speed-up over Scene Synthesizer. Sceniris also expands the object-wise spatial relationships available in prior work to support diverse scene requirements. Our code is available at https://github.com/rai-inst/sceniris
