### [2] [Oracle-RLAIF: An Improved Fine-Tuning Framework for Multi-modal Video Models through Reinforcement Learning from Ranking Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02561)
*Derek Shi,Ruben Glatt,Christine Klymko,Shubham Mohole,Hongjun Choi,Shashank Kushwaha,Sam Sakla,Felipe Leno da Silva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Oracle-RLAIF is a novel framework that replaces expensive trained reward models with a general Oracle ranker for video-language models, using rank-based optimization instead of scalar scoring to reduce costs while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLAIF frameworks require expensive specialized reward models trained with video narratives, making fine-tuning costly and restrictive as video-language models scale in size.

Method: Proposes Oracle-RLAIF framework with Oracle ranker that ranks candidate responses instead of scoring them, and introduces $GRPO_{rank}$ - a rank-based loss function using Group Relative Policy Optimization with rank-aware advantages.

Result: Oracle-RLAIF consistently outperforms leading VLMs using existing fine-tuning methods across various video comprehension benchmarks.

Conclusion: Oracle-RLAIF enables flexible and data-efficient frameworks for aligning large multi-modal video models using reinforcement learning from rank rather than score.

Abstract: Recent advances in large video-language models (VLMs) rely on extensive
fine-tuning techniques that strengthen alignment between textual and visual
comprehension. Leading pipelines typically pair supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
with reinforcement learning from preference data to enhance video
comprehension. However, as VLMs scale in parameter size, so does the cost of
gathering enough human feedback. To make fine-tuning more cost-effective,
recent frameworks explore reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF),
which replace human preference with AI as a judge. Current RLAIF frameworks
rely on a specialized reward model trained with video narratives to create
calibrated scalar rewards -- an expensive and restrictive pipeline. We propose
Oracle-RLAIF, a novel framework that replaces the trained reward model with a
more general Oracle ranker which acts as a drop-in model ranking candidate
model responses rather than scoring them. Alongside Oracle-RLAIF, we introduce
$GRPO_{rank}$, a novel rank-based loss function based on Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) that directly optimizes ordinal feedback with rank-aware
advantages. Empirically, we demonstrate that Oracle-RLAIF consistently
outperforms leading VLMs using existing fine-tuning methods when evaluated
across various video comprehension benchmarks. Oracle-RLAIF paves the path to
creating flexible and data-efficient frameworks for aligning large multi-modal
video models with reinforcement learning from rank rather than score.

### [3] [PhysHMR: Learning Humanoid Control Policies from Vision for Physically Plausible Human Motion Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02566)
*Qiao Feng,Yiming Huang,Yufu Wang,Jiatao Gu,Lingjie Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysHMR is a unified framework that directly learns a visual-to-action policy for humanoid control in physics simulation, enabling physically plausible human motion reconstruction from monocular videos without the error accumulation of traditional two-stage methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for human motion reconstruction from monocular videos rely on kinematics-based pose estimation followed by physics-based post-processing, which introduces error accumulation and limits reconstruction quality due to the lack of physical constraints in the initial stage.

Method: The approach uses a pixel-as-ray strategy to lift 2D keypoints into 3D spatial rays in global space, combined with local visual features from a pretrained encoder. It employs a distillation scheme to transfer motion knowledge from a mocap-trained expert to the vision-conditioned policy, refined using physically motivated reinforcement learning rewards.

Result: Extensive experiments show that PhysHMR produces high-fidelity, physically plausible motion across diverse scenarios, outperforming prior approaches in both visual accuracy and physical realism.

Conclusion: PhysHMR successfully addresses the limitations of traditional two-stage methods by providing a unified framework that directly learns physically grounded motion reconstruction from visual inputs, achieving superior results in both physical plausibility and visual alignment.

Abstract: Reconstructing physically plausible human motion from monocular videos
remains a challenging problem in computer vision and graphics. Existing methods
primarily focus on kinematics-based pose estimation, often leading to
unrealistic results due to the lack of physical constraints. To address such
artifacts, prior methods have typically relied on physics-based post-processing
following the initial kinematics-based motion estimation. However, this
two-stage design introduces error accumulation, ultimately limiting the overall
reconstruction quality. In this paper, we present PhysHMR, a unified framework
that directly learns a visual-to-action policy for humanoid control in a
physics-based simulator, enabling motion reconstruction that is both physically
grounded and visually aligned with the input video. A key component of our
approach is the pixel-as-ray strategy, which lifts 2D keypoints into 3D spatial
rays and transforms them into global space. These rays are incorporated as
policy inputs, providing robust global pose guidance without depending on noisy
3D root predictions. This soft global grounding, combined with local visual
features from a pretrained encoder, allows the policy to reason over both
detailed pose and global positioning. To overcome the sample inefficiency of
reinforcement learning, we further introduce a distillation scheme that
transfers motion knowledge from a mocap-trained expert to the
vision-conditioned policy, which is then refined using physically motivated
reinforcement learning rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhysHMR
produces high-fidelity, physically plausible motion across diverse scenarios,
outperforming prior approaches in both visual accuracy and physical realism.

### [4] [Unlocking the power of partnership: How humans and machines can work together to improve face recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02570)
*P. Jonathon Phillips,Geraldine Jeckeln,Carina A. Hahn,Amy N. Yates,Peter C. Fontana,Alice J. O'Toole*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper examines when combining human and machine face identification decisions improves accuracy, finding that collaboration benefits increase when baseline accuracy differences between collaborators are small (Proximal Accuracy Rule). The study identifies a large "critical fusion zone" where humans less accurate than machines can still improve system accuracy through intelligent fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the circumstances under which human-machine collaboration in face identification improves accuracy, given that individual differences between people and machines can either enhance or degrade system performance.

Method: Used data from expert and non-expert face identifiers to examine human-human and human-machine collaborations. Developed the Proximal Accuracy Rule (PAR) to predict collaborative benefits and established a critical fusion zone. Implemented "intelligent human-machine fusion" by selecting humans with potential to increase machine accuracy.

Result: Found that collaborative benefits follow the Proximal Accuracy Rule - benefits increase as baseline accuracy difference between collaborators decreases. Identified a surprisingly large critical fusion zone where humans less accurate than machines can still improve system accuracy. Intelligent fusion was more accurate than machine alone or combining all human-machine judgments.

Conclusion: Both humans and machines play meaningful roles in ensuring accurate face identification. Intelligent human-machine collaboration effectively minimizes the impact of low-performing humans on system-wide accuracy, offering an evidence-based roadmap for AI use in face identification.

Abstract: Human review of consequential decisions by face recognition algorithms
creates a "collaborative" human-machine system. Individual differences between
people and machines, however, affect whether collaboration improves or degrades
accuracy in any given case. We establish the circumstances under which
combining human and machine face identification decisions improves accuracy.
Using data from expert and non-expert face identifiers, we examined the
benefits of human-human and human-machine collaborations. The benefits of
collaboration increased as the difference in baseline accuracy between
collaborators decreased-following the Proximal Accuracy Rule (PAR). This rule
predicted collaborative (fusion) benefit across a wide range of baseline
abilities, from people with no training to those with extensive training. Using
the PAR, we established a critical fusion zone, where humans are less accurate
than the machine, but fusing the two improves system accuracy. This zone was
surprisingly large. We implemented "intelligent human-machine fusion" by
selecting people with the potential to increase the accuracy of a
high-performing machine. Intelligent fusion was more accurate than the machine
operating alone and more accurate than combining all human and machine
judgments. The highest system-wide accuracy achievable with human-only
partnerships was found by graph theory. This fully human system approximated
the average performance achieved by intelligent human-machine collaboration.
However, intelligent human-machine collaboration more effectively minimized the
impact of low-performing humans on system-wide accuracy. The results
demonstrate a meaningful role for both humans and machines in assuring accurate
face identification. This study offers an evidence-based road map for the
intelligent use of AI in face identification.

### [5] [How Confident are Video Models? Empowering Video Models to Express their Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02571)
*Zhiting Mei,Ola Shorinwa,Anirudha Majumdar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first framework for uncertainty quantification in generative video models, addressing safety concerns from model hallucinations by developing metrics, methods, and datasets to measure and decompose predictive uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video generation models tend to hallucinate like LLMs, producing plausible but factually wrong videos, which raises critical safety concerns. No existing UQ methods exist for video models despite extensive work on LLM uncertainty quantification.

Method: Proposes a framework with: (1) calibration metric based on robust rank correlation estimation, (2) black-box UQ method (S-QUBED) using latent modeling to decompose uncertainty into aleatoric and epistemic components, (3) UQ dataset for benchmarking. Conditions generation in latent space to disentangle uncertainty sources.

Result: Extensive experiments show S-QUBED computes calibrated total uncertainty estimates that are negatively correlated with task accuracy and effectively decomposes uncertainty into aleatoric and epistemic constituents.

Conclusion: This work represents the first successful approach to uncertainty quantification for generative video models, providing a framework that enables safety evaluation and uncertainty decomposition for video generation systems.

Abstract: Generative video models demonstrate impressive text-to-video capabilities,
spurring widespread adoption in many real-world applications. However, like
large language models (LLMs), video generation models tend to hallucinate,
producing plausible videos even when they are factually wrong. Although
uncertainty quantification (UQ) of LLMs has been extensively studied in prior
work, no UQ method for video models exists, raising critical safety concerns.
To our knowledge, this paper represents the first work towards quantifying the
uncertainty of video models. We present a framework for uncertainty
quantification of generative video models, consisting of: (i) a metric for
evaluating the calibration of video models based on robust rank correlation
estimation with no stringent modeling assumptions; (ii) a black-box UQ method
for video models (termed S-QUBED), which leverages latent modeling to
rigorously decompose predictive uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic
components; and (iii) a UQ dataset to facilitate benchmarking calibration in
video models. By conditioning the generation task in the latent space, we
disentangle uncertainty arising due to vague task specifications from that
arising from lack of knowledge. Through extensive experiments on benchmark
video datasets, we demonstrate that S-QUBED computes calibrated total
uncertainty estimates that are negatively correlated with the task accuracy and
effectively computes the aleatoric and epistemic constituents.

### [6] [PEO: Training-Free Aesthetic Quality Enhancement in Pre-Trained Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Prompt Embedding Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02599)
*Hovhannes Margaryan,Bo Wan,Tinne Tuytelaars*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PEO is a training-free method that optimizes text embeddings in diffusion models to improve image quality from simple prompts using a tripartite objective function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance aesthetic quality in text-to-image generation from simple, uncurated prompts without requiring model retraining.

Method: Optimizes text embeddings through a tripartite objective: aesthetic fidelity, adherence to optimized embedding, and minimal divergence from original prompt via prompt preservation term.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show PEO exceeds or matches state-of-the-art methods in text-to-image generation and prompt adaptation.

Conclusion: PEO effectively improves image quality from simple prompts in a training-free, backbone-independent manner, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to aesthetic quality improvement in
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models when given a simple prompt. Our
method, dubbed Prompt Embedding Optimization (PEO), leverages a pre-trained
text-to-image diffusion model as a backbone and optimizes the text embedding of
a given simple and uncurated prompt to enhance the visual quality of the
generated image. We achieve this by a tripartite objective function that
improves the aesthetic fidelity of the generated image, ensures adherence to
the optimized text embedding, and minimal divergence from the initial prompt.
The latter is accomplished through a prompt preservation term. Additionally,
PEO is training-free and backbone-independent. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, exceeding or
equating the performance of state-of-the-art text-to-image and prompt
adaptation methods.

### [7] [Ego-Exo 3D Hand Tracking in the Wild with a Mobile Multi-Camera Rig](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02601)
*Patrick Rim,Kun He,Kevin Harris,Braden Copple,Shangchen Han,Sizhe An,Ivan Shugurov,Tomas Hodan,He Wen,Xu Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel marker-less multi-camera system for accurate 3D hand tracking in unconstrained environments, combining back-mounted exocentric cameras with a headset's egocentric views to capture realistic hand-object interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for 3D hand tracking are predominantly captured in controlled lab settings, limiting environmental diversity and model generalization to real-world scenarios.

Method: Developed a lightweight marker-less multi-camera system with eight exocentric cameras mounted on a backpack and two egocentric views from a Meta Quest 3 headset, along with an ego-exo tracking pipeline for generating accurate 3D hand pose ground truth.

Result: Created an annotated dataset with synchronized multi-view images and precise 3D hand poses that significantly reduces the trade-off between environmental realism and 3D annotation accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed system enables nearly unconstrained mobility in genuinely in-the-wild conditions, advancing the field of egocentric computer vision for hand tracking and interaction analysis.

Abstract: Accurate 3D tracking of hands and their interactions with the world in
unconstrained settings remains a significant challenge for egocentric computer
vision. With few exceptions, existing datasets are predominantly captured in
controlled lab setups, limiting environmental diversity and model
generalization. To address this, we introduce a novel marker-less multi-camera
system designed to capture precise 3D hands and objects, which allows for
nearly unconstrained mobility in genuinely in-the-wild conditions. We combine a
lightweight, back-mounted capture rig with eight exocentric cameras, and a
user-worn Meta Quest 3 headset, which contributes two egocentric views. We
design an ego-exo tracking pipeline to generate accurate 3D hand pose ground
truth from this system, and rigorously evaluate its quality. By collecting an
annotated dataset featuring synchronized multi-view images and precise 3D hand
poses, we demonstrate the capability of our approach to significantly reduce
the trade-off between environmental realism and 3D annotation accuracy.

### [8] [Input-Aware Sparse Attention for Real-Time Co-Speech Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02617)
*Beijia Lu,Ziyi Chen,Jing Xiao,Jun-Yan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Distilling many-step diffusion models into few-step models for real-time co-speech video generation using input-aware sparse attention and distillation loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based co-speech video generation methods are too slow for real-time deployment due to numerous denoising steps and costly attention mechanisms.

Method: Proposes video distillation with input human pose conditioning for attention and loss functions, using accurate pose keypoint correspondence to guide sparse attention and input-aware distillation loss for improved lip sync and hand motion.

Result: Achieves real-time performance with improved visual quality compared to recent audio-driven and input-driven methods.

Conclusion: The integration of input-aware sparse attention and distillation loss enables efficient real-time co-speech video generation while maintaining high visual quality.

Abstract: Diffusion models can synthesize realistic co-speech video from audio for
various applications, such as video creation and virtual agents. However,
existing diffusion-based methods are slow due to numerous denoising steps and
costly attention mechanisms, preventing real-time deployment. In this work, we
distill a many-step diffusion video model into a few-step student model.
Unfortunately, directly applying recent diffusion distillation methods degrades
video quality and falls short of real-time performance. To address these
issues, our new video distillation method leverages input human pose
conditioning for both attention and loss functions. We first propose using
accurate correspondence between input human pose keypoints to guide attention
to relevant regions, such as the speaker's face, hands, and upper body. This
input-aware sparse attention reduces redundant computations and strengthens
temporal correspondences of body parts, improving inference efficiency and
motion coherence. To further enhance visual quality, we introduce an
input-aware distillation loss that improves lip synchronization and hand motion
realism. By integrating our input-aware sparse attention and distillation loss,
our method achieves real-time performance with improved visual quality compared
to recent audio-driven and input-driven methods. We also conduct extensive
experiments showing the effectiveness of our algorithmic design choices.

### [9] [Deep Generative Continual Learning using Functional LoRA: FunLoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02631)
*Victor Enescu,Hichem Sahbi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FunLoRA is a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that uses functional low-rank adaptation with rank 1 matrices to enable continual learning in generative models without catastrophic forgetting, requiring training only on current task data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address catastrophic forgetting in continual learning of generative models, which typically requires retraining on synthetic data leading to intractable training times and performance degradation due to synthetic data limitations.

Method: Designs a dynamic conditioning mechanism using functional LoRA (FunLoRA) with rank 1 matrices whose effective rank is increased through carefully selected functions, enabling parameter-efficient fine-tuning without retraining on previous data.

Result: FunLoRA surpasses prior state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods, achieving higher classification accuracy while requiring only a fraction of memory cost and sampling time in flow-matching models.

Conclusion: FunLoRA provides an effective solution for continual adaptation of generative models by eliminating catastrophic forgetting through expressive conditioning, enabling efficient training on current task data only.

Abstract: Continual adaptation of deep generative models holds tremendous potential and
critical importance, given their rapid and expanding usage in text and vision
based applications. Incremental training, however, remains highly challenging
due to catastrophic forgetting phenomenon, which makes it difficult for neural
networks to effectively incorporate new knowledge. A common strategy consists
in retraining the generative model on its own synthetic data in order to
mitigate forgetting. Yet, such an approach faces two major limitations: (i) the
continually increasing training time eventually becomes intractable, and (ii)
reliance on synthetic data inevitably leads to long-term performance
degradation, since synthetic samples lack the richness of real training data.
In this paper, we attenuate these issues by designing a novel and more
expressive conditioning mechanism for generative models based on low rank
adaptation (LoRA), that exclusively employs rank 1 matrices, whose
reparametrized matrix rank is functionally increased using carefully selected
functions -- and dubbed functional LoRA: FunLoRA. Using this dynamic
conditioning, the generative model is guaranteed to avoid catastrophic
forgetting and needs only to be trained on data from the current task.
Extensive experiments using flow-matching based models trained from scratch,
showcase that our proposed parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method
surpasses prior state-of-the-art results based on diffusion models, reaching
higher classification accuracy scores, while only requiring a fraction of the
memory cost and sampling time.

### [10] [Sequence-Preserving Dual-FoV Defense for Traffic Sign and Light Recognition in Autonomous Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02642)
*Abhishek Joshi,Jahnavi Krishna Koda,Abhishek Phadke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a dual field-of-view, sequence-preserving robustness framework for traffic light and sign recognition in autonomous vehicles, using a multi-source dataset and unified defense stack to improve accuracy and reduce attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traffic light and sign recognition is critical for autonomous vehicle safety, but current models are vulnerable to both digital adversarial attacks and natural perturbations (glare, rain, dirt, graffiti), lacking consideration of temporal continuity and multi-static field-of-view sensing.

Method: Developed a dual FoV framework using multi-source dataset (aiMotive, Udacity, Waymo, self-recorded Texas videos) with temporal alignment for four operational domains. Implemented unified three-layer defense stack with feature squeezing, defensive distillation, entropy-based anomaly detection, and sequence-wise temporal voting.

Result: The Unified Defense Stack achieved 79.8 mAP and reduced attack success rate to 18.2%, outperforming YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and BEVFormer while reducing high-risk misclassification to 32%. Physical transferability was confirmed through recapture probes.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses robustness gaps in traffic perception by incorporating temporal continuity and multi-view sensing, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy and security against both digital and natural perturbations.

Abstract: Traffic light and sign recognition are key for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs)
because perception mistakes directly influence navigation and safety. In
addition to digital adversarial attacks, models are vulnerable to existing
perturbations (glare, rain, dirt, or graffiti), which could lead to dangerous
misclassifications. The current work lacks consideration of temporal
continuity, multistatic field-of-view (FoV) sensing, and robustness to both
digital and natural degradation. This study proposes a dual FoV,
sequence-preserving robustness framework for traffic lights and signs in the
USA based on a multi-source dataset built on aiMotive, Udacity, Waymo, and
self-recorded videos from the region of Texas. Mid and long-term sequences of
RGB images are temporally aligned for four operational design domains (ODDs):
highway, night, rainy, and urban. Over a series of experiments on a real-life
application of anomaly detection, this study outlines a unified three-layer
defense stack framework that incorporates feature squeezing, defensive
distillation, and entropy-based anomaly detection, as well as sequence-wise
temporal voting for further enhancement. The evaluation measures included
accuracy, attack success rate (ASR), risk-weighted misclassification severity,
and confidence stability. Physical transferability was confirmed using probes
for recapture. The results showed that the Unified Defense Stack achieved
79.8mAP and reduced the ASR to 18.2%, which is superior to YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and
BEVFormer, while reducing the high-risk misclassification to 32%.

*Benjamin Yu,Jackie Liu,Justin Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Smart-GRPO is the first method to optimize noise perturbations for reinforcement learning in flow-matching models, using iterative search to refine noise distributions toward higher-reward regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow-matching models are deterministic and poorly suited for reinforcement learning, which is crucial for improving image quality and human alignment. Existing noise perturbation methods are inefficient and unstable.

Method: Smart-GRPO employs an iterative search strategy that decodes candidate perturbations, evaluates them with a reward function, and refines the noise distribution toward higher-reward regions.

Result: Experiments show Smart-GRPO improves both reward optimization and visual quality compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Smart-GRPO provides a practical path toward reinforcement learning in flow-matching frameworks, bridging the gap between efficient training and human-aligned generation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in flow-matching have enabled high-quality text-to-image
generation. However, the deterministic nature of flow-matching models makes
them poorly suited for reinforcement learning, a key tool for improving image
quality and human alignment. Prior work has introduced stochasticity by
perturbing latents with random noise, but such perturbations are inefficient
and unstable. We propose Smart-GRPO, the first method to optimize noise
perturbations for reinforcement learning in flow-matching models. Smart-GRPO
employs an iterative search strategy that decodes candidate perturbations,
evaluates them with a reward function, and refines the noise distribution
toward higher-reward regions. Experiments demonstrate that Smart-GRPO improves
both reward optimization and visual quality compared to baseline methods. Our
results suggest a practical path toward reinforcement learning in flow-matching
frameworks, bridging the gap between efficient training and human-aligned
generation.

*Yibin Zhao,Yihan Pan,Jun Nan,Jianjun Yi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSFSplatter enables fast surface reconstruction from free sparse images using dense Gaussian initialization, camera parameter estimation, and geometry-enhanced optimization, outperforming SOTA methods on DTU and Replica datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Gaussian Splatting methods require dense, calibrated views and struggle with sparse images due to limited overlap and overfitting, leading to poor surface reconstruction.

Method: Integrates end-to-end dense Gaussian initialization via large Transformer encoding, self-splitting Gaussian head, contribution-based pruning to remove floaters, and depth/multi-view feature supervision with differentiable camera parameters during optimization.

Result: Outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on widely used DTU and Replica datasets.

Conclusion: FSFSplatter provides an effective solution for high-quality surface reconstruction from free sparse images through integrated Gaussian initialization and geometry-enhanced optimization.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has become a leading reconstruction technique, known for
its high-quality novel view synthesis and detailed reconstruction. However,
most existing methods require dense, calibrated views. Reconstructing from free
sparse images often leads to poor surface due to limited overlap and
overfitting. We introduce FSFSplatter, a new approach for fast surface
reconstruction from free sparse images. Our method integrates end-to-end dense
Gaussian initialization, camera parameter estimation, and geometry-enhanced
scene optimization. Specifically, FSFSplatter employs a large Transformer to
encode multi-view images and generates a dense and geometrically consistent
Gaussian scene initialization via a self-splitting Gaussian head. It eliminates
local floaters through contribution-based pruning and mitigates overfitting to
limited views by leveraging depth and multi-view feature supervision with
differentiable camera parameters during rapid optimization. FSFSplatter
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on widely used DTU and Replica.

### [13] [MoGIC: Boosting Motion Generation via Intention Understanding and Visual Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02722)
*Junyu Shi,Yong Sun,Zhiyuan Zhang,Lijiang Liu,Zhengjie Zhang,Yuxin He,Qiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoGIC is a unified framework that integrates intention modeling and visual priors into multimodal motion synthesis, addressing limitations in existing text-driven motion generation methods by capturing causal logic and human intentions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-driven motion generation methods are limited in capturing causal logic of action execution and human intentions, and lack visual grounding which restricts precision and personalization.

Method: Jointly optimizes multimodal-conditioned motion generation and intention prediction, uses mixture-of-attention mechanism with adaptive scope for local alignment, and leverages visual priors. Introduces Mo440H benchmark with 440 hours of motion data.

Result: Reduces FID by 38.6% on HumanML3D and 34.6% on Mo440H, surpasses LLM-based methods in motion captioning, enables intention prediction and vision-conditioned generation.

Conclusion: MoGIC advances controllable motion synthesis and intention understanding by integrating intention modeling and visual priors into a unified multimodal framework.

Abstract: Existing text-driven motion generation methods often treat synthesis as a
bidirectional mapping between language and motion, but remain limited in
capturing the causal logic of action execution and the human intentions that
drive behavior. The absence of visual grounding further restricts precision and
personalization, as language alone cannot specify fine-grained spatiotemporal
details. We propose MoGIC, a unified framework that integrates intention
modeling and visual priors into multimodal motion synthesis. By jointly
optimizing multimodal-conditioned motion generation and intention prediction,
MoGIC uncovers latent human goals, leverages visual priors to enhance
generation, and exhibits versatile multimodal generative capability. We further
introduce a mixture-of-attention mechanism with adaptive scope to enable
effective local alignment between conditional tokens and motion subsequences.
To support this paradigm, we curate Mo440H, a 440-hour benchmark from 21
high-quality motion datasets. Experiments show that after finetuning, MoGIC
reduces FID by 38.6\% on HumanML3D and 34.6\% on Mo440H, surpasses LLM-based
methods in motion captioning with a lightweight text head, and further enables
intention prediction and vision-conditioned generation, advancing controllable
motion synthesis and intention understanding. The code is available at

### [14] [From Tokens to Nodes: Semantic-Guided Motion Control for Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02732)
*Jianing Chen,Zehao Li,Yujun Cai,Hao Jiang,Shuqin Gao,Honglong Zhao,Tianlu Mao,Yucheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A motion-adaptive framework for dynamic 3D reconstruction that aligns control point density with motion complexity using semantic and motion priors, replacing MLP-based deformation with spline trajectories for smoother motion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic 3D reconstruction from monocular videos faces challenges due to 3D motion ambiguity and computational demands. Existing sparse control methods suffer from static redundancy and dynamic insufficiency because they allocate points purely by geometry rather than motion complexity.

Method: Uses semantic and motion priors from vision foundation models to establish patch-token-node correspondences, applies motion-adaptive compression to concentrate control points in dynamic regions, and employs iterative voxelization with motion tendency scoring. Replaces MLP-based deformation fields with spline-based trajectory parameterization initialized by 2D tracklets.

Result: Achieves significant improvements in reconstruction quality and efficiency over state-of-the-art methods, with smoother motion representation and more stable optimization.

Conclusion: The proposed motion-adaptive framework successfully addresses the fundamental mismatch between control point allocation and motion complexity, enabling more efficient and higher-quality dynamic 3D reconstruction from monocular videos.

Abstract: Dynamic 3D reconstruction from monocular videos remains difficult due to the
ambiguity inferring 3D motion from limited views and computational demands of
modeling temporally varying scenes. While recent sparse control methods
alleviate computation by reducing millions of Gaussians to thousands of control
points, they suffer from a critical limitation: they allocate points purely by
geometry, leading to static redundancy and dynamic insufficiency. We propose a
motion-adaptive framework that aligns control density with motion complexity.
Leveraging semantic and motion priors from vision foundation models, we
establish patch-token-node correspondences and apply motion-adaptive
compression to concentrate control points in dynamic regions while suppressing
redundancy in static backgrounds. Our approach achieves flexible
representational density adaptation through iterative voxelization and motion
tendency scoring, directly addressing the fundamental mismatch between control
point allocation and motion complexity. To capture temporal evolution, we
introduce spline-based trajectory parameterization initialized by 2D tracklets,
replacing MLP-based deformation fields to achieve smoother motion
representation and more stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in reconstruction quality and efficiency over existing
state-of-the-art methods.

*Weimin Yuan,Cai Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Net2Net combines untrained DIP and pre-trained DRUNet networks using RED regularization for real-world noise removal, achieving better generalization without requiring extensive labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional denoising methods rely on handcrafted priors and struggle with real noise complexity, while deep learning methods need extensive labeled data and may not generalize well across diverse noise types.

Method: Hybrid framework combining unsupervised Deep Image Prior (DIP) with supervised pre-trained DRUNet model using Regularization by Denoising (RED), allowing adaptation to unique noise characteristics without labeled data while leveraging learned representations.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance for real-world noise removal, particularly in scenarios with limited training data.

Conclusion: Net2Net effectively addresses real-world noise removal challenges by combining the strengths of untrained and pre-trained networks, enhancing generalization across varying noise patterns and improving performance with limited data.

Abstract: Traditional denoising methods for noise removal have largely relied on
handcrafted priors, often perform well in controlled environments but struggle
to address the complexity and variability of real noise. In contrast, deep
learning-based approaches have gained prominence for learning noise
characteristics from large datasets, but these methods frequently require
extensive labeled data and may not generalize effectively across diverse noise
types and imaging conditions. In this paper, we present an innovative method,
termed as Net2Net, that combines the strengths of untrained and pre-trained
networks to tackle the challenges of real-world noise removal. The innovation
of Net2Net lies in its combination of unsupervised DIP and supervised
pre-trained model DRUNet by regularization by denoising (RED). The untrained
network adapts to the unique noise characteristics of each input image without
requiring labeled data, while the pre-trained network leverages learned
representations from large-scale datasets to deliver robust denoising
performance. This hybrid framework enhances generalization across varying noise
patterns and improves performance, particularly in scenarios with limited
training data. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our method for real-world noise removal.

*Lanyun Zhu,Deyi Ji,Tianrun Chen,Haiyang Wu,Shiqi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Retrv-R1 is the first R1-style multimodal LLM designed for universal retrieval, using step-by-step reasoning to improve accuracy. It addresses computational cost and training instability issues through information compression and a new training paradigm with curriculum RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Directly applying DeepSeek-R1 methods to retrieval tasks is infeasible due to high computational costs from large token consumption and instability when using RL for retrieval training.

Method: Introduces information compression with details inspection to reduce tokens while preserving critical information, and a new training paradigm with retrieval-tailored synthetic CoT dataset activation followed by curriculum RL.

Result: Retrv-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance, high efficiency, and strong generalization across multiple benchmarks and tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully adapts R1-style reasoning to multimodal retrieval tasks, overcoming computational and training challenges to deliver superior performance.

Abstract: The success of DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates the immense potential of using
reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities. This paper
introduces Retrv-R1, the first R1-style MLLM specifically designed for
multimodal universal retrieval, achieving higher performance by employing
step-by-step reasoning to produce more accurate retrieval results. We find that
directly applying the methods of DeepSeek-R1 to retrieval tasks is not
feasible, mainly due to (1) the high computational cost caused by the large
token consumption required for multiple candidates with reasoning processes,
and (2) the instability and suboptimal results when directly applying RL to
train for retrieval tasks. To address these issues, Retrv-R1 introduces an
information compression module with a details inspection mechanism, which
enhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of tokens while
ensuring that critical information for challenging candidates is preserved.
Furthermore, a new training paradigm is proposed, including an activation stage
using a retrieval-tailored synthetic CoT dataset for more effective
optimization, followed by RL with a novel curriculum reward to improve both
performance and efficiency. Incorporating these novel designs, Retrv-R1
achieves SOTA performance, high efficiency, and strong generalization ability,
as demonstrated by experiments across multiple benchmarks and tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BCA+ is a training-free test-time adaptation framework for vision-language models that uses Bayesian inference with dynamic caching of class embeddings, spatial scales, and adaptive priors to improve object recognition and detection under distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time adaptation methods either rely on computationally expensive backpropagation or focus only on likelihood adaptation while ignoring the important role of class priors, limiting real-time deployment and performance.

Method: BCA+ introduces a dynamic cache that stores and updates class embeddings, spatial scales for detection, and adaptive class priors from historical predictions. It formulates adaptation as Bayesian inference, fusing initial VLM outputs with cache-based predictions that combine dynamically updated likelihoods and evolving class priors.

Result: Extensive experiments show BCA+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both recognition and detection benchmarks while being highly efficient as a training-free method requiring no backpropagation.

Conclusion: BCA+ provides a unified, training-free framework that enables efficient test-time adaptation for both object recognition and detection through Bayesian inference with dual-adaptation mechanisms, correcting both semantic understanding and contextual confidence.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP and Grounding DINO have achieved
remarkable success in object recognition and detection. However, their
performance often degrades under real-world distribution shifts. Test-time
adaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate this issue by adapting models during
inference. Existing methods either rely on computationally expensive
backpropagation, which hinders real-time deployment, or focus solely on
likelihood adaptation, which overlooks the critical role of the prior. Our
prior work, Bayesian Class Adaptation (BCA), addressed these shortcomings for
object recognition by introducing a training-free framework that incorporates
adaptive priors. Building upon this foundation, we now present Bayesian Class
Adaptation plus (BCA+), a unified, training-free framework for TTA for both
object recognition and detection. BCA+ introduces a dynamic cache that
adaptively stores and updates class embeddings, spatial scales (for detection),
and, crucially, adaptive class priors derived from historical predictions. We
formulate adaptation as a Bayesian inference problem, where final predictions
are generated by fusing the initial VLM output with a cache-based prediction.
This cache-based prediction combines a dynamically updated likelihood
(measuring feature and scale similarity) and a prior (reflecting the evolving
class distribution). This dual-adaptation mechanism, coupled with
uncertainty-guided fusion, enables BCA+ to correct both the model's semantic
understanding and its contextual confidence. As a training-free method
requiring no backpropagation, BCA+ is highly efficient. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BCA+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both recognition
and detection benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HGCD-BT is a hierarchical generalized category discovery method for brain tumor classification that identifies both known and unknown tumor types using hierarchical clustering with contrastive learning, achieving significant improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing brain tumor classification methods are limited to predefined classes and cannot identify novel tumor types not seen during training, which is critical for intra-operative decision making in neuro-oncological surgery.

Method: Integrates hierarchical clustering with contrastive learning, extending contrastive learning based GCD with a novel semi-supervised hierarchical clustering loss to capture the hierarchical structure of brain tumor taxonomies.

Result: Achieved +28% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art GCD methods for patch-level classification on OpenSRH dataset, particularly in identifying previously unseen tumor categories. Also demonstrated generalizability on slide-level classification with hematoxylin and eosin stained whole-slide images.

Conclusion: HGCD-BT effectively bridges the gap between supervised and unsupervised learning for brain tumor classification, enabling identification of both known and unknown tumor types while capturing hierarchical relationships, with demonstrated utility across different imaging modalities.

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor classification is critical for intra-operative decision
making in neuro-oncological surgery. However, existing approaches are
restricted to a fixed set of predefined classes and are therefore unable to
capture patterns of tumor types not available during training. Unsupervised
learning can extract general-purpose features, but it lacks the ability to
incorporate prior knowledge from labelled data, and semi-supervised methods
often assume that all potential classes are represented in the labelled data.
Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to bridge this gap by categorizing
both known and unknown classes within unlabelled data. To reflect the
hierarchical structure of brain tumor taxonomies, in this work, we introduce
Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification
(HGCD-BT), a novel approach that integrates hierarchical clustering with
contrastive learning. Our method extends contrastive learning based GCD by
incorporating a novel semi-supervised hierarchical clustering loss. We evaluate
HGCD-BT on OpenSRH, a dataset of stimulated Raman histology brain tumor images,
achieving a +28% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art GCD methods for
patch-level classification, particularly in identifying previously unseen tumor
categories. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of HGCD-BT on
slide-level classification of hematoxylin and eosin stained whole-slide images
from the Digital Brain Tumor Atlas, confirming its utility across imaging
modalities.

*Xian Zhang,Zexi Wu,Zinuo Li,Hongming Xu,Luqi Gong,Farid Boussaid,Naoufel Werghi,Mohammed Bennamoun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaRD-Key is a training-free keyframe sampling module for long-form video understanding that maximizes a unified Relevance-Diversity objective, automatically switching between relevance-driven and diversity-only modes based on query-video alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with long-form videos due to uniform sampling missing critical moments, while existing keyframe selection methods either impose rigid temporal spacing that misses fine-grained cues or emphasize diversity but neglect query relevance.

Method: Proposes AdaRD-Key that maximizes a unified Relevance-Diversity Max-Volume objective combining query-conditioned relevance with log-determinant diversity. Uses lightweight relevance-aware gating to automatically switch between relevance-driven and diversity-only modes based on query-video alignment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on LongVideoBench and Video-MME benchmarks, particularly on long-form videos. Runs in real time on a single GPU and is compatible with existing VLMs in plug-and-play manner.

Conclusion: AdaRD-Key effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by balancing relevance and diversity, with automatic mode switching for optimal performance across different query-video alignment scenarios.

Abstract: Understanding long-form videos remains a significant challenge for
vision--language models (VLMs) due to their extensive temporal length and high
information density. Most current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely
on uniform sampling, which often overlooks critical moments, leading to
incorrect responses to queries. In parallel, many keyframe selection approaches
impose rigid temporal spacing: once a frame is chosen, an exclusion window
suppresses adjacent timestamps to reduce redundancy. While effective at
limiting overlap, this strategy frequently misses short, fine-grained cues near
important events. Other methods instead emphasize visual diversity but neglect
query relevance. We propose AdaRD-Key, a training-free keyframe sampling module
for query-driven long-form video understanding. AdaRD-Key maximizes a unified
Relevance--Diversity Max-Volume (RD-MV) objective, combining a
query-conditioned relevance score with a log-determinant diversity component to
yield informative yet non-redundant frames. To handle broad queries with weak
alignment to the video, AdaRD-Key employs a lightweight relevance-aware gating
mechanism; when the relevance distribution indicates weak alignment, the method
seamlessly shifts into a diversity-only mode, enhancing coverage without
additional supervision. Our pipeline is training-free, computationally
efficient (running in real time on a single GPU), and compatible with existing
VLMs in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments on LongVideoBench and
Video-MME demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, particularly on long-form
videos. Code available at https://github.com/Xian867/AdaRD-Key.

*Prahitha Movva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) approach complex lateral thinking challenges like rebus puzzles, focusing on their reasoning processes and failure patterns rather than just performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While VLMs struggle with rebus puzzles, their underlying cognitive processes and failure patterns remain largely unexplored. The authors aim to understand how VLMs approach these complex lateral thinking challenges beyond simple performance metrics.

Method: Created a systematically annotated dataset of 221 rebus puzzles across six cognitive categories, developed an evaluation framework separating reasoning quality from answer correctness, and investigated three prompting strategies to elicit different explanatory processes.

Result: Reasoning quality varies dramatically across puzzle categories - models show systematic strengths in visual composition but fundamental limitations in absence interpretation and cultural symbolism. Prompting strategy substantially influences both cognitive approach and problem-solving effectiveness.

Conclusion: Explainability should be an integral component of model performance evaluation rather than a post-hoc consideration, as it reveals critical insights into VLM cognitive processes and their systematic strengths and limitations.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet their
cognitive processes remain opaque on complex lateral thinking challenges like
rebus puzzles. While recent work has demonstrated these models struggle
significantly with rebus puzzle solving, the underlying reasoning processes and
failure patterns remain largely unexplored. We address this gap through a
comprehensive explainability analysis that moves beyond performance metrics to
understand how VLMs approach these complex lateral thinking challenges. Our
study contributes a systematically annotated dataset of 221 rebus puzzles
across six cognitive categories, paired with an evaluation framework that
separates reasoning quality from answer correctness. We investigate three
prompting strategies designed to elicit different types of explanatory
processes and reveal critical insights into VLM cognitive processes. Our
findings demonstrate that reasoning quality varies dramatically across puzzle
categories, with models showing systematic strengths in visual composition
while exhibiting fundamental limitations in absence interpretation and cultural
symbolism. We also discover that prompting strategy substantially influences
both cognitive approach and problem-solving effectiveness, establishing
explainability as an integral component of model performance rather than a
post-hoc consideration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new synthetic dataset for text removal that addresses limitations in existing benchmarks by using complex backgrounds and vision-language models to create more challenging and realistic scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text removal datasets have limitations including ground truth artifacts from manual editing, overly simplistic backgrounds, and inadequate evaluation metrics that don't properly assess result quality.

Method: The authors developed an approach to synthesize text removal benchmarks using object-aware text placement on complex backgrounds and vision-language model-generated content to ensure clean ground truth.

Result: The paper presents a new dataset featuring text rendered on complex backgrounds with clean ground truth, designed to be applicable to domains beyond scene text removal.

Conclusion: The introduced dataset addresses key limitations in existing text removal benchmarks and is publicly available for use in text removal research.

Abstract: Text removal is a crucial task in computer vision with applications such as
privacy preservation, image editing, and media reuse. While existing research
has primarily focused on scene text removal in natural images, limitations in
current datasets hinder out-of-domain generalization or accurate evaluation. In
particular, widely used benchmarks such as SCUT-EnsText suffer from ground
truth artifacts due to manual editing, overly simplistic text backgrounds, and
evaluation metrics that do not capture the quality of generated results. To
address these issues, we introduce an approach to synthesizing a text removal
benchmark applicable to domains other than scene texts. Our dataset features
text rendered on complex backgrounds using object-aware placement and
vision-language model-generated content, ensuring clean ground truth and
challenging text removal scenarios. The dataset is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for multimodal medical object detection that aligns DETR-style object queries with modality context using modality tokens and contrastive pretraining, improving detection performance across diverse medical imaging modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical object detection struggles when trained on mixed modalities (CXR, CT, MRI) due to heterogeneous statistics and disjoint representation spaces, requiring representation alignment for effective multimodal learning.

Method: Uses modality tokens (text-derived embeddings) with Multimodality Context Attention (MoCA) to propagate modality context within object queries, plus QueryREPA pretraining with contrastive objective to align queries with modality tokens.

Result: Consistently improves Average Precision (AP) across diverse medical modalities with minimal overhead and no architectural modifications to DETR-style detectors.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical path toward robust multimodality medical object detection by producing modality-aware, class-faithful queries that transfer effectively to downstream training.

Abstract: Medical object detection suffers when a single detector is trained on mixed
medical modalities (e.g., CXR, CT, MRI) due to heterogeneous statistics and
disjoint representation spaces. To address this challenge, we turn to
representation alignment, an approach that has proven effective for bringing
features from different sources into a shared space. Specifically, we target
the representations of DETR-style object queries and propose a simple,
detector-agnostic framework to align them with modality context. First, we
define modality tokens: compact, text-derived embeddings encoding imaging
modality that are lightweight and require no extra annotations. We integrate
the modality tokens into the detection process via Multimodality Context
Attention (MoCA), mixing object-query representations via self-attention to
propagate modality context within the query set. This preserves DETR-style
architectures and adds negligible latency while injecting modality cues into
object queries. We further introduce QueryREPA, a short pretraining stage that
aligns query representations to their modality tokens using a task-specific
contrastive objective with modality-balanced batches. Together, MoCA and
QueryREPA produce modality-aware, class-faithful queries that transfer
effectively to downstream training. Across diverse modalities trained
altogether, the proposed approach consistently improves AP with minimal
overhead and no architectural modifications, offering a practical path toward
robust multimodality medical object detection. Project page:

TL;DR: MaskCD is a method that uses "image heads" in large vision-language models to create contrastive samples by masking them, which helps reduce hallucinations while maintaining general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for addressing hallucinations in LVLMs have limitations - contrastive decoding struggles with constructing appropriate contrastive samples, and attention manipulation methods lack stability and are highly sensitive.

Method: Proposed image head Masked Contrastive Decoding (MaskCD) that utilizes the "image heads" in LVLMs by masking them to construct contrastive samples for contrastive decoding.

Result: Evaluated on LLaVA-1.5-7b and Qwen-VL-7b using benchmarks like CHAIR, POPE, AMBER and MME, showing that MaskCD effectively alleviates hallucinations while retaining general capabilities of LVLMs.

Conclusion: MaskCD provides an effective approach to reduce hallucinations in large vision-language models by leveraging image head masking for contrastive decoding, addressing limitations of previous methods.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
visual-language understanding for downstream multimodal tasks. While their
capabilities are improving, problems emerge simultaneously. Among those
problems, the hallucinations have attracted much attention, which stands for
the phenomenon where LVLMs generate contradictory content to their input visual
and text contents. Many approaches have been proposed to deal with this issue,
such as contrastive decoding and attention manipulation. However, contrastive
decoding methods struggle in constructing appropriate contrastive samples, and
attention manipulation methods are highly sensitive, lacking stability. In this
work, we propose image head Masked Contrastive Decoding (MaskCD). Our approach
utilizes the "image heads" in LVLMs, masking them to construct contrastive
samples for contrastive decoding. We evaluated MaskCD on LLaVA-1.5-7b and
Qwen-VL-7b, using various benchmarks such as CHAIR, POPE, AMBER and MME. The
results demonstrate that MaskCD effectively alleviates the phenomenon of
hallucinations and retains the general capabilities of LVLMs. Corresponding

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MEACI-Net is a two-stream framework for compressed video action recognition that enhances motion representations and improves RGB-motion modality fusion through selective motion complement and cross-modality augmentation modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compressed video action recognition suffers from coarse/noisy motion dynamics and insufficient fusion between RGB and motion modalities, which limits performance despite reduced computational costs.

Method: Two-stream architecture with motion stream using multi-scale blocks and denoising modules, plus SMC for attentive local motion feature complement and CMA for selective feature augmentation between modalities.

Result: Extensive experiments on UCF-101, HMDB-51 and Kinetics-400 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of MEACI-Net.

Conclusion: The proposed MEACI-Net successfully addresses motion enhancement and cross-modal interaction challenges in compressed video action recognition, achieving strong performance on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Compressed video action recognition has recently drawn growing attention,
since it remarkably reduces the storage and computational cost via replacing
raw videos by sparsely sampled RGB frames and compressed motion cues (e.g.,
motion vectors and residuals). However, this task severely suffers from the
coarse and noisy dynamics and the insufficient fusion of the heterogeneous RGB
and motion modalities. To address the two issues above, this paper proposes a
novel framework, namely Attentive Cross-modal Interaction Network with Motion
Enhancement (MEACI-Net). It follows the two-stream architecture, i.e. one for
the RGB modality and the other for the motion modality. Particularly, the
motion stream employs a multi-scale block embedded with a denoising module to
enhance representation learning. The interaction between the two streams is
then strengthened by introducing the Selective Motion Complement (SMC) and
Cross-Modality Augment (CMA) modules, where SMC complements the RGB modality
with spatio-temporally attentive local motion features and CMA further combines
the two modalities with selective feature augmentation. Extensive experiments
on the UCF-101, HMDB-51 and Kinetics-400 benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of MEACI-Net.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pose estimation at small scales remains challenging, with few solutions capable of capturing 6 degrees of freedom with nanometric and microradian resolutions over large ranges for microscopy applications.

Method: The software uses phase-based local thresholding algorithm and phase processing of pseudo-periodic patterns, with different pattern designs addressing various application needs.

Conclusion: Guidelines are provided for selecting appropriate pattern designs and microscope magnification lenses based on desired performance, with implementation illustrated using synthetic and experimental images.

Abstract: Pose estimation is still a challenge at the small scales. Few solutions exist
to capture the 6 degrees of freedom of an object with nanometric and
microradians resolutions over relatively large ranges. Over the years, we have
proposed several fiducial marker and pattern designs to achieve reliable
performance for various microscopy applications. Centimeter ranges are possible
using pattern encoding methods, while nanometer resolutions can be achieved
using phase processing of the periodic frames. This paper presents VERNIER, an
open source phase processing software designed to provide fast and reliable
pose measurement based on pseudo-periodic patterns. Thanks to a phase-based
local thresholding algorithm, the software has proven to be particularly robust
to noise, defocus and occlusion. The successive steps of the phase processing
are presented, as well as the different types of patterns that address
different application needs. The implementation procedure is illustrated with

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Med-K2N proposes a novel framework for K to N medical image synthesis that addresses three key challenges: modeling heterogeneous modality contributions, ensuring fusion quality control, and maintaining modality identity consistency through adaptive weighting and causal constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical necessity for flexible modality reconstruction in medical imaging, where multiple input modalities need to be synthesized into multiple target modalities while addressing challenges of heterogeneous contributions, fusion quality control, and modality identity consistency.

Method: Treats multi-modal medical data as sequential frames with quality-driven selection, featuring three collaborative modules: PreWeightNet (global contribution assessment), ThresholdNet (adaptive filtering), and EffiWeightNet (effective weight computation), plus Causal Modality Identity Module (CMIM) for maintaining modality consistency using vision-language modeling.

Result: Extensive experiments show Med-K2N outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance in cross-modal medical image synthesis.

Conclusion: The proposed Med-K2N framework effectively addresses key challenges in K to N medical generation through adaptive weighting mechanisms and causal modality identity constraints, providing a robust solution for clinical modality reconstruction needs.

Abstract: Cross-modal medical image synthesis research focuses on reconstructing
missing imaging modalities from available ones to support clinical diagnosis.
Driven by clinical necessities for flexible modality reconstruction, we explore
K to N medical generation, where three critical challenges emerge: How can we
model the heterogeneous contributions of different modalities to various target
tasks? How can we ensure fusion quality control to prevent degradation from
noisy information? How can we maintain modality identity consistency in
multi-output generation? Driven by these clinical necessities, and drawing
inspiration from SAM2's sequential frame paradigm and clinicians' progressive
workflow of incrementally adding and selectively integrating multi-modal
information, we treat multi-modal medical data as sequential frames with
quality-driven selection mechanisms. Our key idea is to "learn" adaptive
weights for each modality-task pair and "memorize" beneficial fusion patterns
through progressive enhancement. To achieve this, we design three collaborative
modules: PreWeightNet for global contribution assessment, ThresholdNet for
adaptive filtering, and EffiWeightNet for effective weight computation.
Meanwhile, to maintain modality identity consistency, we propose the Causal
Modality Identity Module (CMIM) that establishes causal constraints between
generated images and target modality descriptions using vision-language
modeling. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Med-K2N
outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins on multiple
benchmarks. Source code is available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ELMF4EggQ is an ensemble learning framework that uses multimodal feature fusion (image, shape, weight) to classify egg grade and freshness through non-invasive external measurements, achieving 86.57% accuracy for grade classification and 70.83% for freshness prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate, non-destructive assessment of egg quality is critical for food safety, product standards, and operational efficiency in commercial poultry production. Current methods often require invasive internal measurements.

Method: Uses ensemble learning with multimodal feature fusion combining deep features from external egg images (using ResNet152, DenseNet169, ResNet152V2) with structural characteristics (shape and weight). Includes PCA dimensionality reduction, SMOTE augmentation, and ensemble voting mechanism.

Result: Multimodal approach significantly outperforms image-only and tabular-only baselines, achieving 86.57% accuracy in grade classification and 70.83% in freshness prediction. Created first publicly available dataset of 186 brown-shelled eggs with expert-assessed internal quality labels.

Conclusion: The framework successfully demonstrates that internal egg quality can be assessed using only external, non-invasive features, providing a practical solution for commercial applications while promoting transparency through publicly available code and data.

Abstract: Accurate, non-destructive assessment of egg quality is critical for ensuring
food safety, maintaining product standards, and operational efficiency in
commercial poultry production. This paper introduces ELMF4EggQ, an ensemble
learning framework that employs multimodal feature fusion to classify egg grade
and freshness using only external attributes - image, shape, and weight. A
novel, publicly available dataset of 186 brown-shelled eggs was constructed,
with egg grade and freshness levels determined through laboratory-based expert
assessments involving internal quality measurements, such as yolk index and
Haugh unit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply
machine learning methods for internal egg quality assessment using only
external, non-invasive features, and the first to release a corresponding
labeled dataset. The proposed framework integrates deep features extracted from
external egg images with structural characteristics such as egg shape and
weight, enabling a comprehensive representation of each egg. Image feature
extraction is performed using top-performing pre-trained CNN models (ResNet152,
DenseNet169, and ResNet152V2), followed by PCA-based dimensionality reduction,
SMOTE augmentation, and classification using multiple machine learning
algorithms. An ensemble voting mechanism combines predictions from the
best-performing classifiers to enhance overall accuracy. Experimental results
demonstrate that the multimodal approach significantly outperforms image-only
and tabular (shape and weight) only baselines, with the multimodal ensemble
approach achieving 86.57% accuracy in grade classification and 70.83% in
freshness prediction. All code and data are publicly available at

TL;DR: Patch-ioner is a zero-shot captioning framework that shifts from image-centric to patch-centric paradigm, enabling captioning of arbitrary image regions without region-level supervision by treating patches as atomic captioning units.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current zero-shot captioners only use global image representations and can only generate whole-image captions, lacking the ability to describe arbitrary regions without paired training data.

Method: Treats individual image patches as atomic captioning units and aggregates them to describe arbitrary regions (single patches, non-contiguous areas, entire images) using meaningful dense visual features from backbones like DINO.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot dense, region-set, and trace captioning tasks, outperforming other baselines and competitors.

Conclusion: Patch-wise semantic representations are effective for scalable caption generation, with dense visual features being key to enabling zero-shot region-based captioning without supervision.

Abstract: Zero-shot captioners are recently proposed models that utilize common-space
vision-language representations to caption images without relying on paired
image-text data. To caption an image, they proceed by textually decoding a
text-aligned image feature, but they limit their scope to global
representations and whole-image captions. We present \frameworkName{}, a
unified framework for zero-shot captioning that shifts from an image-centric to
a patch-centric paradigm, enabling the captioning of arbitrary regions without
the need of region-level supervision. Instead of relying on global image
representations, we treat individual patches as atomic captioning units and
aggregate them to describe arbitrary regions, from single patches to
non-contiguous areas and entire images. We analyze the key ingredients that
enable current latent captioners to work in our novel proposed framework.
Experiments demonstrate that backbones producing meaningful, dense visual
features, such as DINO, are key to achieving state-of-the-art performance in
multiple region-based captioning tasks. Compared to other baselines and
state-of-the-art competitors, our models achieve better performance on
zero-shot dense, region-set, and a newly introduced trace captioning task,
highlighting the effectiveness of patch-wise semantic representations for
scalable caption generation. Project page at https://paciosoft.com/Patch-ioner/ .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a training-free approach using InternImage backbone features with K-Means clustering and confidence thresholding to detect out-of-distribution regions in semantic segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on RoadAnomaly and ADE-OoD benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether foundation models fine-tuned on segmentation datasets can inherently distinguish in-distribution from out-of-distribution regions without outlier supervision, which is crucial for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving.

Method: A simple training-free approach that utilizes features from InternImage backbone and applies K-Means clustering alongside confidence thresholding on raw decoder logits to identify OoD clusters.

Result: Achieves 50.02 Average Precision on RoadAnomaly benchmark and 48.77 on ADE-OoD benchmark with InternImage-L, surpassing several supervised and unsupervised baselines.

Conclusion: The results suggest a promising direction for generic OoD segmentation methods that require minimal assumptions or additional data, demonstrating that foundation models can effectively detect unknown objects without explicit outlier supervision.

Abstract: Detecting unknown objects in semantic segmentation is crucial for
safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Large vision
foundation models, including DINOv2, InternImage, and CLIP, have advanced
visual representation learning by providing rich features that generalize well
across diverse tasks. While their strength in closed-set semantic tasks is
established, their capability to detect out-of-distribution (OoD) regions in
semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate
whether foundation models fine-tuned on segmentation datasets can inherently
distinguish in-distribution (ID) from OoD regions without any outlier
supervision. We propose a simple, training-free approach that utilizes features
from the InternImage backbone and applies K-Means clustering alongside
confidence thresholding on raw decoder logits to identify OoD clusters. Our
method achieves 50.02 Average Precision on the RoadAnomaly benchmark and 48.77
on the benchmark of ADE-OoD with InternImage-L, surpassing several supervised
and unsupervised baselines. These results suggest a promising direction for
generic OoD segmentation methods that require minimal assumptions or additional
data.

*Xin Zou,Di Lu,Yizhou Wang,Yibo Yan,Yuanhuiyi Lyu,Xu Zheng,Linfeng Zhang,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HoloV is a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for MLLMs that uses holistic spatial budget distribution instead of attention-based pruning to maintain performance under high pruning ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs suffer from computational overhead due to massive visual tokens, and existing attention-based pruning methods preserve semantically similar tokens, causing performance drops under high pruning ratios.

Method: HoloV adaptively distributes pruning budget across different spatial crops to retain global visual context rather than isolated salient features, minimizing representational collapse.

Result: LLaVA1.5 with HoloV preserves 95.8% of original performance after pruning 88.9% of visual tokens, achieving superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs across various tasks and MLLM architectures.

Conclusion: HoloV provides an effective alternative to attention-first pruning by taking a holistic perspective, enabling aggressive token pruning while maintaining task-relevant information and performance.

Abstract: Despite their powerful capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
suffer from considerable computational overhead due to their reliance on
massive visual tokens. Recent studies have explored token pruning to alleviate
this problem, which typically uses text-vision cross-attention or
[\texttt{CLS}] attention to assess and discard redundant visual tokens. In this
work, we identify a critical limitation of such attention-first pruning
approaches, i.e., they tend to preserve semantically similar tokens, resulting
in pronounced performance drops under high pruning ratios. To this end, we
propose {HoloV}, a simple yet effective, plug-and-play visual token pruning
framework for efficient inference. Distinct from previous attention-first
schemes, HoloV rethinks token retention from a holistic perspective. By
adaptively distributing the pruning budget across different spatial crops,
HoloV ensures that the retained tokens capture the global visual context rather
than isolated salient features. This strategy minimizes representational
collapse and maintains task-relevant information even under aggressive pruning.
Experimental results demonstrate that our HoloV achieves superior performance
across various tasks, MLLM architectures, and pruning ratios compared to SOTA
methods. For instance, LLaVA1.5 equipped with HoloV preserves 95.8\% of the
original performance after pruning 88.9\% of visual tokens, achieving superior
efficiency-accuracy trade-offs.

*Nikoo Naghavian,Mostafa Tavassolipour*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAW enhances zero-shot robustness in vision-language models through confidence-aware loss and feature alignment regularization, improving both clean and robust accuracy without sacrificing generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models like CLIP show strong zero-shot generalization but are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, creating a need for improved robustness.

Method: CAW consists of two components: (1) Confidence-Aware loss that prioritizes uncertain adversarial examples by scaling KL divergence, and (2) feature alignment regularization that preserves semantic consistency between frozen and fine-tuned encoder features.

Result: Extensive experiments on TinyImageNet and 14 additional datasets show CAW outperforms recent methods like PMG-AFT and TGA-ZSR under strong attacks like AutoAttack, while using less memory.

Conclusion: CAW effectively enhances zero-shot robustness in vision-language models by jointly improving clean and robust accuracy through confidence-aware weighting and feature alignment.

Abstract: Vision-language models like CLIP demonstrate impressive zero-shot
generalization but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this
work, we propose Confidence-Aware Weighting (CAW) to enhance zero-shot
robustness in vision-language models. CAW consists of two components: (1) a
Confidence-Aware loss that prioritizes uncertain adversarial examples by
scaling the KL divergence between clean and adversarial predictions, and (2) a
feature alignment regularization that preserves semantic consistency by
minimizing the distance between frozen and fine-tuned image encoder features on
adversarial inputs. These components work jointly to improve both clean and
robust accuracy without sacrificing generalization. Extensive experiments on
TinyImageNet and 14 additional datasets show that CAW outperforms recent
methods such as PMG-AFT and TGA-ZSR under strong attacks like AutoAttack, while
using less memory.

*Daphne Tsolissou,Theofanis Ganitidis,Konstantinos Mitsis,Stergios CHristodoulidis,Maria Vakalopoulou,Konstantina Nikita*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LVLMs show promise but limitations in carotid plaque assessment; domain adaptation with LoRA improves stroke risk stratification; multimodal data integration enhances performance to match CNN baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable carotid disease risk assessment requires transparent integration of diverse clinical and imaging data, which current methods struggle to provide.

Method: Proposed interview-style framework using LVLMs to integrate ultrasound imaging with clinical/demographic/lab data; adapted LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna using LoRA for ultrasound domain; added multimodal tabular data as text.

Result: Zero-shot LVLMs poorly identify imaging modality/anatomy and risk classification; LoRA adaptation substantially improved stroke risk stratification; multimodal integration enhanced specificity and balanced accuracy to competitive CNN baseline levels.

Conclusion: LVLMs show promise for cardiovascular risk prediction but require multimodal integration, domain adaptation, and model calibration for clinical translation.

Abstract: Reliable risk assessment for carotid atheromatous disease remains a major
clinical challenge, as it requires integrating diverse clinical and imaging
information in a manner that is transparent and interpretable to clinicians.
This study investigates the potential of state-of-the-art and recent large
vision-language models (LVLMs) for multimodal carotid plaque assessment by
integrating ultrasound imaging (USI) with structured clinical, demographic,
laboratory, and protein biomarker data. A framework that simulates realistic
diagnostic scenarios through interview-style question sequences is proposed,
comparing a range of open-source LVLMs, including both general-purpose and
medically tuned models. Zero-shot experiments reveal that even if they are very
powerful, not all LVLMs can accurately identify imaging modality and anatomy,
while all of them perform poorly in accurate risk classification. To address
this limitation, LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna is adapted to the ultrasound domain using
low-rank adaptation (LoRA), resulting in substantial improvements in stroke
risk stratification. The integration of multimodal tabular data in the form of
text further enhances specificity and balanced accuracy, yielding competitive
performance compared to prior convolutional neural network (CNN) baselines
trained on the same dataset. Our findings highlight both the promise and
limitations of LVLMs in ultrasound-based cardiovascular risk prediction,
underscoring the importance of multimodal integration, model calibration, and
domain adaptation for clinical translation.

TL;DR: FDA-VAE is a lightweight variational autoencoder that separates shared and independent features in multi-phase contrast-enhanced MRI synthesis using symmetric latent distributions and Y-shaped bidirectional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-phase CE MRI synthesis use inefficient deep autoencoders with low parameter efficiency and lack interpretable training strategies for feature separation.

Method: Proposes FDA-VAE that encodes input and target images into two latent distributions symmetric to standard normal distribution, using Y-shaped bidirectional training to separate shared and independent features.

Result: Significantly reduces model parameters and inference time while improving synthesis quality compared to existing deep autoencoder-based methods.

Conclusion: FDA-VAE provides an efficient and interpretable solution for multi-phase CE MRI synthesis with better parameter efficiency and synthesis performance.

Abstract: Separating shared and independent features is crucial for multi-phase
contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI synthesis. However, existing methods use deep
autoencoder generators with low parameter efficiency and lack interpretable
training strategies. In this paper, we propose Flip Distribution Alignment
Variational Autoencoder (FDA-VAE), a lightweight feature-decoupled VAE model
for multi-phase CE MRI synthesis. Our method encodes input and target images
into two latent distributions that are symmetric concerning a standard normal
distribution, effectively separating shared and independent features. The
Y-shaped bidirectional training strategy further enhances the interpretability
of feature separation. Experimental results show that compared to existing deep
autoencoder-based end-to-end synthesis methods, FDA-VAE significantly reduces
model parameters and inference time while effectively improving synthesis
quality. The source code is publicly available at

*Juntong Wang,Huiyu Duan,Jiarui Wang,Ziheng Jia,Guangtao Zhai,Xiongkuo Min*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LPG-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating long-prompt text-to-image generation, and TIT, a novel zero-shot metric that measures alignment by comparing the original prompt with LMM-generated descriptions of the created images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with long and detailed prompts, showing inconsistent generation quality. Existing evaluation metrics also perform poorly on long-prompt scenarios.

Method: Created LPG-Bench with 200 long prompts (avg 250+ words) and generated 2,600 images from 13 models. Introduced TIT metric using text-to-image-to-text consistency with two instantiations: TIT-Score and TIT-Score-LLM.

Result: TIT-Score-LLM achieved 7.31% absolute improvement in pairwise accuracy over the strongest baseline, showing superior alignment with human judgment compared to existing metrics like CLIP-score and LMM-score.

Conclusion: LPG-Bench and TIT methods provide comprehensive tools to benchmark and advance text-to-image models, particularly for long-prompt scenarios.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large multimodal models (LMMs), recent
text-to-image (T2I) models can generate high-quality images and demonstrate
great alignment to short prompts. However, they still struggle to effectively
understand and follow long and detailed prompts, displaying inconsistent
generation. To address this challenge, we introduce LPG-Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating long-prompt-based text-to-image generation. LPG-Bench
features 200 meticulously crafted prompts with an average length of over 250
words, approaching the input capacity of several leading commercial models.
Using these prompts, we generate 2,600 images from 13 state-of-the-art models
and further perform comprehensive human-ranked annotations. Based on LPG-Bench,
we observe that state-of-the-art T2I alignment evaluation metrics exhibit poor
consistency with human preferences on long-prompt-based image generation. To
address the gap, we introduce a novel zero-shot metric based on
text-to-image-to-text consistency, termed TIT, for evaluating
long-prompt-generated images. The core concept of TIT is to quantify T2I
alignment by directly comparing the consistency between the raw prompt and the
LMM-produced description on the generated image, which includes an efficient
score-based instantiation TIT-Score and a large-language-model (LLM) based
instantiation TIT-Score-LLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves superior alignment with human judgment compared to
CLIP-score, LMM-score, etc., with TIT-Score-LLM attaining a 7.31% absolute
improvement in pairwise accuracy over the strongest baseline. LPG-Bench and TIT
methods together offer a deeper perspective to benchmark and foster the
development of T2I models. All resources will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 3DEditVerse, the largest paired 3D editing benchmark, and 3DEditFormer, a novel transformer model that enables precise 3D editing without requiring manual 3D masks, addressing challenges of cross-view consistency and structural fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D editing remains challenging due to cross-view consistency, structural fidelity, and fine-grained controllability requirements. Existing approaches are slow, prone to geometric distortions, or dependent on error-prone manual 3D masks.

Method: Two-pronged approach: (1) Data: created 3DEditVerse benchmark with 116,309 training pairs and 1,500 test pairs using pose-driven geometric edits and foundation model-guided appearance edits; (2) Model: proposed 3DEditFormer transformer with dual-guidance attention and time-adaptive gating to disentangle editable regions from preserved structure.

Result: The framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively, enabling precise and consistent 3D edits without auxiliary 3D masks.

Conclusion: Establishes a new standard for practical and scalable 3D editing, with the dataset and code to be released publicly.

Abstract: 3D editing - the task of locally modifying the geometry or appearance of a 3D
asset - has wide applications in immersive content creation, digital
entertainment, and AR/VR. However, unlike 2D editing, it remains challenging
due to the need for cross-view consistency, structural fidelity, and
fine-grained controllability. Existing approaches are often slow, prone to
geometric distortions, or dependent on manual and accurate 3D masks that are
error-prone and impractical. To address these challenges, we advance both the
data and model fronts. On the data side, we introduce 3DEditVerse, the largest
paired 3D editing benchmark to date, comprising 116,309 high-quality training
pairs and 1,500 curated test pairs. Built through complementary pipelines of
pose-driven geometric edits and foundation model-guided appearance edits,
3DEditVerse ensures edit locality, multi-view consistency, and semantic
alignment. On the model side, we propose 3DEditFormer, a
3D-structure-preserving conditional transformer. By enhancing image-to-3D
generation with dual-guidance attention and time-adaptive gating, 3DEditFormer
disentangles editable regions from preserved structure, enabling precise and
consistent edits without requiring auxiliary 3D masks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines both
quantitatively and qualitatively, establishing a new standard for practical and
scalable 3D editing. Dataset and code will be released. Project:

Motivation: Existing multi-event text-to-video generation methods lack investigation into intrinsic factors controlling event transitions, particularly when and where prompts control event shifts during generation.

Method: Introduces MEve evaluation suite and conducts systematic study of OpenSora and CogVideoX model families, analyzing intervention timing in denoising steps and block-wise model layers.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that early intervention in denoising steps and block-wise model layers are essential for effective multi-event video generation with proper event transitions.

Conclusion: The study reveals key factors for multi-event conditioning in video generation and highlights possibilities for future model development in handling sequential events with temporal coherence.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has surged in response to challenging
questions, especially when a long video must depict multiple sequential events
with temporal coherence and controllable content. Existing methods that extend
to multi-event generation omit an inspection of the intrinsic factor in event
shifting. The paper aims to answer the central question: When and where
multi-event prompts control event transition during T2V generation. This work
introduces MEve, a self-curated prompt suite for evaluating multi-event
text-to-video (T2V) generation, and conducts a systematic study of two
representative model families, i.e., OpenSora and CogVideoX. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the importance of early intervention in denoising steps
and block-wise model layers, revealing the essential factor for multi-event
video generation and highlighting the possibilities for multi-event

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses land cover semantic segmentation in cloud-prone tropical regions by developing a cloud injection algorithm and proposing a lightweight method to inject Normalized Difference Indices (NDIs) into deep learning models to preserve spatial features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing Sentinel-2 datasets are cloud-free, limiting their usefulness in tropical regions where clouds are common. The paper aims to evaluate how Sentinel-1 radar data can fill gaps caused by cloud-obstructed optical imagery and address the loss of spatial/spectral details during encoder downsampling in deep networks.

Method: Developed a cloud injection algorithm to simulate realistic cloud cover, and proposed a lightweight method that injects Normalized Difference Indices (NDIs) into the final decoding layers of deep networks to retain key spatial features with minimal additional computation.

Result: Injecting NDIs enhanced land cover segmentation performance on the DFC2020 dataset, with improvements of 1.99% for U-Net and 2.78% for DeepLabV3 on cloud-free imagery. Under cloud-covered conditions, incorporating Sentinel-1 data led to significant performance gains across all models compared to using optical data alone.

Conclusion: The proposed radar-optical fusion approach is effective in challenging atmospheric scenarios, demonstrating that Sentinel-1 data can successfully complement cloud-obstructed optical imagery for improved land cover segmentation.

Abstract: Supervised deep learning for land cover semantic segmentation (LCS) relies on
labeled satellite data. However, most existing Sentinel-2 datasets are
cloud-free, which limits their usefulness in tropical regions where clouds are
common. To properly evaluate the extent of this problem, we developed a cloud
injection algorithm that simulates realistic cloud cover, allowing us to test
how Sentinel-1 radar data can fill in the gaps caused by cloud-obstructed
optical imagery. We also tackle the issue of losing spatial and/or spectral
details during encoder downsampling in deep networks. To mitigate this loss, we
propose a lightweight method that injects Normalized Difference Indices (NDIs)
into the final decoding layers, enabling the model to retain key spatial
features with minimal additional computation. Injecting NDIs enhanced land
cover segmentation performance on the DFC2020 dataset, yielding improvements of
1.99% for U-Net and 2.78% for DeepLabV3 on cloud-free imagery. Under

TL;DR: Geometry-grounded semantic features in radiance fields contain finer structural details but surprisingly decrease pose estimation accuracy. Visual-only features offer greater versatility for downstream tasks despite geometry-grounded features having more geometric detail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether geometry-grounded semantic features provide advantages over visual-only features in distilled radiance fields for spatial tasks like pose estimation, given the potential promise of visual-geometry features for spatial tasks.

Method: Proposed SPINE framework for radiance field inversion without initial guess, consisting of coarse inversion using distilled semantics and fine inversion using photometric-based optimization. Compared geometry-grounded vs visual-only features across three critical questions.

Result: Geometry-grounded features contain finer structural details but show no significant difference in semantic object localization and surprisingly decrease pose estimation accuracy. Visual-only features offer greater versatility for broader downstream tasks.

Conclusion: While geometry-grounded features contain more geometric detail, visual-only features are more versatile. Future research is needed on effective geometry-grounding strategies that can augment the versatility and performance of pretrained semantic features.

Abstract: Semantic distillation in radiance fields has spurred significant advances in
open-vocabulary robot policies, e.g., in manipulation and navigation, founded
on pretrained semantics from large vision models. While prior work has
demonstrated the effectiveness of visual-only semantic features (e.g., DINO and
CLIP) in Gaussian Splatting and neural radiance fields, the potential benefit
of geometry-grounding in distilled fields remains an open question. In
principle, visual-geometry features seem very promising for spatial tasks such
as pose estimation, prompting the question: Do geometry-grounded semantic
features offer an edge in distilled fields? Specifically, we ask three critical
questions: First, does spatial-grounding produce higher-fidelity geometry-aware
semantic features? We find that image features from geometry-grounded backbones
contain finer structural details compared to their counterparts. Secondly, does
geometry-grounding improve semantic object localization? We observe no
significant difference in this task. Thirdly, does geometry-grounding enable
higher-accuracy radiance field inversion? Given the limitations of prior work
and their lack of semantics integration, we propose a novel framework SPINE for
inverting radiance fields without an initial guess, consisting of two core
components: coarse inversion using distilled semantics, and fine inversion
using photometric-based optimization. Surprisingly, we find that the pose
estimation accuracy decreases with geometry-grounded features. Our results
suggest that visual-only features offer greater versatility for a broader range
of downstream tasks, although geometry-grounded features contain more geometric
detail. Notably, our findings underscore the necessity of future research on
effective strategies for geometry-grounding that augment the versatility and
performance of pretrained semantic features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically understand mechanisms that enable or inhibit compositional generalization in visual generative models, as this ability to generate novel combinations of known concepts is crucial but not fully understood.

Method: Conducted controlled experiments to study how design choices influence compositional generalization, focusing on training objective type (discrete vs. continuous) and conditioning information extent. Proposed relaxing MaskGIT's discrete loss with auxiliary continuous JEPA-based objective.

Result: Identified two key factors affecting compositional generalization: (i) whether training objective operates on discrete or continuous distribution, and (ii) extent of conditioning information about constituent concepts during training.

Conclusion: Auxiliary continuous objectives can improve compositional performance in discrete models like MaskGIT, demonstrating that hybrid approaches combining discrete and continuous training can enhance compositional generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Compositional generalization, the ability to generate novel combinations of
known concepts, is a key ingredient for visual generative models. Yet, not all
mechanisms that enable or inhibit it are fully understood. In this work, we
conduct a systematic study of how various design choices influence
compositional generalization in image and video generation in a positive or
negative way. Through controlled experiments, we identify two key factors: (i)
whether the training objective operates on a discrete or continuous
distribution, and (ii) to what extent conditioning provides information about
the constituent concepts during training. Building on these insights, we show
that relaxing the MaskGIT discrete loss with an auxiliary continuous JEPA-based
objective can improve compositional performance in discrete models like
MaskGIT.

Conclusion: PocketSR provides a highly practical solution for edge-device applications by achieving remarkable speedup while maintaining high-quality super-resolution performance.

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (RealSR) aims to enhance the visual quality
of in-the-wild images, such as those captured by mobile phones. While existing
methods leveraging large generative models demonstrate impressive results, the
high computational cost and latency make them impractical for edge deployment.
In this paper, we introduce PocketSR, an ultra-lightweight, single-step model
that brings generative modeling capabilities to RealSR while maintaining high
fidelity. To achieve this, we design LiteED, a highly efficient alternative to
the original computationally intensive VAE in SD, reducing parameters by 97.5%
while preserving high-quality encoding and decoding. Additionally, we propose
online annealing pruning for the U-Net, which progressively shifts generative
priors from heavy modules to lightweight counterparts, ensuring effective
knowledge transfer and further optimizing efficiency. To mitigate the loss of
prior knowledge during pruning, we incorporate a multi-layer feature
distillation loss. Through an in-depth analysis of each design component, we
provide valuable insights for future research. PocketSR, with a model size of
146M parameters, processes 4K images in just 0.8 seconds, achieving a
remarkable speedup over previous methods. Notably, it delivers performance on
par with state-of-the-art single-step and even multi-step RealSR models, making
it a highly practical solution for edge-device applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mask2IV is a novel framework for interaction-centric video generation that uses a decoupled two-stage pipeline to predict motion trajectories and generate videos without requiring dense mask annotations, achieving superior visual realism and controllability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating interaction-centric videos is crucial for embodied intelligence as they provide visual priors for robot learning and manipulation, but existing methods struggle with complex interactions and require dense mask annotations which are challenging to obtain.

Method: A decoupled two-stage pipeline that first predicts plausible motion trajectories for both actor and object, then generates videos conditioned on these trajectories, eliminating the need for dense mask inputs while supporting versatile control through action descriptions or spatial position cues.

Result: Extensive experiments on curated benchmarks covering human-object interaction and robotic manipulation scenarios demonstrate superior visual realism and controllability compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: Mask2IV provides an effective solution for interaction-centric video generation that overcomes the limitations of dense mask annotations while maintaining flexibility and control over the interaction process.

Abstract: Generating interaction-centric videos, such as those depicting humans or
robots interacting with objects, is crucial for embodied intelligence, as they
provide rich and diverse visual priors for robot learning, manipulation policy
training, and affordance reasoning. However, existing methods often struggle to
model such complex and dynamic interactions. While recent studies show that
masks can serve as effective control signals and enhance generation quality,
obtaining dense and precise mask annotations remains a major challenge for
real-world use. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Mask2IV, a novel
framework specifically designed for interaction-centric video generation. It
adopts a decoupled two-stage pipeline that first predicts plausible motion
trajectories for both actor and object, then generates a video conditioned on
these trajectories. This design eliminates the need for dense mask inputs from
users while preserving the flexibility to manipulate the interaction process.
Furthermore, Mask2IV supports versatile and intuitive control, allowing users
to specify the target object of interaction and guide the motion trajectory
through action descriptions or spatial position cues. To support systematic
training and evaluation, we curate two benchmarks covering diverse action and
object categories across both human-object interaction and robotic manipulation
scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior
visual realism and controllability compared to existing baselines.

### [42] [HAVIR: HierArchical Vision to Image Reconstruction using CLIP-Guided Versatile Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03122)
*Shiyi Zhang,Dong Liang,Hairong Zheng,Yihang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HAVIR model reconstructs visual information from brain activity by separating visual cortex into hierarchical regions, extracting structural and semantic features separately, and integrating them via Versatile Diffusion for improved image reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to accurately reconstruct complex visual stimuli due to heterogeneity in low-level features and semantic entanglement in high-level features of natural scenes.

Method: Separates visual cortex into two hierarchical regions: Structural Generator extracts structural information from spatial processing voxels as latent diffusion priors, and Semantic Extractor converts semantic processing voxels into CLIP embeddings, integrated via Versatile Diffusion model.

Result: HAVIR enhances both structural and semantic quality of reconstructions, even in complex scenes, and outperforms existing models.

Conclusion: The hierarchical approach inspired by visual cortex representation theory effectively addresses challenges in brain activity-based visual reconstruction.

Abstract: The reconstruction of visual information from brain activity fosters
interdisciplinary integration between neuroscience and computer vision.
However, existing methods still face challenges in accurately recovering highly
complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from the characteristics of
natural scenes: low-level features exhibit heterogeneity, while high-level
features show semantic entanglement due to contextual overlaps. Inspired by the
hierarchical representation theory of the visual cortex, we propose the HAVIR
model, which separates the visual cortex into two hierarchical regions and
extracts distinct features from each. Specifically, the Structural Generator
extracts structural information from spatial processing voxels and converts it
into latent diffusion priors, while the Semantic Extractor converts semantic
processing voxels into CLIP embeddings. These components are integrated via the
Versatile Diffusion model to synthesize the final image. Experimental results
demonstrate that HAVIR enhances both the structural and semantic quality of
reconstructions, even in complex scenes, and outperforms existing models.

Motivation: Spine disorders affect 619M people globally and are a leading cause of disability, but AI-assisted diagnosis is limited by lack of level-aware multimodal datasets and standardized benchmarks for vertebral-level reasoning across X-ray, CT, and MRI.

Method: Co-designed with spine surgeons, using clinician-in-the-loop pipeline with two-stage LLM generation (draft and revision) to create SpineMed-450k from diverse sources including textbooks, guidelines, open datasets, and ~1,000 hospital cases.

Result: Evaluation of advanced LVLMs on SpineBench reveals systematic weaknesses in fine-grained, level-specific reasoning, while model fine-tuned on SpineMed-450k shows consistent significant improvements across all tasks, confirmed by clinician assessments.

Conclusion: SpineMed addresses critical gaps in spine AI diagnosis by providing traceable, clinically-grounded instruction data and standardized benchmarks, enabling improved vertebral-level reasoning across imaging modalities for enhanced clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Spine disorders affect 619 million people globally and are a leading cause of
disability, yet AI-assisted diagnosis remains limited by the lack of
level-aware, multimodal datasets. Clinical decision-making for spine disorders
requires sophisticated reasoning across X-ray, CT, and MRI at specific
vertebral levels. However, progress has been constrained by the absence of
traceable, clinically-grounded instruction data and standardized,
spine-specific benchmarks. To address this, we introduce SpineMed, an ecosystem
co-designed with practicing spine surgeons. It features SpineMed-450k, the
first large-scale dataset explicitly designed for vertebral-level reasoning
across imaging modalities with over 450,000 instruction instances, and
SpineBench, a clinically-grounded evaluation framework. SpineMed-450k is
curated from diverse sources, including textbooks, guidelines, open datasets,
and ~1,000 de-identified hospital cases, using a clinician-in-the-loop pipeline
with a two-stage LLM generation method (draft and revision) to ensure
high-quality, traceable data for question-answering, multi-turn consultations,
and report generation. SpineBench evaluates models on clinically salient axes,
including level identification, pathology assessment, and surgical planning.
Our comprehensive evaluation of several recently advanced large vision-language
models (LVLMs) on SpineBench reveals systematic weaknesses in fine-grained,
level-specific reasoning. In contrast, our model fine-tuned on SpineMed-450k
demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across all tasks.
Clinician assessments confirm the diagnostic clarity and practical utility of
our model's outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic images have become increasingly realistic, posing significant societal risks like misinformation and fraud. Existing domain-specific detection methods have limited practical applicability due to narrow specialization, poor cross-domain generalization, and lack of integrated adaptive framework.

Method: UniShield integrates a perception agent that intelligently analyzes image features to dynamically select suitable detection models, and a detection agent that consolidates various expert detectors into a unified framework and generates interpretable reports.

Conclusion: UniShield demonstrates superior practicality, adaptiveness, and scalability for detecting and localizing image forgeries across diverse domains.

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in image generation, synthetic images have become
increasingly realistic, posing significant societal risks, such as
misinformation and fraud. Forgery Image Detection and Localization (FIDL) thus
emerges as essential for maintaining information integrity and societal
security. Despite impressive performances by existing domain-specific detection
methods, their practical applicability remains limited, primarily due to their
narrow specialization, poor cross-domain generalization, and the absence of an
integrated adaptive framework. To address these issues, we propose UniShield,
the novel multi-agent-based unified system capable of detecting and localizing
image forgeries across diverse domains, including image manipulation, document
manipulation, DeepFake, and AI-generated images. UniShield innovatively
integrates a perception agent with a detection agent. The perception agent
intelligently analyzes image features to dynamically select suitable detection
models, while the detection agent consolidates various expert detectors into a
unified framework and generates interpretable reports. Extensive experiments
show that UniShield achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both existing
unified approaches and domain-specific detectors, highlighting its superior
practicality, adaptiveness, and scalability.

### [46] [Latent Diffusion Unlearning: Protecting Against Unauthorized Personalization Through Trajectory Shifted Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03089)
*Naresh Kumar Devulapally,Shruti Agarwal,Tejas Gokhale,Vishnu Suresh Lokhande*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a latent space perturbation method for diffusion models that makes training images "unlearnable" to prevent unauthorized personalization while maintaining high visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy and IP protection concerns in text-to-image diffusion models by preventing unauthorized model personalization using poisoned training data.

Method: A model-based perturbation strategy in latent space that alternates between denoising and inversion while modifying the starting point of the denoising trajectory in diffusion models.

Result: Achieves significant improvements in imperceptibility (8-10% on perceptual metrics) and robustness (10% average across adversarial settings) against state-of-the-art inversion attacks.

Conclusion: The proposed trajectory-shifted sampling provides an effective and imperceptible defense against unauthorized model adaptation in diffusion models.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in
rapid and high-fidelity personalization, even when provided with only a few
user images. However, the effectiveness of personalization techniques has lead
to concerns regarding data privacy, intellectual property protection, and
unauthorized usage. To mitigate such unauthorized usage and model replication,
the idea of generating ``unlearnable'' training samples utilizing image
poisoning techniques has emerged. Existing methods for this have limited
imperceptibility as they operate in the pixel space which results in images
with noise and artifacts. In this work, we propose a novel model-based
perturbation strategy that operates within the latent space of diffusion
models. Our method alternates between denoising and inversion while modifying
the starting point of the denoising trajectory: of diffusion models. This
trajectory-shifted sampling ensures that the perturbed images maintain high
visual fidelity to the original inputs while being resistant to inversion and
personalization by downstream generative models. This approach integrates
unlearnability into the framework of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), enabling a
practical and imperceptible defense against unauthorized model adaptation. We
validate our approach on four benchmark datasets to demonstrate robustness
against state-of-the-art inversion attacks. Results demonstrate that our method
achieves significant improvements in imperceptibility ($\sim 8 \% -10\%$ on
perceptual metrics including PSNR, SSIM, and FID) and robustness ( $\sim 10\%$
on average across five adversarial settings), highlighting its effectiveness in
safeguarding sensitive data.

*Dong Lao,Yuxiang Zhang,Haniyeh Ehsani Oskouie,Yangchao Wu,Alex Wong,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free test-time defense method that uses stochastic resonance with small translational perturbations to combat adversarial attacks, achieving state-of-the-art robustness across image classification, stereo matching, and optical flow tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defense methods rely on feature filtering or smoothing which can cause information loss. The paper aims to develop a defense that enhances robustness while minimizing information degradation.

Method: Introduces small translational perturbations to input images, aligns the transformed feature embeddings, aggregates them, and maps back to the original reference image using a closed-form formula. The method requires no additional network modules or fine-tuning.

Result: Recovers up to 68.1% of accuracy loss on image classification, 71.9% on stereo matching, and 29.2% on optical flow under various adversarial attacks. Establishes the first generic test-time defense for dense prediction tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free, architecture-agnostic, and attack-agnostic method effectively combats adversarial attacks using stochastic resonance, demonstrating versatility and practicality across multiple computer vision tasks.

Abstract: We propose a test-time defense mechanism against adversarial attacks:
imperceptible image perturbations that significantly alter the predictions of a
model. Unlike existing methods that rely on feature filtering or smoothing,
which can lead to information loss, we propose to "combat noise with noise" by
leveraging stochastic resonance to enhance robustness while minimizing
information loss. Our approach introduces small translational perturbations to
the input image, aligns the transformed feature embeddings, and aggregates them
before mapping back to the original reference image. This can be expressed in a
closed-form formula, which can be deployed on diverse existing network
architectures without introducing additional network modules or fine-tuning for
specific attack types. The resulting method is entirely training-free,
architecture-agnostic, and attack-agnostic. Empirical results show
state-of-the-art robustness on image classification and, for the first time,
establish a generic test-time defense for dense prediction tasks, including
stereo matching and optical flow, highlighting the method's versatility and
practicality. Specifically, relative to clean (unperturbed) performance, our
method recovers up to 68.1% of the accuracy loss on image classification, 71.9%
on stereo matching, and 29.2% on optical flow under various types of
adversarial attacks.

### [48] [Improving GUI Grounding with Explicit Position-to-Coordinate Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03230)
*Suyuchen Wang,Tianyu Zhang,Ahmed Masry,Christopher Pal,Spandana Gella,Bang Liu,Perouz Taslakian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RULER tokens and I-MRoPE to improve GUI grounding accuracy by providing explicit spatial guidance instead of relying on implicit coordinate generation, especially for high-resolution displays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with GUI grounding due to unreliable patch-to-pixel mapping when extrapolating to unseen high-resolution displays, leading to accuracy degradation and failures.

Method: Two innovations: 1) RULER tokens as explicit coordinate markers for position referencing, and 2) Interleaved MRoPE (I-MRoPE) for balanced spatial encoding of width and height dimensions.

Result: Experiments on ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-V2, and ScreenSpot-Pro show consistent gains in grounding accuracy, with largest improvements on high-resolution interfaces.

Conclusion: By providing explicit spatial guidance rather than relying on implicit learning, the approach enables more reliable GUI automation across diverse resolutions and platforms.

Abstract: GUI grounding, the task of mapping natural-language instructions to pixel
coordinates, is crucial for autonomous agents, yet remains difficult for
current VLMs. The core bottleneck is reliable patch-to-pixel mapping, which
breaks when extrapolating to high-resolution displays unseen during training.
Current approaches generate coordinates as text tokens directly from visual
features, forcing the model to infer complex position-to-pixel mappings
implicitly; as a result, accuracy degrades and failures proliferate on new
resolutions. We address this with two complementary innovations. First, RULER
tokens serve as explicit coordinate markers, letting the model reference
positions similar to gridlines on a map and adjust rather than generate
coordinates from scratch. Second, Interleaved MRoPE (I-MRoPE) improves spatial
encoding by ensuring that width and height dimensions are represented equally,
addressing the asymmetry of standard positional schemes. Experiments on
ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-V2, and ScreenSpot-Pro show consistent gains in
grounding accuracy, with the largest improvements on high-resolution
interfaces. By providing explicit spatial guidance rather than relying on
implicit learning, our approach enables more reliable GUI automation across
diverse resolutions and platforms.

### [49] [GeoComplete: Geometry-Aware Diffusion for Reference-Driven Image Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03110)
*Beibei Lin,Tingting Chen,Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoComplete is a novel framework for reference-driven image completion that incorporates explicit 3D structural guidance through a dual-branch diffusion architecture and target-aware masking to ensure geometric consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative methods for image completion rely solely on diffusion priors without geometric cues, often producing misaligned or implausible content when target views differ significantly from references.

Method: Uses a dual-branch diffusion architecture: one branch synthesizes missing regions from masked target, another extracts geometric features from projected point clouds. Joint self-attention ensures coherence. Target-aware masking identifies occluded areas to focus on relevant reference cues.

Result: Achieves 17.1 PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods, significantly boosting geometric accuracy while maintaining high visual quality.

Conclusion: GeoComplete provides a unified and robust solution for geometry-conditioned image completion by integrating geometry-aware dual-branch diffusion with target-aware masking strategy.

Abstract: Reference-driven image completion, which restores missing regions in a target
view using additional images, is particularly challenging when the target view
differs significantly from the references. Existing generative methods rely
solely on diffusion priors and, without geometric cues such as camera pose or
depth, often produce misaligned or implausible content. We propose GeoComplete,
a novel framework that incorporates explicit 3D structural guidance to enforce
geometric consistency in the completed regions, setting it apart from prior
image-only approaches. GeoComplete introduces two key ideas: conditioning the
diffusion process on projected point clouds to infuse geometric information,
and applying target-aware masking to guide the model toward relevant reference
cues. The framework features a dual-branch diffusion architecture. One branch
synthesizes the missing regions from the masked target, while the other
extracts geometric features from the projected point cloud. Joint
self-attention across branches ensures coherent and accurate completion. To
address regions visible in references but absent in the target, we project the
target view into each reference to detect occluded areas, which are then masked
during training. This target-aware masking directs the model to focus on useful
cues, enhancing performance in difficult scenarios. By integrating a
geometry-aware dual-branch diffusion architecture with a target-aware masking
strategy, GeoComplete offers a unified and robust solution for
geometry-conditioned image completion. Experiments show that GeoComplete
achieves a 17.1 PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods, significantly
boosting geometric accuracy while maintaining high visual quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel framework for Text-to-Sounding-Video generation that addresses modal interference through disentangled captions and introduces a dual-tower diffusion transformer with bidirectional cross-attention for synchronized audio-video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Text-to-Sounding-Video generation methods face two key challenges: modal interference from shared text captions confusing pretrained backbones, and unclear optimal mechanisms for cross-modal feature interaction between audio and video.

Method: The authors propose Hierarchical Visual-Grounded Captioning (HVGC) to generate disentangled video and audio captions, and BridgeDiT - a dual-tower diffusion transformer with Dual CrossAttention (DCA) mechanism for bidirectional information exchange between modalities.

Result: Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show state-of-the-art performance on most metrics, with human evaluations and ablation studies validating the effectiveness of the proposed components.

Conclusion: The method successfully addresses modal interference and achieves semantic-temporal synchronization, offering key insights for future Text-to-Sounding-Video research. All codes and checkpoints will be publicly released.

Abstract: This study focuses on a challenging yet promising task,
Text-to-Sounding-Video (T2SV) generation, which aims to generate a video with
synchronized audio from text conditions, meanwhile ensuring both modalities are
aligned with text. Despite progress in joint audio-video training, two critical
challenges still remain unaddressed: (1) a single, shared text caption where
the text for video is equal to the text for audio often creates modal
interference, confusing the pretrained backbones, and (2) the optimal mechanism
for cross-modal feature interaction remains unclear. To address these
challenges, we first propose the Hierarchical Visual-Grounded Captioning (HVGC)
framework that generates pairs of disentangled captions, a video caption, and
an audio caption, eliminating interference at the conditioning stage. Based on
HVGC, we further introduce BridgeDiT, a novel dual-tower diffusion transformer,
which employs a Dual CrossAttention (DCA) mechanism that acts as a robust
``bridge" to enable a symmetric, bidirectional exchange of information,
achieving both semantic and temporal synchronization. Extensive experiments on
three benchmark datasets, supported by human evaluations, demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art results on most metrics. Comprehensive
ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our contributions,
offering key insights for the future T2SV task. All the codes and checkpoints
will be publicly released.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on TensoIR and Stanford-ORB datasets across most metrics, and demonstrates effectiveness on real-world object captures.

Conclusion: ROGR enables efficient feed-forward relighting under arbitrary environment maps and advances the state-of-the-art in relightable 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: We introduce ROGR, a novel approach that reconstructs a relightable 3D model
of an object captured from multiple views, driven by a generative relighting
model that simulates the effects of placing the object under novel environment
illuminations. Our method samples the appearance of the object under multiple
lighting environments, creating a dataset that is used to train a
lighting-conditioned Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) that outputs the object's
appearance under any input environmental lighting. The lighting-conditioned
NeRF uses a novel dual-branch architecture to encode the general lighting

enables efficient feed-forward relighting under arbitrary environment maps
without requiring per-illumination optimization or light transport simulation.
We evaluate our approach on the established TensoIR and Stanford-ORB datasets,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PQGAN integrates product quantization into VQGAN framework, achieving significant improvements in image reconstruction quality and enabling higher resolution or faster generation in diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Product quantization has been underutilized for latent representations in high-fidelity image generation despite its scalability, while existing methods have limitations in reconstruction performance.

Method: Integrates product quantization into the VQGAN framework, analyzing interactions between codebook size, embedding dimensionality, and subspace factorization, with vector and scalar quantization as special cases.

Result: Achieves PSNR of 37dB (vs 27dB prior), reduces FID, LPIPS, and CMMD scores by up to 96%, and enables either faster generation or doubled output resolution in diffusion models.

Conclusion: Product quantization is a strong extension for discrete latent representations in image synthesis, with novel findings about scaling behavior and optimal hyperparameter selection.

Abstract: Product quantisation (PQ) is a classical method for scalable vector encoding,
yet it has seen limited usage for latent representations in high-fidelity image
generation. In this work, we introduce PQGAN, a quantised image autoencoder
that integrates PQ into the well-known vector quantisation (VQ) framework of
VQGAN. PQGAN achieves a noticeable improvement over state-of-the-art methods in
terms of reconstruction performance, including both quantisation methods and
their continuous counterparts. We achieve a PSNR score of 37dB, where prior
work achieves 27dB, and are able to reduce the FID, LPIPS, and CMMD score by up
to 96%. Our key to success is a thorough analysis of the interaction between
codebook size, embedding dimensionality, and subspace factorisation, with
vector and scalar quantisation as special cases. We obtain novel findings, such
that the performance of VQ and PQ behaves in opposite ways when scaling the
embedding dimension. Furthermore, our analysis shows performance trends for PQ
that help guide optimal hyperparameter selection. Finally, we demonstrate that
PQGAN can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained diffusion models. This
enables either a significantly faster and more compute-efficient generation, or
a doubling of the output resolution at no additional cost, positioning PQ as a
strong extension for discrete latent representation in image synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Memory Forcing is a learning framework for autoregressive video diffusion models that improves long-term spatial consistency in Minecraft gameplay generation by combining temporal and spatial memory with specialized training protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autoregressive video diffusion models struggle with maintaining spatial consistency when revisiting explored areas while also generating natural new content during exploration, creating a trade-off between temporal-only memory (lacks consistency) and spatial memory (may degrade new scene quality).

Method: Memory Forcing combines: 1) Hybrid Training that exposes different gameplay regimes to guide memory usage, 2) Chained Forward Training with model rollouts to encourage spatial memory reliance, 3) Point-to-Frame Retrieval for efficient history access, and 4) Incremental 3D Reconstruction for maintaining an explicit 3D cache.

Result: Extensive experiments show Memory Forcing achieves superior long-term spatial consistency and generative quality across diverse environments while maintaining computational efficiency for extended sequences.

Conclusion: The proposed Memory Forcing framework successfully addresses the trade-off between spatial consistency and new scene generation quality in autoregressive video diffusion models for world modeling applications.

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models have proved effective for world
modeling and interactive scene generation, with Minecraft gameplay as a
representative application. To faithfully simulate play, a model must generate
natural content while exploring new scenes and preserve spatial consistency
when revisiting explored areas. Under limited computation budgets, it must
compress and exploit historical cues within a finite context window, which
exposes a trade-off: Temporal-only memory lacks long-term spatial consistency,
whereas adding spatial memory strengthens consistency but may degrade new scene
generation quality when the model over-relies on insufficient spatial context.
We present Memory Forcing, a learning framework that pairs training protocols
with a geometry-indexed spatial memory. Hybrid Training exposes distinct
gameplay regimes, guiding the model to rely on temporal memory during
exploration and incorporate spatial memory for revisits. Chained Forward
Training extends autoregressive training with model rollouts, where chained
predictions create larger pose variations and encourage reliance on spatial
memory for maintaining consistency. Point-to-Frame Retrieval efficiently
retrieves history by mapping currently visible points to their source frames,
while Incremental 3D Reconstruction maintains and updates an explicit 3D cache.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Memory Forcing achieves superior
long-term spatial consistency and generative quality across diverse
environments, while maintaining computational efficiency for extended
sequences.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonSTeR is the first MOtioN-Scene-TExt Retrieval model that creates a unified latent space to capture dependencies between skeletal movement, surrounding context, and intention, enabling flexible cross-modal retrieval and outperforming unimodal approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research lacks tools to evaluate alignment between skeletal movement (motion), intention (text), and surrounding context (scene), despite the intuitive relationship between these modalities in human movement.

Method: Constructs a unified latent space by leveraging unimodal and cross-modal representations, inspired by higher-order relations modeling to capture intricate dependencies between motion, scene, and text modalities.

Result: MonSTeR outperforms trimodal models relying solely on unimodal representations, and user study validates alignment with human preferences. Demonstrates versatility through zero-shot in-Scene Object Placement and Motion Captioning.

Conclusion: MonSTeR successfully addresses the gap in evaluating motion-text-scene alignment, providing a robust framework for cross-modal retrieval that captures complex dependencies between human movement, intention, and environmental context.

Abstract: Intention drives human movement in complex environments, but such movement
can only happen if the surrounding context supports it. Despite the intuitive
nature of this mechanism, existing research has not yet provided tools to
evaluate the alignment between skeletal movement (motion), intention (text),
and the surrounding context (scene). In this work, we introduce MonSTeR, the
first MOtioN-Scene-TExt Retrieval model. Inspired by the modeling of
higher-order relations, MonSTeR constructs a unified latent space by leveraging
unimodal and cross-modal representations. This allows MonSTeR to capture the
intricate dependencies between modalities, enabling flexible but robust
retrieval across various tasks. Our results show that MonSTeR outperforms
trimodal models that rely solely on unimodal representations. Furthermore, we
validate the alignment of our retrieval scores with human preferences through a
dedicated user study. We demonstrate the versatility of MonSTeR's latent space
on zero-shot in-Scene Object Placement and Motion Captioning. Code and
pre-trained models are available at github.com/colloroneluca/MonSTeR.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
general visual benchmarks but struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks in
specialized domains such as medical imaging, where labeled data is limited and
expensive. We introduce LEAML, a label-efficient adaptation framework that

selectively update only those neurons most relevant to question-answering,
enabling the QA Generator to efficiently acquire domain-specific knowledge
during distillation. Experiments on gastrointestinal endoscopy and sports VQA
demonstrate that LEAML consistently outperforms standard fine-tuning under
minimal supervision, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed LEAML

Abstract: We propose the Extended Reality Universal Planning Toolkit (ERUPT), an
extended reality (XR) system for interactive motion planning. Our system allows
users to create and dynamically reconfigure environments while they plan robot
paths. In immersive three-dimensional XR environments, users gain a greater
spatial understanding. XR also unlocks a broader range of natural interaction
capabilities, allowing users to grab and adjust objects in the environment
similarly to the real world, rather than using a mouse and keyboard with the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing driving scene manipulation frameworks struggle with limited editing capabilities and inefficient generation of realistic scenarios, creating a need for more intuitive and flexible editing tools.

Method: Uses language-aligned Gaussian splatting to reconstruct scenes and enable natural language control, supporting object-level editing (adding objects, modifying trajectories) with multi-agent motion prediction for realistic interactions.

Result: Experiments on Waymo dataset demonstrate extensive editing capabilities and adaptability across various scenarios, showing improved realism and flexibility compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: SIMSplat provides an effective solution for driving scene manipulation with intuitive language control, detailed object-level editing, and realistic motion prediction, advancing the field of driving simulation.

Abstract: Driving scene manipulation with sensor data is emerging as a promising
alternative to traditional virtual driving simulators. However, existing

*Anamika J H,Anujith Muraleedharan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: U-LAG is a mid-execution goal-retargeting system that adapts robot task goals in real-time to handle perception delays and environmental changes, using uncertainty-aware pose estimation to maintain manipulation success under object shifts and sensing lag.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots operating in dynamic environments face challenges with late, noisy, or stale perception data, which can cause manipulation failures when objects move during execution.

Method: U-LAG introduces UAR-PF, an uncertainty-aware retargeter that maintains a distribution over object pose under sensing lag and selects goals that maximize expected progress. It acts as a pluggable module between perception and control without changing the low-level controller.

Result: In tests with 0-10 cm object shifts and 0-400 ms perception lags, UAR-PF achieved higher success rates with modest end-effector travel and fewer aborts compared to baseline methods, degrading gracefully under increasing stress conditions.

Conclusion: The system provides effective mid-execution goal retargeting for manipulation tasks, with operational safeguards improving stability, and establishes a reproducible benchmark for evaluating manipulation under perception delays.

Abstract: Robots manipulating in changing environments must act on percepts that are
late, noisy, or stale. We present U-LAG, a mid-execution goal-retargeting layer
that leaves the low-level controller unchanged while re-aiming task goals
(pre-contact, contact, post) as new observations arrive. Unlike motion
retargeting or generic visual servoing, U-LAG treats in-flight goal re-aiming
as a first-class, pluggable module between perception and control. Our main
technical contribution is UAR-PF, an uncertainty-aware retargeter that
maintains a distribution over object pose under sensing lag and selects goals
that maximize expected progress. We instantiate a reproducible Shift x Lag
stress test in PyBullet/PandaGym for pick, push, stacking, and peg insertion,
where the object undergoes abrupt in-plane shifts while synthetic perception
lag is injected during approach. Across 0-10 cm shifts and 0-400 ms lags,
UAR-PF and ICP degrade gracefully relative to a no-retarget baseline, achieving
higher success with modest end-effector travel and fewer aborts; simple
operational safeguards further improve stability. Contributions: (1) UAR-PF for
lag-adaptive, uncertainty-aware goal retargeting; (2) a pluggable retargeting
interface; and (3) a reproducible Shift x Lag benchmark with evaluation on
pick, push, stacking, and peg insertion.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A bilinear Koopman operator-based MPC framework for mobile robot navigation that achieves 320x faster computation than nonlinear MPC while maintaining collision avoidance capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional Koopman approaches only linearize system dynamics, but fail to handle collision-avoidance constraints. There's a need for global linear representations that include both nonlinear dynamics and safety constraints.

Method: Uses extended dynamic mode decomposition to identify linear and bilinear Koopman models from data. Formulates path planning as a quadratic program in lifted space with MPC framework. Bilinear models capture nonlinear state-input couplings essential for collision avoidance.

Result: Bilinear Koopman models accurately capture nonlinear couplings and quadratic terms for collision avoidance, while linear models fail. Achieves 320x faster computation than nonlinear MPC while maintaining safety.

Conclusion: Bilinear Koopman realizations enable efficient linearization of highly nonlinear optimal control problems with nonlinear constraints, achieving computational efficiency similar to linear problems while preserving safety-critical capabilities.

Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven model predictive control framework for
mobile robots navigating in dynamic environments, leveraging Koopman operator
theory. Unlike the conventional Koopman-based approaches that focus on the
linearization of system dynamics only, our work focuses on finding a global
linear representation for the optimal path planning problem that includes both
the nonlinear robot dynamics and collision-avoidance constraints. We deploy
extended dynamic mode decomposition to identify linear and bilinear Koopman
realizations from input-state data. Our open-loop analysis demonstrates that
only the bilinear Koopman model can accurately capture nonlinear state-input
couplings and quadratic terms essential for collision avoidance, whereas linear
realizations fail to do so. We formulate a quadratic program for the robot path
planning in the presence of moving obstacles in the lifted space and determine
the optimal robot action in an MPC framework. Our approach is capable of
finding the safe optimal action 320 times faster than a nonlinear MPC
counterpart that solves the path planning problem in the original state space.
Our work highlights the potential of bilinear Koopman realizations for
linearization of highly nonlinear optimal control problems subject to nonlinear
state and input constraints to achieve computational efficiency similar to
linear problems.

Method: Proposed SubSense framework with non-invasive haptic feedback interface for 1-DOF manipulator paired with teleoperator's glove, plus end-to-end software for VR control and immersive camera views.

Result: Comprehensive experiments and user studies demonstrate effectiveness over conventional interfaces, particularly for delicate manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: Multisensory feedback in immersive virtual environments significantly improves remote situational awareness and mission performance, offering more intuitive and accessible ROV operations.

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of haptic feedback and virtual

of underwater ROVs (remotely operated vehicles). Traditional ROV teleoperation
relies on low-resolution 2D camera feeds and lacks immersive and sensory

Abstract: We introduce UMI-on-Air, a framework for embodiment-aware deployment of

unconstrained human demonstrations collected with a handheld gripper (UMI) to
train generalizable visuomotor policies. A central challenge in transferring
these policies to constrained robotic embodiments-such as aerial

to out-of-distribution behaviors and poor execution. To address this, we
propose Embodiment-Aware Diffusion Policy (EADP), which couples a high-level
UMI policy with a low-level embodiment-specific controller at inference time.
By integrating gradient feedback from the controller's tracking cost into the

Motivation: Traditional visual SLAM methods assume static environments and struggle in dynamic settings, which limits their practical application in real-world scenarios like social robotics where moving objects are common.

Method: Incorporates deep learning-based semantic segmentation with Extended Kalman filtering to identify both moving and temporarily idle dynamic objects. Uses a generative network to fill missing image regions from removed dynamic objects. Implemented as a modular ROS-based framework.

Result: Achieves around 22 fps on GTX1080 hardware. Benchmarking on TUM dataset dynamic sequences shows competitive localization error compared to state-of-the-art methods while operating in near real-time.

Conclusion: The proposed semantic RGBD SLAM system effectively handles dynamic environments by combining semantic information with filtering techniques, delivering robust performance suitable for real-world robotics applications.

Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) plays an important role in many
robotics fields, including social robots. Many of the available visual SLAM
methods are based on the assumption of a static world and struggle in dynamic
environments. In the current study, we introduce a real-time semantic RGBD SLAM
approach designed specifically for dynamic environments. Our proposed system
can effectively detect moving objects and maintain a static map to ensure
robust camera tracking. The key innovation of our approach is the incorporation
of deep learning-based semantic information into SLAM systems to mitigate the
impact of dynamic objects. Additionally, we enhance the semantic segmentation
process by integrating an Extended Kalman filter to identify dynamic objects
that may be temporarily idle. We have also implemented a generative network to
fill in the missing regions of input images belonging to dynamic objects. This
highly modular framework has been implemented on the ROS platform and can
achieve around 22 fps on a GTX1080. Benchmarking the developed pipeline on

Conclusion: Proposed algorithm successfully enables trajectory following without prior dynamics knowledge by combining local learning and reachability guarantees.

Abstract: This paper proposes an algorithm capable of driving a system to follow a

despite not knowing the system dynamics. The proposed algorithm first applies
small perturbations to locally learn the system dynamics around the current

locally learned dynamics and their corresponding maximum growth-rate bounds,
and finally synthesizes a control action that navigates the system to a
guaranteed reachable state.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel 'hold-and-hit' communication-control framework for multi-robot rigid formation navigation that handles wireless network delays and enables precise curvilinear path following under nonholonomic constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in comprehensive solutions for multi-robot formation navigation on microprocessor platforms via wireless networks, especially for complex curvilinear paths.

Method: Combines a 'hold-and-hit' communication-control framework with intra-cycle optimization. The framework synchronizes robot movements robust to network delays/packet loss using discrete-time cycles, while optimization enables precise curvilinear path following under nonholonomic constraints.

Result: Simulations show superiority in maintaining four-robot square formation along S-shaped paths. Real-world experiments achieved inter-distance error within ±0.069m and inter-angular orientation error within ±19.15° at 0.1 m/s velocity.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables precise and reliable multi-robot formation navigation in challenging scenarios with wireless communication constraints and complex paths.

Abstract: Rigid-formation navigation of multiple robots is essential for applications
such as cooperative transportation. This process involves a team of
collaborative robots maintaining a predefined geometric configuration, such as
a square, while in motion. For untethered collaborative motion, inter-robot
communication must be conducted through a wireless network. Notably, few
existing works offer a comprehensive solution for multi-robot formation
navigation executable on microprocessor platforms via wireless networks,
particularly for formations that must traverse complex curvilinear paths. To
address this gap, we introduce a novel "hold-and-hit" communication-control
framework designed to work seamlessly with the widely-used Robotic Operating
System (ROS) platform. The hold-and-hit framework synchronizes robot movements
in a manner robust against wireless network delays and packet loss. It operates
over discrete-time communication-control cycles, making it suitable for
implementation on contemporary microprocessors. Complementary to hold-and-hit,
we propose an intra-cycle optimization approach that enables rigid formations
to closely follow desired curvilinear paths, even under the nonholonomic
movement constraints inherent to most vehicular robots. The combination of
hold-and-hit and intra-cycle optimization ensures precise and reliable
navigation even in challenging scenarios. Simulations in a virtual environment
demonstrate the superiority of our method in maintaining a four-robot square
formation along an S-shaped path, outperforming two existing approaches.
Furthermore, real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of our
framework: the robots maintained an inter-distance error within $\pm 0.069m$
and an inter-angular orientation error within $\pm19.15^{\circ}$ while
navigating along an S-shaped path at a fixed linear velocity of $0.1 m/s$.

TL;DR: A novel trajectory generation framework that enhances scenario density and behavioral diversity for autonomous driving by converting road environments into structured grid representations and using behavior-aware generation with Frenet-based smoothing and feasibility constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmark datasets suffer from long-tail distribution problems with underrepresentation of high-density scenarios and safety-critical maneuvers like lane changes and overtaking, leading to poor model generalization and overly optimistic evaluations.

Method: Convert continuous road environments into structured grid representation for fine-grained path planning, conflict detection, and multi-agent coordination. Use behavior-aware generation combining rule-based decision triggers with Frenet-based trajectory smoothing and dynamic feasibility constraints.

Result: Extensive experiments on Argoverse 1 and 2 datasets show significant improvements in agent density and behavior diversity while preserving motion realism and scenario-level safety. Synthetic data benefits downstream trajectory prediction models in challenging high-density scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the long-tail distribution problem in trajectory prediction datasets by generating realistic high-density scenarios and rare behaviors with complex interactions, improving model generalization and evaluation realism.

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction is fundamental to autonomous driving, as it
underpins safe motion planning and collision avoidance in complex environments.
However, existing benchmark datasets suffer from a pronounced long-tail
distribution problem, with most samples drawn from low-density scenarios and
simple straight-driving behaviors. This underrepresentation of high-density
scenarios and safety critical maneuvers such as lane changes, overtaking and
turning is an obstacle to model generalization and leads to overly optimistic
evaluations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel trajectory
generation framework that simultaneously enhances scenarios density and
enriches behavioral diversity. Specifically, our approach converts continuous
road environments into a structured grid representation that supports
fine-grained path planning, explicit conflict detection, and multi-agent
coordination. Built upon this representation, we introduce behavior-aware
generation mechanisms that combine rule-based decision triggers with
Frenet-based trajectory smoothing and dynamic feasibility constraints. This
design allows us to synthesize realistic high-density scenarios and rare
behaviors with complex interactions that are often missing in real data.
Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets
demonstrate that our method significantly improves both agent density and
behavior diversity, while preserving motion realism and scenario-level safety.
Our synthetic data also benefits downstream trajectory prediction models and
enhances performance in challenging high-density scenarios.

TL;DR: iLLM-A* is an improved version of LLM-A* that addresses computational bottlenecks in large-scale grid map path planning by optimizing A* algorithm, implementing incremental learning for LLM waypoint generation, and selecting appropriate waypoints, achieving over 1000× speedup and significant memory savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing path planning methods like A* and Dijkstra struggle with large-scale maps due to high computational time and memory consumption. While LLM-A* showed promise by combining LLMs with A*, it still suffers from performance limitations in large-scale scenarios.

Method: The paper proposes iLLM-A* with three key mechanisms: 1) optimization of the A* algorithm, 2) incremental learning method for LLM to generate high-quality waypoints, and 3) selection of appropriate waypoints for A* path planning.

Result: iLLM-A* achieves over 1000× speedup on average (up to 2349.5× in extreme cases), saves up to 58.6% memory cost, and produces shorter paths with lower path length standard deviation compared to LLM-A*.

Conclusion: iLLM-A* successfully addresses the computational bottlenecks of LLM-A* and provides an efficient solution for large-scale grid map path planning with significant performance improvements in speed, memory usage, and path quality.

Abstract: Path planning in grid maps, arising from various applications, has garnered
significant attention. Existing methods, such as A*, Dijkstra, and their
variants, work well for small-scale maps but fail to address large-scale ones
due to high search time and memory consumption. Recently, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in path planning but still suffer from
spatial illusion and poor planning performance. Among all the works, LLM-A*
\cite{meng2024llm} leverages LLM to generate a series of waypoints and then
uses A* to plan the paths between the neighboring waypoints. In this way, the
complete path is constructed. However, LLM-A* still suffers from high
computational time for large-scale maps. To fill this gap, we conducted a deep
investigation into LLM-A* and found its bottleneck, resulting in limited
performance. Accordingly, we design an innovative LLM-enhanced algorithm, abbr.
as iLLM-A*. iLLM-A* includes 3 carefully designed mechanisms, including the
optimization of A*, an incremental learning method for LLM to generate
high-quality waypoints, and the selection of the appropriate waypoints for A*
for path planning. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation on various grid maps
shows that, compared with LLM-A*, iLLM-A* \textbf{1) achieves more than
$1000\times$ speedup on average, and up to $2349.5\times$ speedup in the
extreme case, 2) saves up to $58.6\%$ of the memory cost, 3) achieves both
obviously shorter path length and lower path length standard deviation.}

### [71] [Team Xiaomi EV-AD VLA: Caption-Guided Retrieval System for Cross-Modal Drone Navigation -- Technical Report for IROS 2025 RoboSense Challenge Track 4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02728)

TL;DR: Proposed a two-stage retrieval refinement method (CGRS) that enhances drone navigation by using vision-language models to generate detailed captions for coarse-ranked images, then performing fine-grained reranking through multimodal similarity computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-modal drone navigation faces challenges in achieving fine-grained semantic matching between text queries and visual content, especially in complex aerial scenes where current baseline methods struggle with semantic accuracy.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Baseline model generates coarse ranking of top 20 images per query, 2) VLM generates detailed captions for candidate images, 3) Multimodal similarity computation performs fine-grained reranking using generated captions as semantic bridge.

Result: Achieved consistent 5% improvement across all key metrics (Recall@1, Recall@5, Recall@10) and won TOP-2 position in RoboSense 2025 Track 4 challenge.

Conclusion: The semantic refinement strategy using caption-guided retrieval significantly enhances cross-modal drone navigation performance and demonstrates practical value in real-world robotic navigation scenarios.

Abstract: Cross-modal drone navigation remains a challenging task in robotics,
requiring efficient retrieval of relevant images from large-scale databases
based on natural language descriptions. The RoboSense 2025 Track 4 challenge
addresses this challenge, focusing on robust, natural language-guided
cross-view image retrieval across multiple platforms (drones, satellites, and
ground cameras). Current baseline methods, while effective for initial
retrieval, often struggle to achieve fine-grained semantic matching between
text queries and visual content, especially in complex aerial scenes. To
address this challenge, we propose a two-stage retrieval refinement method:
Caption-Guided Retrieval System (CGRS) that enhances the baseline coarse
ranking through intelligent reranking. Our method first leverages a baseline
model to obtain an initial coarse ranking of the top 20 most relevant images
for each query. We then use Vision-Language-Model (VLM) to generate detailed
captions for these candidate images, capturing rich semantic descriptions of
their visual content. These generated captions are then used in a multimodal
similarity computation framework to perform fine-grained reranking of the
original text query, effectively building a semantic bridge between the visual
content and natural language descriptions. Our approach significantly improves
upon the baseline, achieving a consistent 5\% improvement across all key
metrics (Recall@1, Recall@5, and Recall@10). Our approach win TOP-2 in the
challenge, demonstrating the practical value of our semantic refinement
strategy in real-world robotic navigation scenarios.

*Tianyu Li,Yihan Li,Zizhe Zhang,Nadia Figueroa*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A framework for generating force-informed synthetic data from single human demonstrations, combined with compliant policies to improve visuomotor policy performance in contact-rich manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contact-rich robotic manipulation tasks require explicit handling of compliance and force, but most visuomotor policies ignore compliance, leading to excessive contact forces or fragile behavior. Force information could help but requires extensive data, and simulation data generation faces Sim2Real gap challenges.

Method: Developed a framework for generating force-informed data in simulation using only a single human demonstration, and coupled it with compliant policies to enhance visuomotor policy learning from synthetic data.

Result: Validated on real-robot tasks including non-prehensile block flipping and bi-manual object moving, showing reliable contact maintenance and adaptation to novel conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully bridges the gap between simulation and reality for contact-rich tasks by incorporating force information and compliance, enabling robust performance with minimal human demonstrations.

Abstract: While visuomotor policy has made advancements in recent years, contact-rich
tasks still remain a challenge. Robotic manipulation tasks that require
continuous contact demand explicit handling of compliance and force. However,
most visuomotor policies ignore compliance, overlooking the importance of
physical interaction with the real world, often leading to excessive contact
forces or fragile behavior under uncertainty. Introducing force information
into vision-based imitation learning could help improve awareness of contacts,
but could also require a lot of data to perform well. One remedy for data
scarcity is to generate data in simulation, yet computationally taxing
processes are required to generate data good enough not to suffer from the
Sim2Real gap. In this work, we introduce a framework for generating
force-informed data in simulation, instantiated by a single human
demonstration, and show how coupling with a compliant policy improves the
performance of a visuomotor policy learned from synthetic data. We validate our
approach on real-robot tasks, including non-prehensile block flipping and a
bi-manual object moving, where the learned policy exhibits reliable contact
maintenance and adaptation to novel conditions. Project Website:

TL;DR: REACT-Drive is a trajectory planning framework that integrates Visual Language Models with Retrieval-Augmented Generation to improve autonomous driving in work zones, reducing average displacement error by 3x compared to VLM baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Visual Language Models fail in 68% of work zone trajectory planning cases due to irregular layouts, temporary traffic control, and dynamically changing geometric structures in work zones.

Method: REACT-Drive uses VLM to convert prior failure cases into constraint rules and executable code, while RAG retrieves similar patterns in new scenarios to guide trajectory generation.

Result: REACT-Drive reduces average displacement error by 3x compared to VLM baselines, achieves lowest inference time (0.58s vs 17.90s for fine-tuning), and demonstrates strong performance in 15 real-world work zone scenarios.

Conclusion: REACT-Drive effectively addresses VLM failures in work zone trajectory planning through constraint-based retrieval and code generation, showing strong practicality for real-world autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs), with powerful multimodal reasoning
capabilities, are gradually integrated into autonomous driving by several
automobile manufacturers to enhance planning capability in challenging
environments. However, the trajectory planning capability of VLMs in work
zones, which often include irregular layouts, temporary traffic control, and
dynamically changing geometric structures, is still unexplored. To bridge this
gap, we conduct the \textit{first} systematic study of VLMs for work zone
trajectory planning, revealing that mainstream VLMs fail to generate correct
trajectories in $68.0%$ of cases. To better understand these failures, we first
identify candidate patterns via subgraph mining and clustering analysis, and
then confirm the validity of $8$ common failure patterns through human
verification. Building on these findings, we propose REACT-Drive, a trajectory
planning framework that integrates VLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG). Specifically, REACT-Drive leverages VLMs to convert prior failure cases
into constraint rules and executable trajectory planning code, while RAG
retrieves similar patterns in new scenarios to guide trajectory generation.
Experimental results on the ROADWork dataset show that REACT-Drive yields a
reduction of around $3\times$ in average displacement error relative to VLM
baselines under evaluation with Qwen2.5-VL. In addition, REACT-Drive yields the
lowest inference time ($0.58$s) compared with other methods such as fine-tuning
($17.90$s). We further conduct experiments using a real vehicle in 15 work zone
scenarios in the physical world, demonstrating the strong practicality of
REACT-Drive.

TL;DR: A closed-loop FES controller for foot drop dynamically adjusts stimulation based on real-time toe clearance, maintaining adequate toe clearance with lower stimulation intensity than traditional open-loop controllers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional open-loop FES controllers for foot drop use fixed stimulation intensities that risk overstimulation (causing fatigue and discomfort) or understimulation (compromising dorsiflexion and increasing fall risk).

Method: A closed-loop FES controller that dynamically adjusts stimulation intensity based on real-time toe clearance, evaluated by inducing foot drop in healthy participants and comparing with traditional open-loop controllers across various walking conditions (different speeds and surface inclinations).

Result: The closed-loop controller maintains adequate toe clearance without significantly affecting hip, knee, and ankle joint angles, while using significantly lower stimulation intensities compared to the open-loop controller.

Conclusion: The proposed closed-loop FES controller matches the effectiveness of existing systems while offering potential benefits of reduced muscle fatigue and improved long-term user comfort and adherence.

Abstract: Foot drop is commonly managed using Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES),
typically delivered via open-loop controllers with fixed stimulation
intensities. While users may manually adjust the intensity through external
controls, this approach risks overstimulation, leading to muscle fatigue and
discomfort, or understimulation, which compromises dorsiflexion and increases
fall risk. In this study, we propose a novel closed-loop FES controller that
dynamically adjusts the stimulation intensity based on real-time toe clearance,
providing "assistance as needed". We evaluate this system by inducing foot drop
in healthy participants and comparing the effects of the closed-loop controller
with a traditional open-loop controller across various walking conditions,
including different speeds and surface inclinations. Kinematic data reveal that
our closed-loop controller maintains adequate toe clearance without
significantly affecting the joint angles of the hips, the knees, and the
ankles, and while using significantly lower stimulation intensities compared to
the open-loop controller. These findings suggest that the proposed method not
only matches the effectiveness of existing systems but also offers the
potential for reduced muscle fatigue and improved long-term user comfort and
adherence.

*Jeyoung Park,Yeonsub Lim,Seungeun Oh,Jihong Park,Jinho Choi,Seong-Lyun Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes Action Deviation-Aware Hybrid Inference for distributed ML in 6G networks, which selectively skips server verification based on action deviation estimates to reduce latency while maintaining high task success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable low-latency distributed ML for embodied AI applications like autonomous driving and robot manipulation, where traditional speculative decoding cannot be directly applied due to sequential action dependencies.

Method: Action deviation-aware hybrid inference where the draft model estimates an action's need for verification/correction by the target model, selectively skipping communication and server operations based on a derived path deviation threshold.

Result: Reduces uplink transmission and server operation by 40%, lowers end-to-end latency by 33.32% compared to hybrid inference without skipping, and achieves task success rate up to 97.03% of target model only inference.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively reduces latency and resource usage for distributed ML in embodied AI applications while maintaining near-optimal task performance, addressing the limitations of traditional speculative decoding in sequential action environments.

Abstract: To support latency-sensitive AI applications ranging from autonomous driving
to industrial robot manipulation, 6G envisions distributed ML, connecting
distributed computational resources in edge and cloud over hyper-reliable
low-latency communication (HRLLC). In this setting, speculative decoding can
facilitate collaborative inference of models distributively deployed: an
on-device draft model locally generates drafts and a remote server-based target
model verifies and corrects them, resulting lower latency. However, unlike
autoregressive text generation, behavior cloning policies, typically used for
embodied AI applications like robot manipulation and autonomous driving, cannot
parallelize verification and correction for multiple drafts as each action
depends on observation which needs to be updated by a previous action. To this
end, we propose Action Deviation-Aware Hybrid Inference, wherein the draft
model estimates an action's need for verification and correction by the target
model and selectively skips communication and computation for server
operations. Action deviation shows a strong correlation with action's rejection
probability by the target model, enabling selective skipping. We derive the
path deviation threshold that balances the transmission rate and the inference
performance, and we empirically show that action deviation-aware hybrid
inference reduces uplink transmission and server operation by 40%, while
lowering end-to-end latency by 33.32% relative to hybrid inference without
skipping and achieving task success rate up to 97.03% of that of target model
only inference.

*Charith Premachandra,U-Xuan Tan*

TL;DR: This paper proposes using UWB radar-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging for mobile robot mapping in poor visibility conditions, and evaluates classical feature detectors for loop closure detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sensors like LiDARs and cameras struggle in poor visibility conditions (dust, smoke, rain), while UWB radar can see through these adverse conditions but has low directivity with single scans.

Method: The paper proposes a pipeline that synthesizes a virtual large aperture by moving UWB radar along a mobile robot path to create high-definition SAR images, then evaluates SIFT, SURF, BRISK, AKAZE and ORB feature detectors for loop closure detection.

Result: Experiments conducted in adverse environmental conditions demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of UWB SAR imaging for high-resolution environmental mapping and loop closure detection.

Conclusion: UWB SAR imaging provides a robust and reliable solution for robotic perception systems in challenging visibility conditions, enabling high-resolution mapping and successful loop closure detection.

Abstract: Traditional exteroceptive sensors in mobile robots, such as LiDARs and
cameras often struggle to perceive the environment in poor visibility
conditions. Recently, radar technologies, such as ultra-wideband (UWB) have
emerged as potential alternatives due to their ability to see through adverse
environmental conditions (e.g. dust, smoke and rain). However, due to the small
apertures with low directivity, the UWB radars cannot reconstruct a detailed
image of its field of view (FOV) using a single scan. Hence, a virtual large
aperture is synthesized by moving the radar along a mobile robot path. The
resulting synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image is a high-definition
representation of the surrounding environment. Hence, this paper proposes a
pipeline for mobile robots to incorporate UWB radar-based SAR imaging to map an
unknown environment. Finally, we evaluated the performance of classical feature
detectors: SIFT, SURF, BRISK, AKAZE and ORB to identify loop closures using UWB
SAR images. The experiments were conducted emulating adverse environmental
conditions. The results demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of UWB SAR
imaging for high-resolution environmental mapping and loop closure detection
toward more robust and reliable robotic perception systems.

TL;DR: A novel motion planning algorithm for autonomous mobile robots that integrates dynamic obstacle tracking with Kalman filters and forward-time-domain mapping, combined with control barrier functions and nonlinear model predictive control for safe navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable safety-critical navigation for autonomous mobile robots in complex environments with both static and dynamic obstacles, addressing the need for real-time obstacle avoidance and robust motion planning.

Method: Integrates real-time dynamic obstacle tracking and mapping that categorizes point clouds into dynamic/static components. Uses Kalman filter for motion state estimation/prediction of dynamic obstacles, constructs forward-time-domain (FTD) maps, and combines control barrier functions (CBFs) with nonlinear model predictive control for collision avoidance.

Result: Experimental results from simulations and real-world scenarios demonstrate effective obstacle avoidance in complex environments. Superior performance compared to two baseline approaches in terms of safety and robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm successfully enables autonomous robots to navigate safely in dynamic environments by integrating real-time obstacle tracking, motion prediction, and safety-constrained control optimization.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel motion planning algorithm to facilitate
safety-critical navigation for autonomous mobile robots. The proposed algorithm
integrates a real-time dynamic obstacle tracking and mapping system that
categorizes point clouds into dynamic and static components. For dynamic point
clouds, the Kalman filter is employed to estimate and predict their motion
states. Based on these predictions, we extrapolate the future states of dynamic
point clouds, which are subsequently merged with static point clouds to
construct the forward-time-domain (FTD) map. By combining control barrier
functions (CBFs) with nonlinear model predictive control, the proposed
algorithm enables the robot to effectively avoid both static and dynamic
obstacles. The CBF constraints are formulated based on risk points identified
through collision detection between the predicted future states and the FTD
map. Experimental results from both simulated and real-world scenarios
demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in complex environments. In
simulation experiments, the proposed algorithm is compared with two baseline
approaches, showing superior performance in terms of safety and robustness in
obstacle avoidance. The source code is released for the reference of the
robotics community.

TL;DR: This paper investigates correlations between numerical social navigation metrics and human-centered evaluations to identify if quantitative measures can replace costly survey-based assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social navigation evaluation is complex and human-centered assessments are reliable but costly and difficult to reproduce, while numerical metrics lack standardization and consensus.

Method: The work explores relationships between numerical metrics and human-centered evaluations to identify potential correlations that could serve as standardized evaluation tools.

Result: Results show current metrics capture some aspects of robot navigation behavior but important subjective factors remain insufficiently represented, indicating need for new metrics.

Conclusion: While numerical metrics show promise for reducing dependency on surveys, current metrics are insufficient and new metrics are necessary to better capture subjective factors in social navigation evaluation.

Abstract: Social, also called human-aware, navigation is a key challenge for the
integration of mobile robots into human environments. The evaluation of such
systems is complex, as factors such as comfort, safety, and legibility must be
considered. Human-centered assessments, typically conducted through surveys,
provide reliable insights but are costly, resource-intensive, and difficult to
reproduce or compare across systems. Alternatively, numerical social navigation
metrics are easy to compute and facilitate comparisons, yet the community lacks
consensus on a standard set of metrics.
  This work explores the relationship between numerical metrics and
human-centered evaluations to identify potential correlations. If specific
quantitative measures align with human perceptions, they could serve as
standardized evaluation tools, reducing the dependency on surveys. Our results
indicate that while current metrics capture some aspects of robot navigation
behavior, important subjective factors remain insufficiently represented and
new metrics are necessary.

TL;DR: A minimal brachiation robot with single rigid rod and grippers uses crank-slide mechanism to reposition center of mass, with optimal bang-bang and continuous control strategies developed and experimentally validated.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a minimal configuration brachiation robot that can perform swing and rotation motions on horizontal bars using center of mass repositioning.

Method: Designed a robot with single rigid rod and grippers at both ends, using crank-slide mechanism for center of mass repositioning. Developed optimal bang-bang control and continuous control strategies based on non-linear model and input-output linearization.

Result: Both control strategies were validated in simulations, with continuous control implemented on STM32-based system. Experimental validation successfully demonstrated swing and rotation stages of brachiation motion.

Conclusion: The proposed minimal brachiation robot design and control strategies effectively enable swing and rotation motions, with particular focus on energy accumulation for subsequent jump stages.

Abstract: A complete mechatronic design of a minimal configuration brachiation robot is
presented. The robot consists of a single rigid rod with gripper mechanisms
attached to both ends. The grippers are used to hang the robot on a horizontal
bar on which it swings or rotates. The motion is imposed by repositioning the
robot's center of mass, which is performed using a crank-slide mechanism. Based
on a non-linear model, an optimal control strategy is proposed, for
repositioning the center of mass in a bang-bang manner. Consequently, utilizing
the concept of input-output linearization, a continuous control strategy is
proposed that takes into account the limited torque of the crank-slide
mechanism and its geometry. An increased attention is paid to energy
accumulation towards the subsequent jump stage of the brachiation. These two
strategies are validated and compared in simulations. The continuous control
strategy is then also implemented within a low-cost STM32-based control system,
and both the swing and rotation stages of the brachiation motion are
experimentally validated.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise lateral motion modeling and decoupled control in hover is challenging for tail-sitter UAVs due to complex aerodynamic couplings and undefined lateral dynamics.

Method: Introduces sideslip force model from differential propeller slipstream effects, uses YXZ Euler rotation for attitude representation, and directly controls yaw in y-axis to improve lateral dynamics without singularities.

Result: Validated through Unity-based simulations showing stable performance on rectangular and circular paths with low position errors and yaw deviations under 5.688 degrees.

Conclusion: The proposed lateral force generation model is effective and provides foundation for developing agile hover-capable tail-sitter UAVs.

Abstract: Achieving precise lateral motion modeling and decoupled control in hover
remains a significant challenge for tail-sitter Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs), primarily due to complex aerodynamic couplings and the absence of
welldefined lateral dynamics. This paper presents a novel modeling and control
strategy that enhances yaw authority and lateral motion by introducing a
sideslip force model derived from differential propeller slipstream effects
acting on the fuselage under differential thrust. The resulting lateral force
along the body y-axis enables yaw-based lateral position control without
inducing roll coupling. The control framework employs a YXZ Euler rotation
formulation to accurately represent attitude and incorporate gravitational
components while directly controlling yaw in the yaxis, thereby improving
lateral dynamic behavior and avoiding singularities. The proposed approach is
validated through trajectory-tracking simulations conducted in a Unity-based
environment. Tests on both rectangular and circular paths in hover mode
demonstrate stable performance, with low mean absolute position errors and yaw
deviations constrained within 5.688 degrees. These results confirm the
effectiveness of the proposed lateral force generation model and provide a
foundation for the development of agile, hover-capable tail-sitter UAVs.

Motivation: To accurately estimate position and orientation of flexible manipulators during vertical motion using cost-effective IMUs, overcoming noise and delay issues in conventional methods.

Method: Model flexible links as rigid segments, estimate joint angles from IMU data, use PSO-optimized complementary filter for sensor fusion, and apply RBFNN for residual error compensation.

Result: Achieved RMSE of 0.00021 m (y), 0.00041 m (z), and 0.00024 rad (θ) in experimental validation, demonstrating high estimation accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed intelligent multi-IMU kinematic estimation method effectively estimates flexible manipulator pose with high precision using optimized sensor fusion and neural network compensation.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for estimating the position and
orientation of flexible manipulators undergoing vertical motion using multiple
inertial measurement units (IMUs), optimized and calibrated with ground truth
data. The flexible links are modeled as a series of rigid segments, with joint
angles estimated from accelerometer and gyroscope measurements acquired by
cost-effective IMUs. A complementary filter is employed to fuse the
measurements, with its parameters optimized through particle swarm optimization
(PSO) to mitigate noise and delay. To further improve estimation accuracy,
residual errors in position and orientation are compensated using radial basis
function neural networks (RBFNN). Experimental results validate the
effectiveness of the proposed intelligent multi-IMU kinematic estimation
method, achieving root mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.00021~m, 0.00041~m, and

Result: Controller demonstrated highly desirable performance in tracking different trajectories with remarkable improvement in both speed and accuracy compared to existing NMPC controllers.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides stable, accurate real-time control for skid-steered mobile platforms, outperforming existing nonlinear model-predictive controllers.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for real-time optimal controlling of a
heavy-duty skid-steered mobile platform for trajectory tracking. The importance
of accurate real-time performance of the controller lies in safety
considerations of situations where the dynamic system under control is affected
by uncertainties and disturbances, and the controller should compensate for
such phenomena in order to provide stable performance. A multiple-shooting
nonlinear model-predictive control framework is proposed in this paper. This
framework benefits from suitable algorithm along with readings from various
sensors for genuine real-time performance with extremely high accuracy. The
controller is then tested for tracking different trajectories where it
demonstrates highly desirable performance in terms of both speed and accuracy.
This controller shows remarkable improvement when compared to existing
nonlinear model-predictive controllers in the literature that were implemented
on skid-steered mobile platforms.

TL;DR: Diffusion models enable end-to-end generation of smooth, high-coverage trajectories for industrial tasks like polishing, painting, and spray coating, outperforming conventional methods by 98.2% in Chamfer Distance and 61% in surface coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional trajectory generation methods are constrained by predefined functional forms, limiting their ability to handle complex tasks and requiring manual redesign for new scenarios. Diffusion models offer more expressive generative capabilities for flexible trajectory adaptation.

Method: An end-to-end diffusion-based framework that iteratively denoises trajectories using learned noise schedules and conditioning mechanisms to ensure smooth motion and task adaptation.

Result: The method improves Point-wise Chamfer Distance by 98.2%, smoothness by 97.0%, and surface coverage by 61% compared to prior methods, while generalizing to unseen shapes without category-specific models.

Conclusion: Diffusion models provide a unified approach for end-to-end trajectory learning across industrial surface-processing tasks, overcoming limitations of conventional methods and enabling flexible adaptation to diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Diffusion models, as a class of deep generative models, have recently emerged
as powerful tools for robot skills by enabling stable training with reliable
convergence. In this paper, we present an end-to-end framework for generating
long, smooth trajectories that explicitly target high surface coverage across
various industrial tasks, including polishing, robotic painting, and spray
coating. The conventional methods are always fundamentally constrained by their
predefined functional forms, which limit the shapes of the trajectories they
can represent and make it difficult to handle complex and diverse tasks.
Moreover, their generalization is poor, often requiring manual redesign or
extensive parameter tuning when applied to new scenarios. These limitations
highlight the need for more expressive generative models, making
diffusion-based approaches a compelling choice for trajectory generation. By
iteratively denoising trajectories with carefully learned noise schedules and
conditioning mechanisms, diffusion models not only ensure smooth and consistent
motion but also flexibly adapt to the task context. In experiments, our method
improves trajectory continuity, maintains high coverage, and generalizes to

TL;DR: HumanoidExo transfers human motion to whole-body humanoid data to address the scarcity of humanoid training data, enabling robots to learn complex tasks with minimal real-robot demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost and difficulty of collecting reliable real-world humanoid data creates a significant bottleneck in humanoid policy learning, limiting dataset scale and diversity.

Method: HumanoidExo system that transfers human motion to whole-body humanoid data, minimizing the embodiment gap between human demonstrators and robots.

Result: Enabled humanoid policies to generalize to novel environments, learn complex whole-body control from only 5 real-robot demos, and acquire new skills like walking solely from HumanoidExo data.

Conclusion: HumanoidExo is a crucial addition to real-robot data that significantly enhances humanoid robot performance in dynamic real-world scenarios by providing voluminous and diverse training data.

Abstract: A significant bottleneck in humanoid policy learning is the acquisition of
large-scale, diverse datasets, as collecting reliable real-world data remains
both difficult and cost-prohibitive. To address this limitation, we introduce
HumanoidExo, a novel system that transfers human motion to whole-body humanoid
data. HumanoidExo offers a high-efficiency solution that minimizes the
embodiment gap between the human demonstrator and the robot, thereby tackling
the scarcity of whole-body humanoid data. By facilitating the collection of
more voluminous and diverse datasets, our approach significantly enhances the
performance of humanoid robots in dynamic, real-world scenarios. We evaluated
our method across three challenging real-world tasks: table-top manipulation,
manipulation integrated with stand-squat motions, and whole-body manipulation.
Our results empirically demonstrate that HumanoidExo is a crucial addition to
real-robot data, as it enables the humanoid policy to generalize to novel
environments, learn complex whole-body control from only five real-robot
demonstrations, and even acquire new skills (i.e., walking) solely from
HumanoidExo data.

Conclusion: MoD-LHMP provides an effective framework for long-term human motion prediction that leverages environmental motion patterns, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods and practical utility for robotics applications.

Abstract: Long-term human motion prediction (LHMP) is important for the safe and
efficient operation of autonomous robots and vehicles in environments shared
with humans. Accurate predictions are important for applications including
motion planning, tracking, human-robot interaction, and safety monitoring. In
this paper, we exploit Maps of Dynamics (MoDs), which encode spatial or
spatio-temporal motion patterns as environment features, to achieve LHMP for
horizons of up to 60 seconds. We propose an MoD-informed LHMP framework that
supports various types of MoDs and includes a ranking method to output the most
likely predicted trajectory, improving practical utility in robotics. Further,
a time-conditioned MoD is introduced to capture motion patterns that vary
across different times of day. We evaluate MoD-LHMP instantiated with three
types of MoDs. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that MoD-informed
method outperforms learning-based ones, with up to 50\% improvement in average
displacement error, and the time-conditioned variant achieves the highest

TL;DR: This position paper advocates for co-designing both control policies and physical structures of humanoid robots, inspired by biological evolution, to achieve true embodied intelligence through iterative adaptation of form and behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research focuses mainly on optimizing control for fixed robot structures, but humanoid robots need to integrate both intelligent control and adaptive morphology to operate effectively in diverse real-world environments.

Method: Proposes practical co-design methodologies using strategic exploration, Sim2Real transfer, and meta-policy learning, analyzing co-design from methodological, application-driven, and community-oriented perspectives.

Result: Presents co-design as a cornerstone for developing next-generation intelligent humanoid agents and provides open research questions spanning from short-term innovations to long-term goals.

Conclusion: Co-design of control strategies and physical structure is essential for achieving true embodied intelligence in humanoid robotics, representing an underexplored but promising domain that requires further investigation.

Abstract: Humanoid robots, as general-purpose physical agents, must integrate both
intelligent control and adaptive morphology to operate effectively in diverse
real-world environments. While recent research has focused primarily on
optimizing control policies for fixed robot structures, this position paper
argues for evolving both control strategies and humanoid robots' physical
structure under a co-design mechanism. Inspired by biological evolution, this
approach enables robots to iteratively adapt both their form and behavior to
optimize performance within task-specific and resource-constrained contexts.
Despite its promise, co-design in humanoid robotics remains a relatively
underexplored domain, raising fundamental questions about its feasibility and
necessity in achieving true embodied intelligence. To address these challenges,
we propose practical co-design methodologies grounded in strategic exploration,
Sim2Real transfer, and meta-policy learning. We further argue for the essential
role of co-design by analyzing it from methodological, application-driven, and
community-oriented perspectives. Striving to guide and inspire future studies,
we present open research questions, spanning from short-term innovations to
long-term goals. This work positions co-design as a cornerstone for developing
the next generation of intelligent and adaptable humanoid agents.

TL;DR: A 3.2-gram whisker-based tactile sensing system for tiny drones enables vision-free navigation through physical contact, inspired by how animals like rats use whiskers to perceive surroundings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tiny flying robots have potential for search-and-rescue and environmental monitoring, but their small size limits conventional sensing, especially in poor lighting, smoke, dust, or with reflective obstacles where vision fails.

Method: Bio-inspired whisker-based tactile sensing apparatus using barometer-based whisker sensors to detect obstacle locations while minimizing destabilization. Includes tactile depth estimation method to address sensor noise and drift, running fully onboard a 192-KB RAM microcontroller.

Result: Achieves sub-6 mm depth estimation accuracy, enabling drones to navigate, contour obstacles, and explore confined spaces solely through touch even in total darkness along both soft and rigid surfaces. Validated in both simulation and real-world tests.

Conclusion: The bio-inspired approach redefines vision-free navigation, opening new possibilities for micro aerial vehicles in extreme environments where conventional sensing fails.

Abstract: Tiny flying robots hold great potential for search-and-rescue, safety
inspections, and environmental monitoring, but their small size limits
conventional sensing-especially with poor-lighting, smoke, dust or reflective
obstacles. Inspired by nature, we propose a lightweight, 3.2-gram,
whisker-based tactile sensing apparatus for tiny drones, enabling them to
navigate and explore through gentle physical interaction. Just as rats and
moles use whiskers to perceive surroundings, our system equips drones with
tactile perception in flight, allowing obstacle sensing even in pitch-dark
conditions. The apparatus uses barometer-based whisker sensors to detect
obstacle locations while minimising destabilisation. To address sensor noise
and drift, we develop a tactile depth estimation method achieving sub-6 mm
accuracy. This enables drones to navigate, contour obstacles, and explore
confined spaces solely through touch-even in total darkness along both soft and
rigid surfaces. Running fully onboard a 192-KB RAM microcontroller, the system
supports autonomous tactile flight and is validated in both simulation and
real-world tests. Our bio-inspired approach redefines vision-free navigation,
opening new possibilities for micro aerial vehicles in extreme environments.

### [88] [Learning Stability Certificate for Robotics in Real-World Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03123)
*Zhe Shen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A framework that learns Lyapunov functions from trajectory data to certify stability of autonomous systems without needing system dynamics knowledge, using neural networks and Cholesky factorization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional stability certification requires explicit system dynamics knowledge, which is challenging for complex, unknown systems. This work aims to enable stability certification from data alone.

Method: Parameterize Lyapunov candidate using neural network, ensure positive definiteness through Cholesky factorization, and allow controlled violations of stability conditions to handle noisy real-world data.

Result: The framework successfully provides data-driven stability guarantees and can certify system stability without access to internal control algorithms.

Conclusion: This approach offers a robust method for certifying robotic system safety in dynamic environments and is applicable even when system behavior is opaque or proprietary.

Abstract: Stability certificates play a critical role in ensuring the safety and
reliability of robotic systems. However, deriving these certificates for
complex, unknown systems has traditionally required explicit knowledge of
system dynamics, often making it a daunting task. This work introduces a novel
framework that learns a Lyapunov function directly from trajectory data,
enabling the certification of stability for autonomous systems without needing
detailed system models. By parameterizing the Lyapunov candidate using a neural
network and ensuring positive definiteness through Cholesky factorization, our
approach automatically identifies whether the system is stable under the given
trajectory. To address the challenges posed by noisy, real-world data, we allow
for controlled violations of the stability condition, focusing on maintaining
high confidence in the stability certification process. Our results demonstrate
that this framework can provide data-driven stability guarantees, offering a
robust method for certifying the safety of robotic systems in dynamic,
real-world environments. This approach works without access to the internal
control algorithms, making it applicable even in situations where system
behavior is opaque or proprietary. The tool for learning the stability proof is
open-sourced by this research: https://github.com/HansOersted/stability.

*Tianyu Xu,Jiawei Chen,Jiazhao Zhang,Wenyao Zhang,Zekun Qi,Minghan Li,Zhizheng Zhang,He Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes MM-Nav, a Vision-Language-Action model for visual navigation that learns from synthetic expert data in a teacher-student manner, achieving strong generalization and outperforming RL teachers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual navigation using egocentric observations is promising but challenging due to the difficulty in explicitly modeling optical information, requiring intelligent models and large-scale data.

Method: Implemented MM-Nav as a multi-view VLA model based on pretrained LLMs and visual foundation models, trained iteratively with dynamically balanced data from three RL experts specialized in different navigation capabilities (reaching, squeezing, avoiding).

Result: The model achieves strong generalization in synthetic environments and outperforms RL teachers, demonstrating synergistic effects of integrating multiple capabilities. Real-world experiments confirm effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed teacher-student VLA approach successfully leverages synthetic expert data to develop robust visual navigation policies that generalize well and exceed the performance of individual RL experts.

Abstract: Visual navigation policy is widely regarded as a promising direction, as it
mimics humans by using egocentric visual observations for navigation. However,
optical information of visual observations is difficult to be explicitly
modeled like LiDAR point clouds or depth maps, which subsequently requires
intelligent models and large-scale data. To this end, we propose to leverage
the intelligence of the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model to learn diverse
navigation capabilities from synthetic expert data in a teacher-student manner.
Specifically, we implement the VLA model, MM-Nav, as a multi-view VLA (with 360
observations) based on pretrained large language models and visual foundation
models. For large-scale navigation data, we collect expert data from three
reinforcement learning (RL) experts trained with privileged depth information
in three challenging tailor-made environments for different navigation
capabilities: reaching, squeezing, and avoiding. We iteratively train our VLA
model using data collected online from RL experts, where the training ratio is
dynamically balanced based on performance on individual capabilities. Through
extensive experiments in synthetic environments, we demonstrate that our model
achieves strong generalization capability. Moreover, we find that our student
VLA model outperforms the RL teachers, demonstrating the synergistic effect of
integrating multiple capabilities. Extensive real-world experiments further
confirm the effectiveness of our method.

*Duanjiao Li,Yun Chen,Ying Zhang,Junwen Yao,Dongyue Huang,Jianguo Zhang,Ning Ding*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An optimal smooth coverage trajectory planning algorithm for UAVs in power grid scenarios, using GA for TSP optimization and nonlinear least squares for trajectory smoothing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable UAVs to efficiently cover Points of Interest (POIs) in cluttered power grid environments while ensuring smooth trajectories, time efficiency, and obstacle avoidance.

Method: Two-stage approach: front-end uses Genetic Algorithm to solve TSP for POI sequence optimization, back-end formulates trajectory smoothness, time, and obstacle avoidance as nonlinear least squares problem.

Result: Numerical simulations validate the algorithm's effectiveness in producing smooth coverage trajectories that allow UAVs to cover all POIs in cluttered environments.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm successfully generates optimal smooth coverage trajectories for UAVs in power grid scenarios, addressing both path optimization and trajectory quality constraints.

Abstract: For typical applications of UAVs in power grid scenarios, we construct the
problem as planning UAV trajectories for coverage in cluttered environments. In
this paper, we propose an optimal smooth coverage trajectory planning
algorithm. The algorithm consists of two stages. In the front-end, a Genetic
Algorithm (GA) is employed to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for
Points of Interest (POIs), generating an initial sequence of optimized visiting
points. In the back-end, the sequence is further optimized by considering
trajectory smoothness, time consumption, and obstacle avoidance. This is
formulated as a nonlinear least squares problem and solved to produce a smooth
coverage trajectory that satisfies these constraints. Numerical simulations
validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, ensuring UAVs can
smoothly cover all POIs in cluttered environments.

### [91] [Simulation to Rules: A Dual-VLM Framework for Formal Visual Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03182)
*Yilun Hao,Yongchao Chen,Chuchu Fan,Yang Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VLMFP is a dual-VLM framework that autonomously generates both PDDL problem and domain files for visual planning, overcoming limitations of prior methods that required human-defined domain files or constant environment access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Language Models (VLMs) struggle with precise spatial and long-horizon reasoning for visual planning, while PDDL planners excel at formal planning but cannot interpret visual inputs. Prior methods combining VLMs and PDDL still required human experts to predefine domain files or constant environment access for refinement.

Method: VLMFP uses two VLMs: SimVLM that simulates action consequences based on input rule descriptions, and GenVLM that generates and iteratively refines PDDL files by comparing PDDL and SimVLM execution results. This enables autonomous generation of both PDDL problem and domain files.

Result: SimVLM accurately describes 95.5% of scenarios for seen appearances and 82.6% for unseen appearances, simulates 85.5% and 87.8% of action sequences respectively, and judges 82.4% and 85.6% goal reaching. VLMFP generates PDDL files that achieve 70.0% valid plans for unseen instances with seen appearances and 54.1% for unseen appearances.

Conclusion: VLMFP successfully enables autonomous generation of both PDDL problem and domain files for visual planning, demonstrating strong generalization across unseen instances, appearances, and game rules without requiring human-defined domain files or constant environment access.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) show strong potential for visual planning but
struggle with precise spatial and long-horizon reasoning. In contrast, Planning
Domain Definition Language (PDDL) planners excel at long-horizon formal
planning, but cannot interpret visual inputs. Recent works combine these
complementary advantages by enabling VLMs to turn visual planning problems into
PDDL files for formal planning. However, while VLMs can generate PDDL problem
files satisfactorily, they struggle to accurately generate the PDDL domain
files, which describe all the planning rules. As a result, prior methods rely
on human experts to predefine domain files or on constant environment access
for refinement. We propose VLMFP, a Dual-VLM-guided framework that can
autonomously generate both PDDL problem and domain files for formal visual
planning. VLMFP introduces two VLMs to ensure reliable PDDL file generation: A
SimVLM that simulates action consequences based on input rule descriptions, and
a GenVLM that generates and iteratively refines PDDL files by comparing the
PDDL and SimVLM execution results. VLMFP unleashes multiple levels of
generalizability: The same generated PDDL domain file works for all the
different instances under the same problem, and VLMs generalize to different
problems with varied appearances and rules. We evaluate VLMFP with 6 grid-world
domains and test its generalization to unseen instances, appearance, and game
rules. On average, SimVLM accurately describes 95.5%, 82.6% of scenarios,
simulates 85.5%, 87.8% of action sequence, and judges 82.4%, 85.6% goal
reaching for seen and unseen appearances, respectively. With the guidance of
SimVLM, VLMFP can generate PDDL files to reach 70.0%, 54.1% valid plans for
unseen instances in seen and unseen appearances, respectively. Project page:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BrowserArena is a live open-web evaluation platform that identifies three key failure modes in web agents: captcha resolution, pop-up banner removal, and direct URL navigation, revealing both diversity and brittleness in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current web agent evaluations are limited to sandboxed environments or artificial tasks, failing to capture real-world performance on the open web.

Method: BrowserArena platform collects user-submitted tasks, runs head-to-head comparisons, and uses step-level human feedback to analyze agent traces and identify failure modes.

Result: Identified three consistent failure modes across models, with o4-mini showing diverse captcha circumvention strategies while DeepSeek-R1 misleads users about captcha resolution.

Conclusion: Current web agents exhibit both diversity and brittleness, and the benchmarking methodology provides scalable approach to understanding web agent failure modes.

Abstract: LLM web agents now browse and take actions on the open web, yet current agent
evaluations are constrained to sandboxed environments or artificial tasks. We
introduce BrowserArena, a live open-web agent evaluation platform that collects
user-submitted tasks, runs Arena-style head-to-head comparisons, and uses
step-level human feedback to surface failure modes. Collecting and analyzing
step-level annotations on the agent traces, we identify three consistent
failure modes: captcha resolution, pop-up banner removal, and direct navigation
to URLs. By constructing targeted datasets to further study these tasks, we
discover variations in how different language models navigate these failure
modes. We find, for example, that o4-mini deploys a wider variety of strategies
to circumvent captcha resolution than other models and DeepSeek-R1 consistently
misleads users about captcha resolution. Our findings surface both the
diversity and brittleness of current web agents. More broadly, our benchmarking
methodology provides an approach to evaluating and understanding web agent
failure modes at scale.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies issues with ShotBench benchmark and ShotVL model for cinematography understanding, proposes RefineShot as a refined benchmark with improved evaluation reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address ambiguous option design in ShotBench and ShotVL's reasoning inconsistencies that undermine evaluation reliability and hinder fair comparison in cinematography understanding.

Method: Systematically refine ShotBench through consistent option restructuring, conduct critical analysis of ShotVL's reasoning behavior, and introduce extended evaluation protocol assessing both task accuracy and core model competencies.

Result: Development of RefineShot, a refined and expanded benchmark that enables more reliable assessment of cinematography understanding capabilities.

Conclusion: RefineShot addresses previous limitations and provides a more reliable foundation for evaluating and advancing cinematography understanding models.

Abstract: Cinematography understanding refers to the ability to recognize not only the
visual content of a scene but also the cinematic techniques that shape
narrative meaning. This capability is attracting increasing attention, as it
enhances multimodal understanding in real-world applications and underpins
coherent content creation in film and media. As the most comprehensive
benchmark for this task, ShotBench spans a wide range of cinematic concepts and
VQA-style evaluations, with ShotVL achieving state-of-the-art results on it.
However, our analysis reveals that ambiguous option design in ShotBench and
ShotVL's shortcomings in reasoning consistency and instruction adherence
undermine evaluation reliability, limiting fair comparison and hindering future
progress. To overcome these issues, we systematically refine ShotBench through
consistent option restructuring, conduct the first critical analysis of
ShotVL's reasoning behavior, and introduce an extended evaluation protocol that
jointly assesses task accuracy and core model competencies. These efforts lead
to RefineShot, a refined and expanded benchmark that enables more reliable
assessment and fosters future advances in cinematography understanding.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a safety mechanism using distribution-free risk control to limit performance degradation from harmful in-context demonstrations while maintaining computational efficiency gains with helpful inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address safety concerns where LLMs can be influenced by incorrect or malicious demonstrations, requiring built-in mechanisms to guard against such attacks.

Method: Define baseline safe behavior (zero-shot performance), apply distribution-free risk control with dynamic early exit prediction that ignores attention heads attending to unsafe inputs, and modify DFRC to handle both harmful and helpful inputs.

Result: The approach effectively controls risk for harmful in-context demonstrations while achieving substantial computational efficiency gains with helpful demonstrations.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a principled safety mechanism that protects against harmful demonstrations while maintaining performance benefits from helpful inputs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate a remarkable ability to learn new
tasks from a few in-context examples. However, this flexibility introduces
safety concerns: LLMs can be influenced by incorrect or malicious
demonstrations -- for example, if an adversary tampers with or injects harmful
examples without a human supervisor noticing. This motivates principled designs
in which the system itself includes built-in mechanisms to guard against such
attacks. We propose a novel approach to limit the degree to which harmful
demonstrations can degrade model performance. First, we define a baseline
``safe'' behavior for the model -- the model's performance given no in-context
demonstrations (zero-shot). Next, we apply distribution-free risk control
(DFRC) to control the extent to which in-context samples can decay performance
below zero-shot. We achieve this by leveraging dynamic early exit prediction,
ignoring later attention heads that attend the most to the unsafe inputs.
Finally, we propose modifications to DFRC that allow it to both control risk
for harmful inputs \textit{and} leverage performance and efficiency gains on
helpful inputs. We present both theoretical and empirical results showing that
our approach can effectively control risk for harmful in-context demonstrations
while simultaneously achieving substantial computational efficiency gains with
helpful demonstrations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies specific attention heads in OpenFlamingo-4B that encode spatial relations, extracts "function vectors" from them, and shows these vectors can be manipulated to improve relational reasoning and solve analogy problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal mechanisms behind LMMs' in-context learning abilities for relational tasks and make these mechanisms more transparent and controllable.

Method: Used causal mediation analysis to identify key attention heads, extracted multimodal function vectors from these heads, and fine-tuned these vectors while keeping LMM parameters frozen.

Result: The extracted function vectors improved zero-shot accuracy, outperformed in-context learning baselines when fine-tuned, and could be linearly combined to solve novel spatial analogy problems.

Conclusion: LMMs encode spatial relational knowledge in localized internal structures that can be systematically extracted and optimized, advancing understanding of model modularity and control over relational reasoning.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) demonstrate impressive in-context learning
abilities from limited multimodal demonstrations, yet the internal mechanisms
supporting such task learning remain opaque. Building on prior work of large
language models, we show that a small subset of attention heads in the
vision-language model OpenFlamingo-4B is responsible for transmitting
representations of spatial relations. The activations of these attention heads,
termed function vectors, can be extracted and manipulated to alter an LMM's
performance on relational tasks. First, using both synthetic and real image
datasets, we apply causal mediation analysis to identify attention heads that
strongly influence relational predictions, and extract multimodal function
vectors that improve zero-shot accuracy at inference time. We further
demonstrate that these multimodal function vectors can be fine-tuned with a
modest amount of training data, while keeping LMM parameters frozen, to
significantly outperform in-context learning baselines. Finally, we show that
relation-specific function vectors can be linearly combined to solve analogy
problems involving novel and untrained spatial relations, highlighting the
strong generalization ability of this approach. Our results show that LMMs
encode spatial relational knowledge within localized internal structures, which
can be systematically extracted and optimized, thereby advancing our
understanding of model modularity and enhancing control over relational
reasoning in LMMs.

Motivation: While AI has advanced in automating individual tasks, managing complex multi-agent workflows remains challenging, requiring systems that can orchestrate collaboration in dynamic human-AI teams.

Method: The paper formalizes workflow management as a Partially Observable Stochastic Game and proposes the Autonomous Manager Agent concept. It releases MA-Gym, an open-source simulation framework, and evaluates GPT-5-based Manager Agents across 20 workflows.

Result: Evaluation shows GPT-5-based Manager Agents struggle to jointly optimize for goal completion, constraint adherence, and workflow runtime, highlighting workflow management as a difficult open problem.

Conclusion: The paper identifies workflow management as a significant challenge and discusses organizational and ethical implications of autonomous management systems.

Abstract: While agentic AI has advanced in automating individual tasks, managing
complex multi-agent workflows remains a challenging problem. This paper
presents a research vision for autonomous agentic systems that orchestrate
collaboration within dynamic human-AI teams. We propose the Autonomous Manager
Agent as a core challenge: an agent that decomposes complex goals into task
graphs, allocates tasks to human and AI workers, monitors progress, adapts to
changing conditions, and maintains transparent stakeholder communication. We
formalize workflow management as a Partially Observable Stochastic Game and
identify four foundational challenges: (1) compositional reasoning for
hierarchical decomposition, (2) multi-objective optimization under shifting
preferences, (3) coordination and planning in ad hoc teams, and (4) governance
and compliance by design. To advance this agenda, we release MA-Gym, an
open-source simulation and evaluation framework for multi-agent workflow
orchestration. Evaluating GPT-5-based Manager Agents across 20 workflows, we
find they struggle to jointly optimize for goal completion, constraint
adherence, and workflow runtime - underscoring workflow management as a
difficult open problem. We conclude with organizational and ethical
implications of autonomous management systems.

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks five reinforcement learning algorithms (DQN, QR-DQN, A2C, PPO, TRPO) for container stowage planning with crane scheduling, revealing performance gaps as complexity increases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Container stowage planning is critical for maritime efficiency but traditionally relies on human expertise. While RL has been applied, there's a lack of systematic benchmark comparisons across different algorithms.

Method: Developed a Gym environment for container stowage planning with crane scheduling in both multi-agent and single-agent formulations, then evaluated five RL algorithms under multiple scenarios of varying complexity.

Result: Results showed distinct performance gaps with increasing complexity, highlighting the importance of algorithm choice and problem formulation for container stowage planning.

Conclusion: The paper provides benchmark comparisons of multiple RL methods for container stowage planning and offers a reusable Gym environment with crane scheduling as a foundation for future research and practical deployment.

Abstract: Container stowage planning (CSPP) is a critical component of maritime
transportation and terminal operations, directly affecting supply chain
efficiency. Owing to its complexity, CSPP has traditionally relied on human
expertise. While reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been applied to CSPP,
systematic benchmark comparisons across different algorithms remain limited. To
address this gap, we develop a Gym environment that captures the fundamental
features of CSPP and extend it to include crane scheduling in both multi-agent
and single-agent formulations. Within this framework, we evaluate five RL
algorithms: DQN, QR-DQN, A2C, PPO, and TRPO under multiple scenarios of varying
complexity. The results reveal distinct performance gaps with increasing
complexity, underscoring the importance of algorithm choice and problem
formulation for CSPP. Overall, this paper benchmarks multiple RL methods for
CSPP while providing a reusable Gym environment with crane scheduling, thus
offering a foundation for future research and practical deployment in maritime
logistics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-modal LLM framework processes sensor data to generate natural-language alerts for EV drivers, enhancing safety and decision-making in urban driving scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of ensuring safe and interpretable interactions between drivers, vehicles, and the environment in EV integration with smart grids.

Method: Combines visual perception (YOLOv8), geocoded positioning, and CAN bus telemetry using a multi-modal LLM framework to process sensor data and generate driver alerts.

Result: Validated with real-world data, the framework effectively generates context-aware alerts for critical situations like proximity to pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles.

Conclusion: LLMs show potential as assistive tools in e-mobility, benefiting transportation systems and electric networks through scalable fleet coordination, EV load forecasting, and traffic-aware energy planning.

Abstract: The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into smart grids presents unique
opportunities to enhance both transportation systems and energy networks.
However, ensuring safe and interpretable interactions between drivers,
vehicles, and the surrounding environment remains a critical challenge. This
paper presents a multi-modal large language model (LLM)-based framework to
process multimodal sensor data - such as object detection, semantic
segmentation, and vehicular telemetry - and generate natural-language alerts
for drivers. The framework is validated using real-world data collected from
instrumented vehicles driving on urban roads, ensuring its applicability to
real-world scenarios. By combining visual perception (YOLOv8), geocoded
positioning, and CAN bus telemetry, the framework bridges raw sensor data and
driver comprehension, enabling safer and more informed decision-making in urban
driving scenarios. Case studies using real data demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in generating context-aware alerts for critical situations, such
as proximity to pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles. This paper
highlights the potential of LLMs as assistive tools in e-mobility, benefiting
both transportation systems and electric networks by enabling scalable fleet
coordination, EV load forecasting, and traffic-aware energy planning.

### [100] [Mitigating Modal Imbalance in Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02608)
*Chen Henry Wu,Neil Kale,Aditi Raghunathan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Foundation models struggle with cross-modal reasoning, showing only 3% conflict recognition when evidence is split across modalities due to attention imbalance, but simple training improvements can fix this.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how well foundation models perform joint reasoning across multiple modalities, especially when modalities interact and form cross-modal contexts with conflicting evidence.

Method: Study cross-modal conflicts where conflicting evidence is presented across modalities, analyze attention imbalance, and test simple training methods that explicitly combine multiple modalities within each training instance.

Result: FMs recognize conflicts 90% in unimodal contexts but only 3% when evidence is split across modalities. Cross-modal attention imbalance is the cause, but simple training improvements reduce imbalance and improve downstream performance.

Conclusion: Systematically addressing cross-modal contexts is crucial for building reliable foundation models, and attention imbalance can be mitigated through explicit cross-modal training.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) deployed in real-world tasks such as computer-use
agents must integrate diverse modalities. How good are FMs at performing joint
reasoning, simultaneously reasoning over multiple modalities, especially when
the modalities interact and relate to each other to form cross-modal context?
To better understand this problem, we study FMs on cross-modal conflicts:
scenarios where conflicting evidence is presented across modalities. This
allows us to examine whether FMs prioritize one modality over another or reason
jointly to reconcile the conflict. Our experiments reveal that FMs can
recognize conflicts in unimodal contexts, composed of a single modality, 90% of
the time, but the ratio falls as low as 3% when evidence is split across
modalities -- similar observations hold in cross-lingual contexts, composed of
multiple languages. We trace this failure to cross-modal attention imbalance,
showing that FMs exhibit extreme asymmetry in attention scores,
disproportionately prioritizing certain modalities. We show that cross-modal
attention imbalance does not go away by simply scaling up multimodal or
multilingual datasets blindly, since they lack training examples that
explicitly require cross-modal reasoning. We demonstrate that even a simple and
scalable method of explicitly combining multiple modalities within each
training instance significantly reduces attention imbalance. Reduced attention
imbalance directly translates to improved downstream performance on several
vision-language benchmarks. Our findings underscore the importance of
systematically addressing cross-modal contexts to build reliable foundation
models.

### [101] [On the Role of Temperature Sampling in Test-Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02611)
*Yuheng Wu,Azalia Mirhoseini,Thierry Tambe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Test-time scaling with multiple samples reaches a performance plateau at large K, but scaling across different temperatures can further improve reasoning by solving different subsets of problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work showed that increasing the number of reasoning samples (K) steadily improves accuracy, but this trend doesn't hold indefinitely - hard questions remain unsolved regardless of K, and single-temperature scaling only explores part of a model's potential.

Method: Proposed temperature scaling where multiple reasoning traces are generated at different sampling temperatures, and designed a multi-temperature voting method to reduce overhead.

Result: Temperature scaling yields an additional 7.3 points over single-temperature TTS across Qwen3 models and five reasoning benchmarks, enabling base models to reach performance comparable to RL-trained counterparts without additional post-training.

Conclusion: Test-time scaling is more powerful than previously thought, and temperature scaling offers a simple and effective way to unlock the latent potential of base models by exploring different reasoning paths across temperature dimensions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can improve reasoning at inference time through
test-time scaling (TTS), where multiple reasoning traces are generated and the
best one is selected. Prior work shows that increasing the number of samples K
steadily improves accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that this trend does
not hold indefinitely: at large K, further scaling yields no gains, and certain
hard questions remain unsolved regardless of the number of traces.
Interestingly, we find that different sampling temperatures solve different
subsets of problems, implying that single-temperature scaling explores only
part of a model's potential. We therefore propose scaling along the temperature
dimension, which enlarges the reasoning boundary of LLMs. Averaged over Qwen3
(0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B) and five representative reasoning benchmarks (AIME
2024/2025, MATH500, LiveCodeBench, Hi-ToM), temperature scaling yields an
additional 7.3 points over single-temperature TTS. Temperature scaling also
enables base models to reach performance comparable to reinforcement learning
(RL)-trained counterparts, without additional post-training. We further provide
a comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon and design a multi-temperature
voting method that reduces the overhead of temperature scaling. Overall, our
findings suggest that TTS is more powerful than previously thought, and that
temperature scaling offers a simple and effective way to unlock the latent
potential of base models.

### [103] [A Concept of Possibility for Real-World Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02655)
*Daniel G. Schwartz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new concept of possibility as an alternative to Zadeh's standard possibility theory, focusing specifically on real-world events and their feasibility for planning purposes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an alternative to Zadeh's possibility theory that specifically addresses the possibility of real-world events, particularly for planning applications where multiple plans need evaluation.

Method: Defines possibility as a function of probabilities that prerequisites hold and constraints do not hold, using Łukasiewicz multivalent interpretation of logical connectives.

Result: Developed a theory that can determine which plan is most possible (easiest or most feasible) when multiple plans are available for achieving a goal.

Conclusion: The new possibility concept may correctly capture normal human reasoning about plans and has potential applications in planning problems, as demonstrated through vehicle route planning examples.

Abstract: This paper offers a new concept of {\it possibility} as an alternative to the
now-a-days standard concept originally introduced by L.A. Zadeh in 1978. This
new version was inspired by the original but, formally, has nothing in common
with it other than that they both adopt the {\L}ukasiewicz multivalent
interpretation of the logical connectives. Moreover, rather than seeking to
provide a general notion of possibility, this focuses specifically on the
possibility of a real-world event. An event is viewed as having prerequisites
that enable its occurrence and constraints that may impede its occurrence, and
the possibility of the event is computed as a function of the probabilities
that the prerequisites hold and the constraints do not. This version of
possibility might appropriately be applied to problems of planning. When there
are multiple plans available for achieving a goal, this theory can be used to
determine which plan is most possible, i.e., easiest or most feasible to
complete. It is speculated that this model of reasoning correctly captures
normal human reasoning about plans. The theory is elaborated and an
illustrative example for vehicle route planning is provided. There is also a
suggestion of potential future applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoMaAS is a self-evolving multi-agent architecture search framework that automatically discovers optimal agent configurations using neural architecture search principles, achieving performance improvements of 1.0-7.1% while reducing inference costs by 3-5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated design approaches for multi-agent systems fail to adapt resource allocation based on query complexity and domain requirements, seeking monolithic solutions that are inefficient.

Result: Extensive experiments across six benchmarks show AutoMaAS achieves 1.0-7.1% performance improvement while reducing inference costs by 3-5% compared to state-of-the-art methods, with superior transferability across datasets and LLM backbones.

Conclusion: AutoMaAS establishes a new paradigm for automated multi-agent system design in the era of large language models through its self-evolving architecture search framework.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by large language models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, yet existing automated design
approaches seek monolithic solutions that fail to adapt resource allocation
based on query complexity and domain requirements. This paper introduces
AutoMaAS, a self-evolving multi-agent architecture search framework that
leverages neural architecture search principles to automatically discover

on performance-cost analysis, (2) dynamic cost-aware optimization with
real-time parameter adjustment, (3) online feedback integration for continuous
architecture refinement, and (4) enhanced interpretability through decision
tracing mechanisms. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate
that AutoMaAS achieves 1.0-7.1\% performance improvement while reducing
inference costs by 3-5\% compared to state-of-the-art methods. The framework
shows superior transferability across datasets and LLM backbones, establishing
a new paradigm for automated multi-agent system design in the era of large

### [105] [ARMs: Adaptive Red-Teaming Agent against Multimodal Models with Plug-and-Play Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02677)
*Zhaorun Chen,Xun Liu,Mintong Kang,Jiawei Zhang,Minzhou Pan,Shuang Yang,Bo Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARMs is an adaptive red-teaming agent that systematically assesses safety vulnerabilities in vision-language models (VLMs) by automatically optimizing diverse attack strategies to elicit harmful outputs, achieving state-of-the-art attack success rates while generating a large-scale safety dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing red-teaming approaches for VLMs are limited to narrow adversarial patterns or require manual engineering, lacking scalable exploration of emerging real-world vulnerabilities in multimodal interfaces.

Method: ARMs uses reasoning-enhanced multi-step orchestration to optimize red-teaming strategies, incorporates 11 novel multimodal attack strategies covering diverse adversarial patterns, integrates 17 red-teaming algorithms via model context protocol, and employs layered memory with epsilon-greedy attack exploration for balanced diversity and effectiveness.

Result: ARMs achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates, exceeding baselines by 52.1% on average and surpassing 90% on Claude-4-Sonnet. It generates significantly more diverse red-teaming instances and constructs ARMs-Bench, a large-scale dataset with 30K+ instances across 51 risk categories.

Conclusion: Safety fine-tuning with ARMs-Bench substantially improves VLM robustness while preserving utility, providing actionable guidance for multimodal safety alignment against emerging threats.

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) gain prominence, their multimodal interfaces
also introduce new safety vulnerabilities, making the safety evaluation
challenging and critical. Existing red-teaming efforts are either restricted to
a narrow set of adversarial patterns or depend heavily on manual engineering,
lacking scalable exploration of emerging real-world VLM vulnerabilities. To
bridge this gap, we propose ARMs, an adaptive red-teaming agent that
systematically conducts comprehensive risk assessments for VLMs. Given a target
harmful behavior or risk definition, ARMs automatically optimizes diverse
red-teaming strategies with reasoning-enhanced multi-step orchestration, to
effectively elicit harmful outputs from target VLMs. We propose 11 novel
multimodal attack strategies, covering diverse adversarial patterns of VLMs
(e.g., reasoning hijacking, contextual cloaking), and integrate 17 red-teaming
algorithms into ARMs via model context protocol (MCP). To balance the diversity
and effectiveness of the attack, we design a layered memory with an
epsilon-greedy attack exploration algorithm. Extensive experiments on instance-
and policy-based benchmarks show that ARMs achieves SOTA attack success rates,
exceeding baselines by an average of 52.1% and surpassing 90% on
Claude-4-Sonnet. We show that the diversity of red-teaming instances generated
by ARMs is significantly higher, revealing emerging vulnerabilities in VLMs.
Leveraging ARMs, we construct ARMs-Bench, a large-scale multimodal safety
dataset comprising over 30K red-teaming instances spanning 51 diverse risk
categories, grounded in both real-world multimodal threats and regulatory
risks. Safety fine-tuning with ARMs-Bench substantially improves the robustness
of VLMs while preserving their general utility, providing actionable guidance
to improve multimodal safety alignment against emerging threats.

*Yu-Zhe Shi,Qiao Xu,Yanjia Li,Mingchen Liu,Huamin Qu,Lecheng Ruan,Qining Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a constraint-centric architecture that regulates LLMs for automated constraint specification in production scheduling, addressing challenges of natural language ambiguity and non-deterministic outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current APS systems require manual and labor-intensive constraint specification from manufacturing data, while direct LLM application faces challenges due to ambiguity and limited domain knowledge.

Method: A hierarchical constraint-centric architecture organized across three levels with domain-specific representation, plus an automated production scenario adaptation algorithm for customization.

Result: The approach successfully balances LLM generative capabilities with manufacturing reliability requirements, significantly outperforming pure LLM-based methods in constraint specification.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture enables reliable automated constraint specification for production scheduling by regulating LLMs through structured domain-specific frameworks.

Abstract: Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) systems have become indispensable for
modern manufacturing operations, enabling optimized resource allocation and
production efficiency in increasingly complex and dynamic environments. While
algorithms for solving abstracted scheduling problems have been extensively
investigated, the critical prerequisite of specifying manufacturing
requirements into formal constraints remains manual and labor-intensive.
Although recent advances of generative models, particularly Large Language
Models (LLMs), show promise in automating constraint specification from
heterogeneous raw manufacturing data, their direct application faces challenges
due to natural language ambiguity, non-deterministic outputs, and limited
domain-specific knowledge. This paper presents a constraint-centric
architecture that regulates LLMs to perform reliable automated constraint
specification for production scheduling. The architecture defines a
hierarchical structural space organized across three levels, implemented
through domain-specific representation to ensure precision and reliability
while maintaining flexibility. Furthermore, an automated production scenario
adaptation algorithm is designed and deployed to efficiently customize the
architecture for specific manufacturing configurations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully balances the generative
capabilities of LLMs with the reliability requirements of manufacturing
systems, significantly outperforming pure LLM-based approaches in constraint
specification tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Node-wise Consistency Verification (NCV) is a training-free framework that improves LLM reasoning verification by decomposing reasoning chains into nodes and performing lightweight binary consistency checks, achieving better performance with significantly fewer tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for verifying multi-step reasoning in LLMs suffer from imprecise error localization, high token costs, attention dilution, and expensive multi-sampling requirements.

Method: NCV recasts verification as lightweight binary consistency checks at the node level by decomposing the chain of thought into interconnected verification nodes, avoiding unnecessary long-form generation.

Result: NCV achieves 10% to 25% improvement in F1 scores over baselines while using 6× to 58× fewer tokens than traditional CoT-based verifiers on public datasets.

Conclusion: NCV provides a scalable solution for reliable LLM reasoning verification that enhances both interpretability and efficiency through precise error localization and reduced token usage.

Abstract: Verifying multi-step reasoning in large language models is difficult due to
imprecise error localization and high token costs. Existing methods either
assess entire reasoning chains, suffering attention dilution, or rely on
expensive multi-sampling. We introduce Node-wise Consistency Verification
(NCV), a training-free framework that recasts verification as lightweight
binary consistency checks at the node level. By decomposing the chain of
thought into interconnected verification nodes, NCV precisely localizes errors
and avoids unnecessary long-form generation. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach enhances interpretability and efficiency, presenting a scalable
solution for reliable LLM reasoning verification. On public datasets, NCV
achieves a 10\% to 25\% improvement in F1 scores over baselines while utilizing
$6\times$~$58\times$ fewer tokens than traditional methods like CoT-based
verifiers.

### [108] [Beyond the Final Answer: Evaluating the Reasoning Trajectories of Tool-Augmented Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02837)
*Wonjoong Kim,Sangwu Park,Yeonjun In,Sein Kim,Dongha Lee,Chanyoung Park*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TRACE is a framework for multi-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agents that assesses problem-solving trajectories beyond just final answers, focusing on efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity using an evidence bank approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tool-augmented benchmarks only evaluate final answers through answer matching, ignoring important aspects like efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity in problem-solving trajectories. Ground-truth trajectory annotation is too expensive, and simple LLM evaluators can't assess trajectories without ground truth.

Method: TRACE incorporates an evidence bank that accumulates knowledge from preceding reasoning steps to enable multi-faceted analysis of agent reasoning trajectories. The framework was validated using a meta-evaluation dataset created by augmenting existing benchmarks with diverse and flawed trajectories labeled with multi-faceted performance scores.

Result: TRACE accurately evaluates complex agent behaviors in a scalable and cost-effective manner, even with small open-source LLMs. The method successfully identified previously unreported observations and insights from agent trajectories in tool-augmented tasks.

Conclusion: TRACE provides an effective solution for comprehensive evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agents by enabling detailed trajectory assessment without requiring expensive ground-truth annotations, offering new insights into agent performance beyond simple answer matching.

Abstract: Although recent tool-augmented benchmarks incorporate complex user requests
and diverse tools, the evaluation methods for most of them remain limited to
answer matching. However, as the number of steps required to resolve a user
request increases, a proper evaluation of an agent's performance must go beyond
the final answer to also assess the problem-solving trajectory, including
previously ignored aspects such as efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity.
The most straightforward method for evaluating these aspects is to compare an
agent's trajectory with the ground-truth trajectory, but this approach is
fundamentally limited since annotating all valid ground-truth trajectories is
prohibitively expensive. However, a simple LLM-based evaluator struggles to
assess trajectories in detail without ground truth. To effectively evaluate the
agents in this manner, we introduce TRACE, a framework for the
multi-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agent performance. By
incorporating an evidence bank, which accumulates knowledge gathered from
preceding reasoning steps, TRACE enables a multi-faceted analysis and
evaluation of an agent's reasoning trajectory effectively. To validate our
framework, we develop a new meta-evaluation dataset by augmenting existing
benchmarks with diverse and flawed trajectories, each labeled with
multi-faceted performance scores. Our results confirm that TRACE accurately
evaluates these complex behaviors in a scalable and cost-effective manner, even
with small open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we apply our method to evaluate the
trajectories that agents produce while solving tool-augmented tasks, presenting
previously unreported observations and their corresponding insights.

*Antoine Maier,Aude Maier,Tom David*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper challenges the Objective Satisfaction Assumption (OSA) in machine learning, arguing that training never perfectly achieves specified objectives due to approximation, estimation, and optimization errors, combined with inevitable objective misspecification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the rarely questioned assumption that machine learning models actually satisfy their specified objective functions, and to highlight the implications when this assumption fails in realistic conditions.

Method: The authors use a learning-paradigm-agnostic framework to analyze how approximation, estimation, and optimization errors systematically prevent objective satisfaction, and build on recent mathematical results to show these gaps are indistinguishable from Goodhart's law failure modes.

Result: The analysis reveals that continued optimization of General-Purpose AI systems without principled limits is liable to push systems into predictable and irreversible loss of control, as the breaking point cannot be determined beforehand.

Conclusion: A principled limit on the optimization of General-Purpose AI systems is necessary to prevent predictable loss of control, since perfect objective satisfaction is impossible and Goodhart's law failure modes cannot be avoided ex ante.

Abstract: A common but rarely examined assumption in machine learning is that training
yields models that actually satisfy their specified objective function. We call
this the Objective Satisfaction Assumption (OSA). Although deviations from OSA
are acknowledged, their implications are overlooked. We argue, in a
learning-paradigm-agnostic framework, that OSA fails in realistic conditions:
approximation, estimation, and optimization errors guarantee systematic
deviations from the intended objective, regardless of the quality of its
specification. Beyond these technical limitations, perfectly capturing and
translating the developer's intent, such as alignment with human preferences,
into a formal objective is practically impossible, making misspecification
inevitable. Building on recent mathematical results, absent a mathematical
characterization of these gaps, they are indistinguishable from those that
collapse into Goodhart's law failure modes under strong optimization pressure.
Because the Goodhart breaking point cannot be located ex ante, a principled
limit on the optimization of General-Purpose AI systems is necessary. Absent
such a limit, continued optimization is liable to push systems into predictable
and irreversible loss of control.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BayesianRouter is a hybrid framework for reward model routing that combines offline learning of RM strengths with online Bayesian selection, outperforming existing methods on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLHF/RLAIF pipelines rely on single reward models, limiting alignment quality and risking overfitting. Existing RM routing methods suffer from cold-start and insufficient exploration issues.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Offline training of multi-task router on preference data to estimate per-RM reliability, 2) Online Bayesian Thompson sampling router that performs per-query RM selection using Gaussian priors from offline embeddings and adaptively updates posteriors with online rewards.

Result: Extensive experiments on instruction-following (AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, MT-Bench) and reasoning (GSM8K, MMLU) benchmarks show BayesianRouter consistently outperforms individual RMs, RM ensembling, and existing routing methods.

Conclusion: BayesianRouter effectively addresses cold-start and exploration issues in RM routing, providing a robust framework for dynamic RM selection that leverages complementary strengths while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human or AI feedback (RLHF / RLAIF) has become
the standard paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, most
pipelines rely on a single reward model (RM), limiting alignment quality and
risking overfitting. Recent work explores RM routing--dynamically selecting an
RM from a candidate pool to exploit complementary strengths while maintaining
$O(1)$ RM calls--but existing methods suffer from cold-start and insufficient
exploration. We propose BayesianRouter, a hybrid routing framework that
combines offline RM strengths learning with online Bayesian selection. In the
offline stage, a multi-task router is trained on preference data to estimate
per-RM reliability. In the online stage, a Bayesian Thompson sampling router
performs per-query RM selection, initializing RM-specific weight vectors with
offline embeddings as Gaussian priors and adaptively updating their posteriors
with online rewards to adapt to the evolving policy distribution. Extensive
experiments on instruction-following (AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, MT-Bench) and
reasoning (GSM8K, MMLU) benchmarks show that BayesianRouter consistently
outperforms individual RMs, RM ensembling, and existing routing methods.

TL;DR: MaskGRPO is the first viable approach for scalable multimodal reinforcement learning in discrete diffusion models, addressing challenges with importance sampling and rollout complexity through theoretical foundations and modality-specific adaptations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing discrete diffusion models with rewards is challenging due to the non-autoregressive paradigm making importance sampling intractable and rollout complex, which puzzles reinforcement learning methods like GRPO.

Method: Developed theoretical foundation for DDMs to build an importance estimator capturing token fluctuation for gradient updates, and tailored rollout method for visual sequences to yield diverse completions and reliable optimization gradients.

Result: MaskGRPO brings more stable and efficient updates across math reasoning, coding, and visual generation benchmarks, leading to stronger reasoning performance and better generation quality.

Conclusion: MaskGRPO establishes itself as a systematic policy optimization approach and the first practical way for discretized visual diffusion.

Abstract: Optimizing discrete diffusion model (DDM) with rewards remains a challenge:
the non-autoregressive paradigm makes importance sampling intractable and
rollout complex, puzzling reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this study, we introduce MaskGRPO, the first
viable approach to enable scalable multimodal reinforcement learning in
discrete diffusion with effective importance sampling and modality-specific
adaptations. To this end, we first clarify the theoretical foundation for DDMs,
which facilitates building an importance estimator that captures valuable token
fluctuation for gradient updates. We then delicately tailored the rollout
method for visual sequences, which yields diverse completions and reliable
optimization gradients. Upon math reasoning, coding, and visual generation
benchmarks, MaskGRPO brings more stable and efficient updates, leading to
stronger reasoning performance and better generation quality. This study
establishes MaskGRPO as a systematic policy optimization approach and the first
practical way for discretized visual diffusion.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods are black-box systems that lack explanations, limiting their trustworthiness. XAI methods are developed with technical assumptions about explanations, but the concept of explanation itself is philosophically complex and debated.

Method: The authors investigate ontological and epistemological assumptions in XAI methods - examining what assumptions are made about the existence of explanations and our ability to know them. They analyze how technical changes in XAI methods correspond to different philosophical positions.

Result: The analysis reveals that seemingly minor technical modifications in XAI methods can represent significant differences in underlying philosophical assumptions about explanations. Different XAI methods embody different onto-epistemological paradigms.

Conclusion: Ignoring the underlying philosophical paradigm when selecting XAI methods poses risks. The paper emphasizes the importance of carefully choosing and adapting XAI methods based on their philosophical foundations to ensure appropriate application across different domains.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is being applied in almost every field. At the
same time, the currently dominant deep learning methods are fundamentally
black-box systems that lack explanations for their inferences, significantly
limiting their trustworthiness and adoption. Explainable AI (XAI) methods aim
to overcome this challenge by providing explanations of the models' decision
process. Such methods are often proposed and developed by engineers and
scientists with a predominantly technical background and incorporate their
assumptions about the existence, validity, and explanatory utility of different
conceivable explanatory mechanisms. However, the basic concept of an
explanation -- what it is, whether we can know it, whether it is absolute or
relative -- is far from trivial and has been the subject of deep philosophical
debate for millennia. As we point out here, the assumptions incorporated into
different XAI methods are not harmless and have important consequences for the
validity and interpretation of AI explanations in different domains. We
investigate ontological and epistemological assumptions in explainability
methods when they are applied to AI systems, meaning the assumptions we make
about the existence of explanations and our ability to gain knowledge about
those explanations. Our analysis shows how seemingly small technical changes to
an XAI method may correspond to important differences in the underlying
assumptions about explanations. We furthermore highlight the risks of ignoring
the underlying onto-epistemological paradigm when choosing an XAI method for a
given application, and we discuss how to select and adapt appropriate XAI
methods for different domains of application.

### [113] [From Facts to Foils: Designing and Evaluating Counterfactual Explanations for Smart Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03078)
*Anna Trapp,Mersedeh Sadeghi,Andreas Vogelsang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: First formalization and implementation of counterfactual explanations for rule-based smart environments, showing user preference depends on context - causal explanations for simplicity/time pressure, counterfactuals for actionable problem-solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Counterfactual explanations are powerful in XAI but no established methods exist for generating them in rule-based smart environments, despite explainability being essential in this domain.

Method: Developed a formalization and implementation of counterfactual explanations as a plugin extending an existing explanation engine for smart environments, then conducted user study (N=17) comparing counterfactuals against traditional causal explanations.

Result: User preference is highly contextual - causal explanations favored for linguistic simplicity and time-pressured situations, while counterfactuals preferred for actionable content when users want to resolve problems.

Conclusion: Provides practical framework for counterfactual explanations in smart environments and empirical evidence guiding when each explanation type is most effective.

Abstract: Explainability is increasingly seen as an essential feature of rule-based
smart environments. While counterfactual explanations, which describe what
could have been done differently to achieve a desired outcome, are a powerful
tool in eXplainable AI (XAI), no established methods exist for generating them
in these rule-based domains. In this paper, we present the first formalization
and implementation of counterfactual explanations tailored to this domain. It
is implemented as a plugin that extends an existing explanation engine for
smart environments. We conducted a user study (N=17) to evaluate our generated
counterfactuals against traditional causal explanations. The results show that
user preference is highly contextual: causal explanations are favored for their
linguistic simplicity and in time-pressured situations, while counterfactuals
are preferred for their actionable content, particularly when a user wants to
resolve a problem. Our work contributes a practical framework for a new type of
explanation in smart environments and provides empirical evidence to guide the
choice of when each explanation type is most effective.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study evaluates AI models' abstract reasoning by testing generalization on Raven's Progressive Matrices with deliberately omitted rules during training, revealing limitations in current approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether AI systems' performance on RPM tasks reflects genuine reasoning ability or reliance on statistical shortcuts, particularly under conditions of incomplete training.

Method: Evaluated sequence-to-sequence transformers and vision-based architectures (CoPINet, Dual-Contrast Network) on I-RAVEN dataset with deliberately omitted structural rules during training.

Result: Transformers showed strong performance on familiar rules but sharp accuracy decline on novel/omitted rules; gap between token-level and complete answer accuracy revealed fundamental limitations.

Conclusion: Current AI approaches have limitations in robust abstract reasoning, highlighting the need for architectures that move beyond pattern recognition to genuine reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Analogical reasoning lies at the core of human cognition and remains a
fundamental challenge for artificial intelligence. Raven's Progressive Matrices
(RPM) serve as a widely used benchmark to assess abstract reasoning by
requiring the inference of underlying structural rules. While many vision-based
and language-based models have achieved success on RPM tasks, it remains
unclear whether their performance reflects genuine reasoning ability or
reliance on statistical shortcuts. This study investigates the generalization
capacity of modern AI systems under conditions of incomplete training by
deliberately omitting several structural rules during training. Both
sequence-to-sequence transformer models and vision-based architectures such as
CoPINet and the Dual-Contrast Network are evaluated on the Impartial-RAVEN
(I-RAVEN) dataset. Experiments reveal that although transformers demonstrate
strong performance on familiar rules, their accuracy declines sharply when
faced with novel or omitted rules. Moreover, the gap between token-level
accuracy and complete answer accuracy highlights fundamental limitations in
current approaches. These findings provide new insights into the reasoning
mechanisms underlying deep learning models and underscore the need for
architectures that move beyond pattern recognition toward robust abstract
reasoning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance collaborative reasoning and cooperation in multiagent systems by leveraging LLMs and exploring effective prompting methods for better agent collaboration and decision-making.

Method: Enhanced the CoELA framework with different LLMs and prompt engineering strategies, conducted systematic experimentation to identify optimal combinations, and integrated speech capabilities for voice-based interactions.

Result: The best prompt combination improved system efficiency by 22% with Gemma3 compared to original CoELA, and speech integration provided a more engaging user interface.

Conclusion: Prompt optimization significantly enhances collaborative agent performance, and speech integration offers practical benefits for system development and demonstrations.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into multiagent systems has
opened new possibilities for collaborative reasoning and cooperation with AI
agents. This paper explores different prompting methods and evaluates their
effectiveness in enhancing agent collaborative behaviour and decision-making.
We enhance CoELA, a framework designed for building Collaborative Embodied
Agents that leverage LLMs for multi-agent communication, reasoning, and task
coordination in shared virtual spaces. Through systematic experimentation, we
examine different LLMs and prompt engineering strategies to identify optimised
combinations that maximise collaboration performance. Furthermore, we extend
our research by integrating speech capabilities, enabling seamless
collaborative voice-based interactions. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of prompt optimisation in enhancing collaborative agent
performance; for example, our best combination improved the efficiency of the
system running with Gemma3 by 22% compared to the original CoELA system. In
addition, the speech integration provides a more engaging user interface for
iterative system development and demonstrations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoDA is a multi-agent system that automates data visualization from natural language queries by using specialized LLM agents for metadata analysis, task planning, code generation, and self-reflection, achieving 41.5% improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visualization automation systems struggle with complex multi-file datasets and iterative refinement, often oversimplifying the task and failing to handle data complexity, code errors, or visualization quality effectively.

Method: Reframes visualization automation as a collaborative multi-agent problem using specialized LLM agents: metadata analysis agent to bypass token limits, task planning agent, code generation agent, and self-reflection agent for quality-driven refinement.

Result: Extensive evaluations show CoDA achieves substantial gains in overall score, outperforming competitive baselines by up to 41.5%.

Conclusion: The future of visualization automation lies in integrated, collaborative agentic workflows rather than isolated code generation.

Abstract: Deep research has revolutionized data analysis, yet data scientists still
devote substantial time to manually crafting visualizations, highlighting the
need for robust automation from natural language queries. However, current
systems struggle with complex datasets containing multiple files and iterative
refinement. Existing approaches, including simple single- or multi-agent
systems, often oversimplify the task, focusing on initial query parsing while
failing to robustly manage data complexity, code errors, or final visualization
quality. In this paper, we reframe this challenge as a collaborative
multi-agent problem. We introduce CoDA, a multi-agent system that employs
specialized LLM agents for metadata analysis, task planning, code generation,
and self-reflection. We formalize this pipeline, demonstrating how
metadata-focused analysis bypasses token limits and quality-driven refinement
ensures robustness. Extensive evaluations show CoDA achieves substantial gains
in the overall score, outperforming competitive baselines by up to 41.5%. This
work demonstrates that the future of visualization automation lies not in
isolated code generation but in integrated, collaborative agentic workflows.

### [117] [Coevolutionary Continuous Discrete Diffusion: Make Your Diffusion Language Model a Latent Reasoner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03206)
*Cai Zhou,Chenxiao Yang,Yi Hu,Chenyu Wang,Chubin Zhang,Muhan Zhang,Lester Mackey,Tommi Jaakkola,Stephen Bates,Dinghuai Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes CCDD, a joint continuous-discrete diffusion model that combines the expressiveness of continuous diffusion with the trainability of discrete diffusion for improved language modeling performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuous diffusion models theoretically have stronger expressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers, but underperform in practice due to difficulties in decoding continuous representations back to discrete token space.

Method: Proposes Coevolutionary Continuous Discrete Diffusion (CCDD) - a joint multimodal diffusion process that simultaneously denoises in both continuous representation space and discrete token space using a single model.

Result: CCDD achieves strong empirical performance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks, combining rich semantics in latent space with good trainability and sample quality.

Conclusion: The joint continuous-discrete approach provides both expressiveness and practical trainability, addressing the gap between theoretical advantages and empirical performance of continuous diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion language models, especially masked discrete diffusion models, have
achieved great success recently. While there are some theoretical and primary
empirical results showing the advantages of latent reasoning with looped
transformers or continuous chain-of-thoughts, continuous diffusion models
typically underperform their discrete counterparts. In this paper, we argue
that diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete
space. In particular, we prove that continuous diffusion models have stronger
expressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers. We attribute the
contradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance
to their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides
intermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce
additional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the
continuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous
Discrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process
on the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space,
leveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By
combining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent
space, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of
explicit discrete tokens. We also propose effective architectures and advanced
training/sampling techniques for CCDD, which reveals strong empirical
performance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks.
