*Khartik Uppalapati,Bora Yimenicioglu,Shakeel Abdulkareem,Adan Eftekhari,Bhavya Uppalapati,Viraj Kamath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TinyViT-Batten is a few-shot Vision Transformer framework that detects early Batten disease from pediatric brain MRI with high accuracy (91%) using only limited training cases, outperforming traditional models while providing explainable predictions through Grad-CAM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of Batten disease is challenging because early MRI signs are subtle and often missed, and the disease is rare with limited training data available.

Method: Distilled a large teacher ViT into a 5M-parameter TinyViT and fine-tuned it using metric-based few-shot learning with prototypical loss and 5-shot episodes, integrated with Grad-CAM for explainable predictions.

Result: Achieved 91% accuracy and AUC ≥0.95 on multi-site dataset of 79 Batten disease MRIs and 90 controls, with sensitivity >90% and specificity ~90%, outperforming 3D-ResNet and Swin-Tiny baselines.

Conclusion: The model demonstrates a practical AI solution for early Batten disease detection with strong performance and explainable predictions, suitable for clinical deployment due to its small size.

Abstract: Batten disease (neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis) is a rare pediatric
neurodegenerative disorder whose early MRI signs are subtle and often missed.
We propose TinyViT-Batten, a few-shot Vision Transformer (ViT) framework to
detect early Batten disease from pediatric brain MRI with limited training
cases. We distill a large teacher ViT into a 5 M-parameter TinyViT and
fine-tune it using metric-based few-shot learning (prototypical loss with
5-shot episodes). Our model achieves high accuracy (approximately 91%) and area
under ROC of at least 0.95 on a multi-site dataset of 79 genetically confirmed
Batten-disease MRIs (27 CLN3 from the Hochstein natural-history study, 32 CLN2
from an international longitudinal cohort, 12 early-manifestation CLN2 cases
reported by Cokal et al., and 8 public Radiopaedia scans) together with 90
age-matched controls, outperforming a 3D-ResNet and Swin-Tiny baseline. We
further integrate Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to
highlight disease-relevant brain regions, enabling explainable predictions. The
model's small size and strong performance (sensitivity greater than 90%,
specificity approximately 90%) demonstrates a practical AI solution for early
Batten disease detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper provides a comprehensive review of the YOLO object detection family, tracing the evolution from YOLOv5 to the latest YOLO26, with detailed benchmarking on COCO dataset and discussions on deployment strategies and future challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically document the architectural evolution of YOLO detectors, provide quantitative performance comparisons across versions, and identify deployment considerations and future research directions for the YOLO family.

Method: The review analyzes key innovations in each YOLO version (YOLOv5, YOLOv8, YOLO11, YOLO26), benchmarks them on MS COCO dataset using metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, mAP, and inference speed, and compares with other detectors like YOLOv12, YOLOv13, RT-DETR, and DEIM.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the Ultralytics YOLO(You Only
Look Once) family of object detectors, focusing the architectural evolution,
benchmarking, deployment perspectives, and future challenges. The review begins
with the most recent release, YOLO26 (YOLOv26), which introduces key
innovations including Distribution Focal Loss (DFL) removal, native NMS-free
inference, Progressive Loss Balancing (ProgLoss), Small-Target-Aware Label
Assignment (STAL), and the MuSGD optimizer for stable training. The progression

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TreeNet is a novel layered decision ensemble learning method that combines neural networks, ensemble learning, and tree-based models for medical image analysis, achieving F1-scores up to 0.85 with full training data and 0.77 with 50% data, while maintaining real-time performance at 32 FPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of limited data availability and data confidence in medical image analysis, where existing methods like Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and Ensemble Learning show good accuracy but struggle with data scarcity.

Method: TreeNet integrates features from neural networks, ensemble learning, and tree-based decision models into a layered decision ensemble learning methodology tailored for medical image analysis.

Result: Achieved F1-score of 0.85 with full training data and 0.77 with 50% training data (only 0.08 reduction), with real-time performance of 32 FPS suitable for medical applications.

Conclusion: TreeNet demonstrates efficiency and usability in demanding medical image analysis scenarios, particularly for real-time applications, offering superior performance, interpretability, and adaptability across complex machine learning tasks.

Abstract: Within the domain of medical image analysis, three distinct methodologies
have demonstrated commendable accuracy: Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and
Ensemble-Based Learning Algorithms, particularly in the specialized context of
genstro institutional track abnormalities detection. These approaches exhibit
efficacy in disease detection scenarios where a substantial volume of data is
available. However, the prevalent challenge in medical image analysis pertains
to limited data availability and data confidence. This paper introduces
TreeNet, a novel layered decision ensemble learning methodology tailored for
medical image analysis. Constructed by integrating pivotal features from neural
networks, ensemble learning, and tree-based decision models, TreeNet emerges as
a potent and adaptable model capable of delivering superior performance across
diverse and intricate machine learning tasks. Furthermore, its interpretability
and insightful decision-making process enhance its applicability in complex
medical scenarios. Evaluation of the proposed approach encompasses key metrics
including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and training and evaluation time. The
methodology resulted in an F1-score of up to 0.85 when using the complete
training data, with an F1-score of 0.77 when utilizing 50\% of the training
data. This shows a reduction of F1-score of 0.08 while in the reduction of 50\%
of the training data and training time. The evaluation of the methodology
resulted in the 32 Frame per Second which is usable for the realtime
applications. This comprehensive assessment underscores the efficiency and
usability of TreeNet in the demanding landscape of medical image analysis
specially in the realtime analysis.

### [4] [OmniSAT: Compact Action Token, Faster Auto Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09667)
*Huaihai Lyu,Chaofan Chen,Senwei Xie,Pengwei Wang,Xiansheng Chen,Shanghang Zhang,Changsheng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniSAT introduces an efficient action tokenizer that compresses action sequences 6.8x while preserving reconstruction quality, enabling faster auto-regressive training and better performance through cross-embodiment learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing auto-regressive VLA models struggle with long action sequences that lead to inefficient training. Prior compression methods suffered from poor reconstruction or inefficient compression.

Method: Uses B-Spline encoding for consistent representation, multi-stage residual quantization for position/rotation/gripper subspaces, and cross-embodiment learning that leverages both robot and human demonstrations.

Result: Achieves 6.8x sequence length reduction, lower target entropy, faster training convergence, and improved model performance across real-robot and simulation experiments.

Conclusion: OmniSAT provides an efficient action tokenization approach that enables scalable VLA model training while maintaining reconstruction quality through unified action representation.

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models can be broadly categorized into
diffusion-based and auto-regressive (AR) approaches: diffusion models capture
continuous action distributions but rely on computationally heavy iterative
denoising. In contrast, AR models enable efficient optimization and flexible
sequence construction, making them better suited for large-scale pretraining.
To further improve AR efficiency, particularly when action chunks induce
extended and high-dimensional sequences, prior work applies entropy-guided and
token-frequency techniques to shorten the sequence length. However, such
compression struggled with \textit{poor reconstruction or inefficient
compression}. Motivated by this, we introduce an Omni Swift Action Tokenizer,
which learns a compact, transferable action representation. Specifically, we
first normalize value ranges and temporal horizons to obtain a consistent
representation with B-Spline encoding. Then, we apply multi-stage residual
quantization to the position, rotation, and gripper subspaces, producing
compressed discrete tokens with coarse-to-fine granularity for each part. After
pre-training on the large-scale dataset Droid, the resulting discrete
tokenization shortens the training sequence by 6.8$\times$, and lowers the
target entropy. To further explore the potential of OmniSAT, we develop a
cross-embodiment learning strategy that builds on the unified action-pattern
space and jointly leverages robot and human demonstrations. It enables scalable
auxiliary supervision from heterogeneous egocentric videos. Across diverse
real-robot and simulation experiments, OmniSAT encompasses higher compression
while preserving reconstruction quality, enabling faster AR training
convergence and model performance.

### [5] [Knowledge-Aware Mamba for Joint Change Detection and Classification from MODIS Times Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09679)
*Zhengsen Xu,Yimin Zhu,Zack Dewis,Mabel Heffring,Motasem Alkayid,Saeid Taleghanidoozdoozan,Lincoln Linlin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents KAMamba, a knowledge-aware Mamba model for MODIS change detection that addresses mixed pixels, information coupling, and class heterogeneity through knowledge-driven transitions, multi-task learning, and specialized Mamba modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MODIS change detection faces challenges including mixed pixels, spatial-spectral-temporal information coupling effects, and background class heterogeneity, which limit detection accuracy.

Method: Proposes KAMamba with: 1) knowledge-driven transition-matrix-guided approach with KAT-loss, 2) multi-task learning with PreC-loss, PostC-loss, and Chg-loss, 3) SSTMamba modules to disentangle information coupling, and 4) SDMamba backbone for efficiency.

Result: On MODIS time-series dataset for Saskatchewan, Canada: 1.5-6% gains in average F1 for change detection over baselines, and about 2% improvements in OA, AA, and Kappa for LULC classification.

Conclusion: KAMamba effectively addresses MODIS change detection challenges through knowledge-aware transitions, multi-task learning, and efficient Mamba-based architecture, demonstrating significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Although change detection using MODIS time series is critical for
environmental monitoring, it is a highly challenging task due to key MODIS
difficulties, e.g., mixed pixels, spatial-spectral-temporal information
coupling effect, and background class heterogeneity. This paper presents a
novel knowledge-aware Mamba (KAMamba) for enhanced MODIS change detection, with
the following contributions. First, to leverage knowledge regarding class
transitions, we design a novel knowledge-driven transition-matrix-guided
approach, leading to a knowledge-aware transition loss (KAT-loss) that can
enhance detection accuracies. Second, to improve model constraints, a
multi-task learning approach is designed, where three losses, i.e., pre-change
classification loss (PreC-loss), post-change classification loss (PostC-loss),
and change detection loss (Chg-loss) are used for improve model learning.
Third, to disentangle information coupling in MODIS time series, novel
spatial-spectral-temporal Mamba (SSTMamba) modules are designed. Last, to
improve Mamba model efficiency and remove computational cost, a sparse and
deformable Mamba (SDMamba) backbone is used in SSTMamba. On the MODIS
time-series dataset for Saskatchewan, Canada, we evaluate the method on
land-cover change detection and LULC classification; results show about 1.5-6%
gains in average F1 for change detection over baselines, and about 2%
improvements in OA, AA, and Kappa for LULC classification.

### [6] [NNDM: NN_UNet Diffusion Model for Brain Tumor Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09681)
*Sashank Makanaboyina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NNDM is a hybrid framework combining NN-UNet with diffusion models to improve brain tumor segmentation in MRI by iteratively refining segmentation masks through denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CNN models like U-Net struggle with generalization, boundary precision, and limited data diversity in brain tumor segmentation tasks.

Method: Integrates NN-UNet's feature extraction with diffusion probabilistic models that learn residual error distribution between predicted and ground-truth masks through iterative denoising.

Result: Outperforms conventional U-Net and transformer-based baselines on BraTS 2021 datasets, showing improvements in Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance metrics with enhanced robustness across modalities and tumor subregions.

Conclusion: NNDM establishes a new direction for combining deterministic segmentation networks with stochastic diffusion models, advancing automated brain tumor analysis.

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) are critical for effective diagnosis and treatment planning.
Despite advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as U-Net,
existing models often struggle with generalization, boundary precision, and
limited data diversity. To address these challenges, we propose NNDM (NN\_UNet
Diffusion Model)a hybrid framework that integrates the robust feature
extraction of NN-UNet with the generative capabilities of diffusion
probabilistic models. In our approach, the diffusion model progressively
refines the segmentation masks generated by NN-UNet by learning the residual
error distribution between predicted and ground-truth masks. This iterative
denoising process enables the model to correct fine structural inconsistencies
and enhance tumor boundary delineation. Experiments conducted on the BraTS 2021
datasets demonstrate that NNDM achieves superior performance compared to
conventional U-Net and transformer-based baselines, yielding improvements in
Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance metrics. Moreover, the diffusion-guided
refinement enhances robustness across modalities and tumor subregions. The
proposed NNDM establishes a new direction for combining deterministic
segmentation networks with stochastic diffusion models, advancing the state of
the art in automated brain tumor analysis.

### [7] [Adaptive Fusion Network with Temporal-Ranked and Motion-Intensity Dynamic Images for Micro-expression Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09730)
*Thi Bich Phuong Man,Luu Tu Nguyen,Vu Tram Anh Khuong,Thanh Ha Le,Thi Duyen Ngo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel micro-expression recognition (MER) method that uses two complementary representations and an adaptive fusion network to achieve state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Micro-expressions are subtle facial changes that reveal genuine emotions but are difficult to detect with the naked eye, making automated recognition valuable for lie detection, behavioral analysis, and psychological assessment.

Method: The method uses two complementary representations: Temporal-ranked dynamic image (emphasizing temporal progression) and Motion-intensity dynamic image (highlighting subtle motions through frame reordering). These are integrated using an Adaptive fusion network that automatically learns optimal integration.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance: 93.95% Accuracy and 0.897 UF1 on CASME-II, 82.47% Accuracy and 0.665 UF1 on SAMM, and 76.00% Accuracy on MMEW, demonstrating strong generalization across datasets.

Conclusion: Both the input representations and the proposed architecture play crucial roles in improving MER performance, providing a solid foundation for applications in affective computing, lie detection, and human-computer interaction.

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are subtle, transient facial changes with very low
intensity, almost imperceptible to the naked eye, yet they reveal a person
genuine emotion. They are of great value in lie detection, behavioral analysis,
and psychological assessment. This paper proposes a novel MER method with two
main contributions. First, we propose two complementary representations -
Temporal-ranked dynamic image, which emphasizes temporal progression, and
Motion-intensity dynamic image, which highlights subtle motions through a frame
reordering mechanism incorporating motion intensity. Second, we propose an
Adaptive fusion network, which automatically learns to optimally integrate
these two representations, thereby enhancing discriminative ME features while
suppressing noise. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (CASME-II, SAMM and
MMEW) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. Specifically, AFN
achieves 93.95 Accuracy and 0.897 UF1 on CASME-II, setting a new
state-of-the-art benchmark. On SAMM, the method attains 82.47 Accuracy and
0.665 UF1, demonstrating more balanced recognition across classes. On MMEW, the
model achieves 76.00 Accuracy, further confirming its generalization ability.
The obtained results show that both the input and the proposed architecture
play important roles in improving the performance of MER. Moreover, they
provide a solid foundation for further research and practical applications in
the fields of affective computing, lie detection, and human-computer
interaction.

*Muhammad Munsif,Waqas Ahmad,Amjid Ali,Mohib Ullah,Adnan Hussain,Sung Wook Baik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This survey provides the first comprehensive review of Connected Vision Systems (CVS) that unifies multi-view multi-camera tracking, re-identification, and action understanding into a single framework, addressing the gap in existing literature that treats these tasks in isolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing surveys focus on isolated vision tasks like tracking, Re-ID, and action understanding separately, often overlooking their integration in multi-camera systems and the complexities of real-world deployment with occlusions, diverse viewpoints, and environmental variability.

Method: The authors propose a unique taxonomy dividing CVS into four key components: MVMC tracking, Re-ID, action understanding, and combined methods. They systematically review state-of-the-art datasets, methodologies, results, and evaluation metrics, and identify open research challenges.

Result: The survey provides a structured view of the field's progression and identifies critical research gaps in integrating multi-view multi-camera systems, highlighting the need for unified approaches rather than isolated task solutions.

Conclusion: The paper outlines key research directions for enhancing CVS robustness, efficiency, and adaptability in complex real-world applications, and discusses emerging technologies like lifelong learning, privacy, and federated learning that need to be addressed for future advancements.

Abstract: Connected Vision Systems (CVS) are transforming a variety of applications,
including autonomous vehicles, smart cities, surveillance, and human-robot
interaction. These systems harness multi-view multi-camera (MVMC) data to
provide enhanced situational awareness through the integration of MVMC
tracking, re-identification (Re-ID), and action understanding (AU). However,
deploying CVS in real-world, dynamic environments presents a number of
challenges, particularly in addressing occlusions, diverse viewpoints, and
environmental variability. Existing surveys have focused primarily on isolated
tasks such as tracking, Re-ID, and AU, often neglecting their integration into
a cohesive system. These reviews typically emphasize single-view setups,
overlooking the complexities and opportunities provided by multi-camera
collaboration and multi-view data analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this
survey is the first to offer a comprehensive and integrated review of MVMC that
unifies MVMC tracking, Re-ID, and AU into a single framework. We propose a
unique taxonomy to better understand the critical components of CVS, dividing
it into four key parts: MVMC tracking, Re-ID, AU, and combined methods. We
systematically arrange and summarize the state-of-the-art datasets,
methodologies, results, and evaluation metrics, providing a structured view of
the field's progression. Furthermore, we identify and discuss the open research
questions and challenges, along with emerging technologies such as lifelong
learning, privacy, and federated learning, that need to be addressed for future
advancements. The paper concludes by outlining key research directions for
enhancing the robustness, efficiency, and adaptability of CVS in complex,
real-world applications. We hope this survey will inspire innovative solutions
and guide future research toward the next generation of intelligent and
adaptive CVS.

### [9] [Constructive Distortion: Improving MLLMs with Attention-Guided Image Warping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09741)
*Dwip Dalal,Gautam Vashishtha,Utkarsh Mishra,Jeonghwan Kim,Madhav Kanda,Hyeonjeong Ha,Svetlana Lazebnik,Heng Ji,Unnat Jain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttWarp improves MLLM performance by warping input images to allocate more resolution to query-relevant regions using cross-modal attention, without changing model weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often miss small details and spatial relations in cluttered scenes, leading to errors in fine-grained perceptual grounding.

Method: Uses MLLM's cross-modal attention to perform rectilinear warping of input images, reallocating spatial resolution toward important regions while preserving global context.

Result: Consistently improves accuracy across five benchmarks and four MLLMs, strengthens compositional reasoning, and reduces hallucinations, outperforming four competitive baselines.

Conclusion: Attention-guided warping effectively prioritizes query-relevant information while preserving context, and MLLMs perform better with such warped inputs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often miss small details and spatial
relations in cluttered scenes, leading to errors in fine-grained perceptual
grounding. We introduce AttWarp, a lightweight method that allocates more
resolution to query-relevant content while compressing less informative areas,
all while preserving global context. At test time, the approach uses an MLLM's
cross-modal attention to perform rectilinear warping of the input image,
reallocating spatial resolution toward regions the model deems important,
without changing model weights or architecture. This attention-guided warping
preserves all original image information but redistributes it non-uniformly, so
small objects and subtle relationships become easier for the same model to read
while the global layout remains intact. Across five benchmarks (TextVQA, GQA,
DocVQA, POPE, MMMU) and four MLLMs (LLaVA, Qwen-VL, InternVL, and
InstructBLIP), AttWarp consistently improves accuracy, strengthens
compositional reasoning, and reduces hallucinations, outperforming four
competitive baselines that manipulate raw images at test time. Together, these
results show that attention-guided warping prioritizes information relevant to
the query while preserving context, and that the same MLLMs perform better when
given such warped inputs.

*Yufei Wang,Adriana Kovashka,Loretta Fernández,Marc N. Coutanche,Seth Wiener*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Study examines how learners infer unfamiliar words in multimodal contexts using image-text pairs, analyzing features that aid inference and AI's ability to predict learner performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how learners infer word meanings from multimodal contexts and identify features that facilitate this learning process, while also exploring AI's capability to reason about learner performance.

Method: Conducted studies with human participants using different image-text pairs, analyzing data features (images and texts) that help infer masked/unfamiliar words, and correlating language backgrounds with success.

Result: Found that only some intuitive features strongly correlate with participant performance, indicating need for further investigation of predictive features. AI systems show potential but need improvement in reasoning about participant performance.

Conclusion: The study reveals gaps in understanding predictive features for successful word inference in multimodal contexts and identifies promising directions for enhancing AI's reasoning capabilities about human learning performance.

Abstract: We investigate a new setting for foreign language learning, where learners
infer the meaning of unfamiliar words in a multimodal context of a sentence
describing a paired image. We conduct studies with human participants using
different image-text pairs. We analyze the features of the data (i.e., images
and texts) that make it easier for participants to infer the meaning of a
masked or unfamiliar word, and what language backgrounds of the participants
correlate with success. We find only some intuitive features have strong
correlations with participant performance, prompting the need for further
investigating of predictive features for success in these tasks. We also
analyze the ability of AI systems to reason about participant performance, and
discover promising future directions for improving this reasoning ability.

*Weiqing Luo,Zhen Tan,Yifan Li,Xinyu Zhao,Kwonjoon Lee,Behzad Dariush,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to determine optimal image resolution for vision-language tasks and extends VLLMs to handle variable resolutions efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLLMs use fixed resolutions for all tasks, leading to suboptimal performance. Different vision-language tasks require varying perceptual granularity.

Method: 1) Investigated resolution preferences correlated with image complexity and VLLM uncertainty variance; 2) Proposed empirical formula to determine optimal resolution; 3) Developed parameter-efficient fine-tuning to extend VLLMs to optimal resolutions.

Result: Extensive experiments on various vision-language tasks validated the method's effectiveness, showing improved performance over fixed-resolution approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enables VLLMs to adapt to optimal resolutions for different tasks, addressing the limitations of fixed-resolution models and improving overall performance.

Abstract: Real-world vision-language applications demand varying levels of perceptual
granularity. However, most existing visual large language models (VLLMs), such
as LLaVA, pre-assume a fixed resolution for downstream tasks, which leads to
subpar performance. To address this problem, we first conduct a comprehensive
and pioneering investigation into the resolution preferences of different
vision-language tasks, revealing a correlation between resolution preferences
with image complexity, and uncertainty variance of the VLLM at different image
input resolutions. Building on this insight, we propose an empirical formula to
determine the optimal resolution for a given vision-language task, combining
these two factors. Second, based on rigorous experiments, we propose a novel
parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique to extend the visual input resolution
of pre-trained VLLMs to the identified optimal resolution. Extensive
experiments on various vision-language tasks validate the effectiveness of our
method.

TL;DR: This study evaluates different Conditional Random Field (CRF) models to improve image segmentation clarity, particularly for low-quality satellite images, and compares their performance on both satellite and aerial photography datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image segmentation outputs often lack clarity due to low-quality features in satellite images, necessitating better CRF models to achieve improved segmentation results.

Method: The researchers tested various CRF models, analyzing their suitability for image segmentation, and evaluated them on two datasets: low-quality satellite imagery and high-quality aerial photographs.

Result: The study identified which CRF models perform best on different image types and revealed the strengths and weaknesses of various approaches through comparative analysis.

Conclusion: Different CRF approaches have specific pitfalls and potentials, with some models being more suitable than others for improving segmentation clarity in satellite imagery versus aerial photography.

Abstract: The output of image the segmentation process is usually not very clear due to
low quality features of Satellite images. The purpose of this study is to find
a suitable Conditional Random Field (CRF) to achieve better clarity in a
segmented image. We started with different types of CRFs and studied them as to
why they are or are not suitable for our purpose. We evaluated our approach on
two different datasets - Satellite imagery having low quality features and high
quality Aerial photographs. During the study we experimented with various CRFs
to find which CRF gives the best results on images and compared our results on
these datasets to show the pitfalls and potentials of different approaches.

### [13] [Exploration of Incremental Synthetic Non-Morphed Images for Single Morphing Attack Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09836)
*David Benavente-Rios,Juan Ruiz Rodriguez,Gustavo Gatica*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using synthetic face data can improve Single-Morphing Attack Detection (S-MAD) when carefully incorporated with real data, but relying solely on synthetic data leads to poor performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns and limited availability of large-scale bona fide face image datasets for S-MAD by exploring synthetic data alternatives.

Method: Used various morphing tools and cross-dataset evaluation with incremental testing protocol to assess generalization as synthetic images were added.

Result: Generalization improves with controlled synthetic data integration or gradual addition of bona fide images, but indiscriminate synthetic data use degrades performance. Pure synthetic data achieves highest EER.

Conclusion: Synthetic data can enhance S-MAD when carefully combined with real data, but should not be used exclusively as it leads to sub-optimal detection performance.

Abstract: This paper investigates the use of synthetic face data to enhance
Single-Morphing Attack Detection (S-MAD), addressing the limitations of
availability of large-scale datasets of bona fide images due to privacy
concerns. Various morphing tools and cross-dataset evaluation schemes were
utilized to conduct this study. An incremental testing protocol was implemented
to assess the generalization capabilities as more and more synthetic images
were added. The results of the experiments show that generalization can be
improved by carefully incorporating a controlled number of synthetic images
into existing datasets or by gradually adding bona fide images during training.
However, indiscriminate use of synthetic data can lead to sub-optimal
performance. Evenmore, the use of only synthetic data (morphed and non-morphed
images) achieves the highest Equal Error Rate (EER), which means in operational
scenarios the best option is not relying only on synthetic data for S-MAD.

*Peixian Liang,Yifan Ding,Yizhe Zhang,Jianxu Chen,Hao Zheng,Hongxiao Wang,Yejia Zhang,Guangyu Meng,Tim Weninger,Michael Niemier,X. Sharon Hu,Danny Z Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ceb is a novel pixel clustering method for cell instance segmentation that leverages cell boundary features and labels to divide foreground pixels into cell instances, outperforming existing pixel clustering methods and achieving competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for cell instance segmentation use pixel-wise objectives that may lose important geometric properties of cells (shape, curvature, convexity). The authors aim to preserve these geometric features by focusing on boundary representations rather than individual pixels.

Method: Ceb uses probability maps from semantic segmentation, extracts potential foreground-foreground boundaries with a revised Watershed algorithm, constructs boundary signatures by sampling pixels from current and neighboring boundaries, applies a boundary classifier to predict binary boundary labels, and finally divides/merges regions based on predicted boundaries.

Result: Extensive experiments on six datasets show Ceb outperforms existing pixel clustering methods on semantic segmentation probability maps and achieves highly competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art cell instance segmentation methods.

Conclusion: The Ceb method successfully addresses the limitation of pixel-wise objectives by leveraging boundary features, demonstrating that boundary-based approaches can effectively preserve geometric properties and improve cell instance segmentation performance.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for cell instance segmentation are based on
deep learning (DL) semantic segmentation approaches, focusing on distinguishing
foreground pixels from background pixels. In order to identify cell instances
from foreground pixels (e.g., pixel clustering), most methods decompose
instance information into pixel-wise objectives, such as distances to
foreground-background boundaries (distance maps), heat gradients with the
center point as heat source (heat diffusion maps), and distances from the
center point to foreground-background boundaries with fixed angles (star-shaped
polygons). However, pixel-wise objectives may lose significant geometric
properties of the cell instances, such as shape, curvature, and convexity,
which require a collection of pixels to represent. To address this challenge,
we present a novel pixel clustering method, called Ceb (for Cell boundaries),
to leverage cell boundary features and labels to divide foreground pixels into
cell instances. Starting with probability maps generated from semantic
segmentation, Ceb first extracts potential foreground-foreground boundaries
with a revised Watershed algorithm. For each boundary candidate, a boundary
feature representation (called boundary signature) is constructed by sampling
pixels from the current foreground-foreground boundary as well as the
neighboring background-foreground boundaries. Next, a boundary classifier is
used to predict its binary boundary label based on the corresponding boundary
signature. Finally, cell instances are obtained by dividing or merging
neighboring regions based on the predicted boundary labels. Extensive
experiments on six datasets demonstrate that Ceb outperforms existing pixel
clustering methods on semantic segmentation probability maps. Moreover, Ceb
achieves highly competitive performance compared to SOTA cell instance
segmentation methods.

### [15] [Cluster-Aware Prompt Ensemble Learning for Few-Shot Vision-Language Model Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09867)
*Zhi Chen,Xin Yu,Xiaohui Tao,Yan Li,Zi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAPEL is a framework that improves prompt ensembling in vision-language models by preserving cluster nature of context prompts and ensembling in logits space rather than feature space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional prompt ensembling that averages textual features often yields suboptimal results because feature averaging shifts class centroids away from true class distribution.

Method: CAPEL classifies images into class clusters represented by distinct prompts, ensembles in classification logits space, uses cluster-preserving regularization, and adaptive prompt weighting.

Result: The method aligns better with visual feature distribution and maintains cluster-specific discriminative power while preventing collapse into uniform direction.

Conclusion: CAPEL provides robust performance across diverse datasets and tasks by optimizing prompt fine-tuning while preserving cluster nature of context prompts.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve zero-shot transfer across
various tasks by pre-training on numerous image-text pairs. These models often
benefit from using an ensemble of context prompts to represent a class. Despite
being effective, conventional prompt ensembling that averages textual features
of context prompts often yields suboptimal results. This is because feature
averaging shifts the class centroids away from the true class distribution. To
address this issue, we propose the Cluster-Aware Prompt Ensemble Learning
(CAPEL) framework, which preserves the cluster nature of context prompts. CAPEL
classifies images into one of several class clusters, each represented by a
distinct prompt. Instead of ensembling prompts in the feature space, we perform
ensembling in the classification logits space, aligning better with the visual
feature distribution. To further optimize prompt fine-tuning while maintaining
cluster-specific discriminative power, we introduce a cluster-preserving
regularization term. This ensures that prompts remain distinct and specialized
for different clusters, preventing collapse into a uniform direction.
Additionally, we integrate an adaptive prompt weighting technique to
dynamically adjust the attention weights for flawed or ambiguous prompts,
ensuring robust performance across diverse datasets and tasks.

### [16] [Fast Self-Supervised depth and mask aware Association for Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09878)
*Milad Khanchi,Maria Amer,Charalambos Poullis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a multi-object tracking method that uses fused depth and mask features through a self-supervised encoder for object matching, avoiding computationally expensive segmentation IoU calculations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MOT methods rely on IoU for association, which becomes unreliable with similar/occluded objects and is computationally expensive for segmentation masks.

Method: Fuses depth maps (from zero-shot depth estimator) and object masks (from promptable visual segmentation model) through a compact self-supervised encoder to produce stable object representations. Uses these representations alongside bounding box IoU and re-ID features for matching in a tracking-by-detection framework.

Result: Outperforms TBD state-of-the-art on challenging benchmarks with non-linear motion, occlusion, and crowded scenes (SportsMOT, DanceTrack), while achieving competitive performance on simpler benchmarks with linear motion (MOT17).

Conclusion: The method successfully leverages depth and mask features through self-supervised learning to improve tracking performance without computing expensive segmentation IoU, particularly excelling in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) methods often rely on Intersection-over-Union
(IoU) for association. However, this becomes unreliable when objects are
similar or occluded. Also, computing IoU for segmentation masks is
computationally expensive. In this work, we use segmentation masks to capture
object shapes, but we do not compute segmentation IoU. Instead, we fuse depth
and mask features and pass them through a compact encoder trained
self-supervised. This encoder produces stable object representations, which we
use as an additional similarity cue alongside bounding box IoU and
re-identification features for matching. We obtain depth maps from a zero-shot
depth estimator and object masks from a promptable visual segmentation model to
obtain fine-grained spatial cues. Our MOT method is the first to use the
self-supervised encoder to refine segmentation masks without computing masks
IoU. MOT can be divided into joint detection-ReID (JDR) and
tracking-by-detection (TBD) models. The latter are computationally more
efficient. Experiments of our TBD method on challenging benchmarks with
non-linear motion, occlusion, and crowded scenes, such as SportsMOT and
DanceTrack, show that our method outperforms the TBD state-of-the-art on most
metrics, while achieving competitive performance on simpler benchmarks with
linear motion, such as MOT17.

*Minkwan Kim,Changwoon Choi,Young Min Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Scene-adaptive strategies for efficient representation capacity allocation in generating immersive indoor experiences from incomplete observations, using geometric priors to optimize basis placement and virtual viewpoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Indoor scenes with multiple rooms have irregular layouts with varying complexity, clutter, occlusion, and flat walls, requiring efficient use of limited resources for immersive experience generation.

Method: Use geometric priors from pre-processing to guide optimal placement of bases on estimated geometric scaffold, and employ scene-adaptive virtual viewpoints to compensate for geometric deficiencies in input trajectory.

Result: Significant enhancements in rendering quality and memory requirements compared to baselines using regular placements, demonstrated through comprehensive analysis in large-scale indoor scenes.

Conclusion: Scene-adaptive strategies with geometric guidance greatly improve upon uniform basis arrangements in scalable Neural Radiance Field representations for indoor environments.

Abstract: We propose scene-adaptive strategies to efficiently allocate representation
capacity for generating immersive experiences of indoor environments from
incomplete observations. Indoor scenes with multiple rooms often exhibit
irregular layouts with varying complexity, containing clutter, occlusion, and
flat walls. We maximize the utilization of limited resources with guidance from
geometric priors, which are often readily available after pre-processing
stages. We record observation statistics on the estimated geometric scaffold
and guide the optimal placement of bases, which greatly improves upon the
uniform basis arrangements adopted by previous scalable Neural Radiance Field
(NeRF) representations. We also suggest scene-adaptive virtual viewpoints to
compensate for geometric deficiencies inherent in view configurations in the
input trajectory and impose the necessary regularization. We present a
comprehensive analysis and discussion regarding rendering quality and memory
requirements in several large-scale indoor scenes, demonstrating significant
enhancements compared to baselines that employ regular placements.

### [19] [LTGS: Long-Term Gaussian Scene Chronology From Sparse View Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09881)
*Minkwan Kim,Seungmin Lee,Junho Kim,Young Min Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LTGS is a novel scene representation that models long-term environmental changes from sparse casual captures using template Gaussians and refinement pipelines, enabling efficient updates and superior reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current novel-view synthesis methods struggle with everyday scene changes from casual captures, requiring dense spatial and temporal observations. There's a need for efficient representations that can handle sparse-view updates while embracing environmental variations.

Method: Uses Gaussian splatting representation with object templates as structural priors, followed by a refinement pipeline that adapts to temporal variations through few-shot observations. The framework employs simple transformations for generalizability across multiple time steps.

Result: Achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to baselines while enabling fast and lightweight updates. The method is validated on real-world datasets specifically collected for long-term scene changes with sparse capture setups.

Conclusion: LTGS provides an efficient solution for modeling long-term scene chronology from sparse casual captures, significantly enhancing scalability for temporal evolution of 3D environments while maintaining high reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in novel-view synthesis can create the photo-realistic
visualization of real-world environments from conventional camera captures.
However, acquiring everyday environments from casual captures faces challenges
due to frequent scene changes, which require dense observations both spatially
and temporally. We propose long-term Gaussian scene chronology from sparse-view
updates, coined LTGS, an efficient scene representation that can embrace
everyday changes from highly under-constrained casual captures. Given an
incomplete and unstructured Gaussian splatting representation obtained from an
initial set of input images, we robustly model the long-term chronology of the
scene despite abrupt movements and subtle environmental variations. We
construct objects as template Gaussians, which serve as structural, reusable
priors for shared object tracks. Then, the object templates undergo a further
refinement pipeline that modulates the priors to adapt to temporally varying
environments based on few-shot observations. Once trained, our framework is
generalizable across multiple time steps through simple transformations,
significantly enhancing the scalability for a temporal evolution of 3D
environments. As existing datasets do not explicitly represent the long-term
real-world changes with a sparse capture setup, we collect real-world datasets
to evaluate the practicality of our pipeline. Experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to other baselines
while enabling fast and light-weight updates.

### [20] [An uncertainty-aware framework for data-efficient multi-view animal pose estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09903)
*Lenny Aharon,Keemin Lee,Karan Sikka,Selmaan Chettih,Cole Hurwitz,Liam Paninski,Matthew R Whiteway*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A comprehensive framework for multi-view animal pose estimation that combines novel training techniques, post-processing methods, and model distillation to achieve accurate tracking with limited labeled data and improved uncertainty estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-view pose estimation methods struggle with accurate tracking using limited labeled data and provide poor uncertainty estimates, which hinders reliable behavioral analysis in scientific research.

Method: Uses multi-view transformer (MVT) with pretrained backbones for simultaneous cross-view processing, patch masking for robust cross-view correspondences without camera calibration, geometric consistency through 3D augmentation and triangulation loss for calibrated setups, extended Ensemble Kalman Smoother (EKS) for post-processing, variance inflation for uncertainty quantification, and distillation procedure using EKS predictions for pseudo-label generation.

Result: Framework components consistently outperform existing methods across three diverse animal species (flies, mice, chickadees), with each component providing complementary benefits for reliable pose estimation.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical, uncertainty-aware system for reliable pose estimation that enables downstream behavioral analyses under real-world data constraints, reducing dependence on manual labels through effective distillation.

Abstract: Multi-view pose estimation is essential for quantifying animal behavior in
scientific research, yet current methods struggle to achieve accurate tracking
with limited labeled data and suffer from poor uncertainty estimates. We
address these challenges with a comprehensive framework combining novel
training and post-processing techniques, and a model distillation procedure
that leverages the strengths of these techniques to produce a more efficient
and effective pose estimator. Our multi-view transformer (MVT) utilizes
pretrained backbones and enables simultaneous processing of information across
all views, while a novel patch masking scheme learns robust cross-view
correspondences without camera calibration. For calibrated setups, we
incorporate geometric consistency through 3D augmentation and a triangulation
loss. We extend the existing Ensemble Kalman Smoother (EKS) post-processor to
the nonlinear case and enhance uncertainty quantification via a variance
inflation technique. Finally, to leverage the scaling properties of the MVT, we
design a distillation procedure that exploits improved EKS predictions and
uncertainty estimates to generate high-quality pseudo-labels, thereby reducing
dependence on manual labels. Our framework components consistently outperform
existing methods across three diverse animal species (flies, mice, chickadees),
with each component contributing complementary benefits. The result is a
practical, uncertainty-aware system for reliable pose estimation that enables
downstream behavioral analyses under real-world data constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture successfully integrates HSI into UAV perception systems, providing enhanced capabilities for reliable operation in complex environments through efficient spectral-spatial feature fusion.

Abstract: The relevance of this research lies in the growing demand for unmanned aerial

### [22] [HeadsUp! High-Fidelity Portrait Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09924)
*Renjie Li,Zihao Zhu,Xiaoyu Wang,Zhengzhong Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HeadsUp is a single-step diffusion model for portrait image super-resolution that handles both faces and backgrounds seamlessly in one step, eliminating blending artifacts from traditional multi-model approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing super-resolution methods use separate models for faces and backgrounds, causing blending artifacts. Human perception is particularly sensitive to facial fidelity, so a unified approach is needed.

Method: Built on single-step diffusion model with face supervision mechanism to focus on facial regions and reference-based mechanism for identity restoration. Uses newly created PortraitSR-4K dataset for training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on portrait image super-resolution while maintaining comparable or better performance on general image and aligned face datasets.

Conclusion: HeadsUp provides an effective end-to-end solution for portrait image super-resolution that eliminates blending artifacts and maintains high facial fidelity.

Abstract: Portrait pictures, which typically feature both human subjects and natural
backgrounds, are one of the most prevalent forms of photography on social
media. Existing image super-resolution (ISR) techniques generally focus either
on generic real-world images or strictly aligned facial images (i.e., face
super-resolution). In practice, separate models are blended to handle portrait
photos: the face specialist model handles the face region, and the general
model processes the rest. However, these blending approaches inevitably
introduce blending or boundary artifacts around the facial regions due to
different model training recipes, while human perception is particularly
sensitive to facial fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we study the
portrait image supersolution (PortraitISR) problem, and propose HeadsUp, a
single-step diffusion model that is capable of seamlessly restoring and
upscaling portrait images in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we build our
model on top of a single-step diffusion model and develop a face supervision
mechanism to guide the model in focusing on the facial region. We then
integrate a reference-based mechanism to help with identity restoration,
reducing face ambiguity in low-quality face restoration. Additionally, we have
built a high-quality 4K portrait image ISR dataset dubbed PortraitSR-4K, to
support model training and benchmarking for portrait images. Extensive
experiments show that HeadsUp achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
PortraitISR task while maintaining comparable or higher performance on both
general image and aligned face datasets.

*Nilesh Jain,Elie Alhajjar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes using denoising diffusion models and Controlnet to enhance underwater image datasets by expanding diversity (stereo, wide-angled, macro images) and improving image quality, addressing limitations in current marine ecosystem research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater images are crucial for ocean research but suffer from poor quality due to complex environments, and existing datasets lack diversity (mostly monocular images) and have low quality, limiting effective marine ecosystem study.

Method: 1) Expand datasets using denoising diffusion model to include various image types (stereo, wide-angled, macro, close-up); 2) Enhance image quality using Controlnet to evaluate and improve dataset quality.

Result: The proposed approach aims to overcome limitations of poor generalization and heavy reliance on clean datasets in underwater image enhancement research by creating more diverse and higher quality datasets.

Conclusion: By leveraging denoising diffusion and Controlnet, this methodology can significantly improve underwater image datasets, enabling better marine ecosystem research through enhanced image quality and diversity.

Abstract: Underwater images play a crucial role in ocean research and marine
environmental monitoring since they provide quality information about the
ecosystem. However, the complex and remote nature of the environment results in
poor image quality with issues such as low visibility, blurry textures, color
distortion, and noise. In recent years, research in image enhancement has
proven to be effective but also presents its own limitations, like poor
generalization and heavy reliance on clean datasets. One of the challenges
herein is the lack of diversity and the low quality of images included in these
datasets. Also, most existing datasets consist only of monocular images, a fact
that limits the representation of different lighting conditions and angles. In
this paper, we propose a new plan of action to overcome these limitations. On
one hand, we call for expanding the datasets using a denoising diffusion model
to include a variety of image types such as stereo, wide-angled, macro, and
close-up images. On the other hand, we recommend enhancing the images using
Controlnet to evaluate and increase the quality of the corresponding datasets,
and hence improve the study of the marine ecosystem.

*Agampreet Aulakh,Nils D. Forkert,Matthias Wilms*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new method using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) to model brain aging trajectories from longitudinal MRI data, achieving 81.3% accuracy in classifying healthy vs dementia-like aging patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Longitudinal MRI data analysis is challenging due to discrete, irregular sampling patterns across individuals and populations, which traditional deep learning methods struggle to represent as continuous biological processes.

Method: Developed a novel INR architecture that partially disentangles spatial and temporal trajectory parameters, creating a framework that operates directly on INR parameter space for brain aging trajectory classification. Evaluated using biologically grounded trajectory simulations with regular and irregular sampling.

Result: In irregular sampling experiments (more realistic scenario), the INR-based method achieved 81.3% accuracy for brain aging trajectory classification, outperforming a standard deep learning baseline model (73.7%).

Conclusion: INRs provide an effective approach for modeling continuous brain aging trajectories from irregularly sampled longitudinal MRI data, enabling better classification of healthy vs pathological aging patterns.

Abstract: The human brain undergoes dynamic, potentially pathology-driven, structural
changes throughout a lifespan. Longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
and other neuroimaging data are valuable for characterizing trajectories of
change associated with typical and atypical aging. However, the analysis of
such data is highly challenging given their discrete nature with different
spatial and temporal image sampling patterns within individuals and across
populations. This leads to computational problems for most traditional deep
learning methods that cannot represent the underlying continuous biological
process. To address these limitations, we present a new, fully data-driven
method for representing aging trajectories across the entire brain by modelling
subject-specific longitudinal T1-weighted MRI data as continuous functions
using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). Therefore, we introduce a novel
INR architecture capable of partially disentangling spatial and temporal
trajectory parameters and design an efficient framework that directly operates
on the INRs' parameter space to classify brain aging trajectories. To evaluate
our method in a controlled data environment, we develop a biologically grounded
trajectory simulation and generate T1-weighted 3D MRI data for 450 healthy and
dementia-like subjects at regularly and irregularly sampled timepoints. In the
more realistic irregular sampling experiment, our INR-based method achieves
81.3% accuracy for the brain aging trajectory classification task,
outperforming a standard deep learning baseline model (73.7%).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A human-in-the-loop interactive framework that uses targeted human corrections to improve segmentation models by identifying and correcting reliance on spurious correlations, leading to more robust and generalizable representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmentation models often fail in real-world domains by relying on spurious correlations rather than true object boundaries, limiting their practical applicability.

Method: Interactive framework using human corrections as interventional signals to identify when models rely on superficial features, then propagating correction-informed edits across visually similar images to steer models toward robust semantic features.

Result: Improves segmentation accuracy by up to 9 mIoU points (12-15% relative improvement) on challenging cubemap data, with 3-4x reductions in annotation effort compared to standard retraining while maintaining competitive benchmark performance.

Conclusion: Provides a practical framework for building accurate, robust, data-efficient segmentation systems that adapt well to real-world domains like urban climate monitoring and autonomous driving.

Abstract: Segmentation models achieve high accuracy on benchmarks but often fail in
real-world domains by relying on spurious correlations instead of true object
boundaries. We propose a human-in-the-loop interactive framework that enables
interventional learning through targeted human corrections of segmentation
outputs. Our approach treats human corrections as interventional signals that
show when reliance on superficial features (e.g., color or texture) is
inappropriate. The system learns from these interventions by propagating
correction-informed edits across visually similar images, effectively steering
the model toward robust, semantically meaningful features rather than
dataset-specific artifacts. Unlike traditional annotation approaches that
simply provide more training data, our method explicitly identifies when and
why the model fails and then systematically corrects these failure modes across
the entire dataset. Through iterative human feedback, the system develops
increasingly robust representations that generalize better to novel domains and
resist artifactual correlations. We demonstrate that our framework improves
segmentation accuracy by up to 9 mIoU points (12-15\% relative improvement) on
challenging cubemap data and yields 3-4$\times$ reductions in annotation effort
compared to standard retraining, while maintaining competitive performance on
benchmark datasets. This work provides a practical framework for researchers
and practitioners seeking to build segmentation systems that are accurate,
robust to dataset biases, data-efficient, and adaptable to real-world domains
such as urban climate monitoring and autonomous driving.

*Pan Wang,Yihao Hu,Xiaodong Bai,Aiping Yang,Xiangxiang Li,Meiping Ding,Jianguo Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-strategy framework for automated Shatian pomelo detection that addresses key challenges including imaging device variations, lighting conditions, object scale variation, and occlusion through a specialized REAS-Det network and comprehensive dataset construction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shatian pomelo as a specialty agricultural product requires automated detection for accurate quantity assessment and lean production, but existing methods degrade in real-world conditions due to four key challenges: imaging devices, lighting conditions, object scale variation, and occlusion.

Method: Proposed a multi-strategy framework including: 1) STP-AgriData multi-scenario dataset combining real orchard and internet-sourced data, 2) Data augmentations for illumination variations, 3) REAS-Det network with RFAConv and C3RFEM modules for scale variation, and MultiSEAM structure with soft-NMS for occlusion handling.

Result: Achieved precision of 87.6%, recall of 74.9%, mAP@.50 of 82.8%, and mAP@.50:.95 of 53.3%, demonstrating superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art detection methods.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-strategy framework effectively addresses the key challenges in real-world Shatian pomelo detection and shows promising results for automated agricultural product detection applications.

Abstract: As a specialty agricultural product with a large market scale, Shatian pomelo
necessitates the adoption of automated detection to ensure accurate quantity
and meet commercial demands for lean production. Existing research often
involves specialized networks tailored for specific theoretical or dataset
scenarios, but these methods tend to degrade performance in real-world. Through
analysis of factors in this issue, this study identifies four key challenges
that affect the accuracy of Shatian pomelo detection: imaging devices, lighting
conditions, object scale variation, and occlusion. To mitigate these
challenges, a multi-strategy framework is proposed in this paper. Firstly, to
effectively solve tone variation introduced by diverse imaging devices and
complex orchard environments, we utilize a multi-scenario dataset,
STP-AgriData, which is constructed by integrating real orchard images with
internet-sourced data. Secondly, to simulate the inconsistent illumination
conditions, specific data augmentations such as adjusting contrast and changing
brightness, are applied to the above dataset. Thirdly, to address the issues of
object scale variation and occlusion in fruit detection, an REAS-Det network is
designed in this paper. For scale variation, RFAConv and C3RFEM modules are
designed to expand and enhance the receptive fields. For occlusion variation, a
multi-scale, multi-head feature selection structure (MultiSEAM) and soft-NMS
are introduced to enhance the handling of occlusion issues to improve detection
accuracy. The results of these experiments achieved a precision(P) of 87.6%, a
recall (R) of 74.9%, a mAP@.50 of 82.8%, and a mAP@.50:.95 of 53.3%. Our
proposed network demonstrates superior performance compared to other
state-of-the-art detection methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: J-RAS is a joint training method that combines segmentation and retrieval models to improve medical image segmentation by leveraging retrieved image-mask pairs for better anatomical understanding and boundary delineation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual medical image segmentation is time-consuming and variable, while AI methods require large annotated datasets and struggle with generalization across diverse imaging conditions and rare pathologies.

Method: Joint training of segmentation and retrieval models where both are optimized together - the segmentation model uses retrieved image-mask pairs for anatomical context, while the retrieval model learns segmentation-relevant features beyond visual similarity.

Result: Substantial improvements across multiple architectures: On ACDC dataset, SegFormer with J-RAS improved mean Dice score from 0.8708±0.042 to 0.9115±0.031 and reduced mean Hausdorff Distance from 1.8130±2.49 to 1.1489±0.30.

Conclusion: J-RAS effectively enhances segmentation performance by enabling retrieval to provide meaningful contextual cues, demonstrating strong generalizability across different architectures and datasets.

Abstract: Image segmentation, the process of dividing images into meaningful regions,
is critical in medical applications for accurate diagnosis, treatment planning,
and disease monitoring. Although manual segmentation by healthcare
professionals produces precise outcomes, it is time-consuming, costly, and
prone to variability due to differences in human expertise. Artificial
intelligence (AI)-based methods have been developed to address these
limitations by automating segmentation tasks; however, they often require
large, annotated datasets that are rarely available in practice and frequently
struggle to generalize across diverse imaging conditions due to inter-patient
variability and rare pathological cases. In this paper, we propose Joint
Retrieval Augmented Segmentation (J-RAS), a joint training method for guided
image segmentation that integrates a segmentation model with a retrieval model.
Both models are jointly optimized, enabling the segmentation model to leverage
retrieved image-mask pairs to enrich its anatomical understanding, while the
retrieval model learns segmentation-relevant features beyond simple visual
similarity. This joint optimization ensures that retrieval actively contributes
meaningful contextual cues to guide boundary delineation, thereby enhancing the
overall segmentation performance. We validate J-RAS across multiple
segmentation backbones, including U-Net, TransUNet, SAM, and SegFormer, on two
benchmark datasets: ACDC and M&Ms, demonstrating consistent improvements. For
example, on the ACDC dataset, SegFormer without J-RAS achieves a mean Dice
score of 0.8708$\pm$0.042 and a mean Hausdorff Distance (HD) of
1.8130$\pm$2.49, whereas with J-RAS, the performance improves substantially to
a mean Dice score of 0.9115$\pm$0.031 and a mean HD of 1.1489$\pm$0.30. These
results highlight the method's effectiveness and its generalizability across
architectures and datasets.

*Fan Zuo,Donglin Zhou,Jingqin Gao,Kaan Ozbay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An AI framework using traffic cameras and YOLOv11 for large-scale traffic monitoring, validated on NYC congestion pricing rollout showing 9% vehicle reduction and increased pedestrian/cyclist activity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for cost-effective traffic monitoring during disruptions like congestion pricing, as traditional sensors are expensive and existing video analytics struggle with dynamic viewpoints and large data volumes.

Method: End-to-end AI framework with fine-tuned YOLOv11 for traffic detection, graph-based viewpoint normalization for camera consistency, and domain-specific LLM for automated traffic pattern summaries from 24/7 video streams.

Result: Validated on 9M+ images from 1,000 NYC cameras: 9% weekday passenger vehicle decline in congestion zone, early truck reductions with rebound signs, increased pedestrian/cyclist activity. LLM accuracy improved with example-based prompts.

Conclusion: Framework provides practical, infrastructure-ready solution for large-scale policy-relevant traffic monitoring with minimal human intervention.

Abstract: Accurate, scalable traffic monitoring is critical for real-time and long-term
transportation management, particularly during disruptions such as natural
disasters, large construction projects, or major policy changes like New York
City's first-in-the-nation congestion pricing program. However, widespread
sensor deployment remains limited due to high installation, maintenance, and
data management costs. While traffic cameras offer a cost-effective
alternative, existing video analytics struggle with dynamic camera viewpoints
and massive data volumes from large camera networks. This study presents an
end-to-end AI-based framework leveraging existing traffic camera infrastructure
for high-resolution, longitudinal analysis at scale. A fine-tuned YOLOv11
model, trained on localized urban scenes, extracts multimodal traffic density
and classification metrics in real time. To address inconsistencies from
non-stationary pan-tilt-zoom cameras, we introduce a novel graph-based
viewpoint normalization method. A domain-specific large language model was also
integrated to process massive data from a 24/7 video stream to generate
frequent, automated summaries of evolving traffic patterns, a task far
exceeding manual capabilities. We validated the system using over 9 million
images from roughly 1,000 traffic cameras during the early rollout of NYC
congestion pricing in 2025. Results show a 9% decline in weekday passenger
vehicle density within the Congestion Relief Zone, early truck volume
reductions with signs of rebound, and consistent increases in pedestrian and
cyclist activity at corridor and zonal scales. Experiments showed that
example-based prompts improved LLM's numerical accuracy and reduced
hallucinations. These findings demonstrate the framework's potential as a
practical, infrastructure-ready solution for large-scale, policy-relevant
traffic monitoring with minimal human intervention.

### [29] [FlareX: A Physics-Informed Dataset for Lens Flare Removal via 2D Synthesis and 3D Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09995)
*Lishen Qu,Zhihao Liu,Jinshan Pan,Shihao Zhou,Jinglei Shi,Duosheng Chen,Jufeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes FlareX, a physics-informed flare dataset generation method combining 2D synthesis and 3D rendering to address limitations of existing synthetic flare datasets that fail to generalize to real-world scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flare datasets use artificial templates that lack diversity and ignore physical principles, causing poor generalization to real-world images. Real-world flare-free and flare-corrupted image pairs are difficult to capture.

Method: Three-stage physics-informed generation: parameterized template creation, illumination-aware 2D synthesis, and physical engine-based 3D rendering. Creates FlareX dataset with 9,500 2D templates and 3,000 3D-rendered flare pairs. Uses masking to obtain real-world flare-free images for evaluation.

Result: Created FlareX dataset with substantial scale and diversity - 9,500 2D templates from 95 patterns and 3,000 image pairs from 60 3D scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness of the method and dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed physics-informed flare generation method and FlareX dataset successfully address limitations of existing synthetic approaches, enabling better generalization to real-world flare removal scenarios through improved flare diversity and physical accuracy.

Abstract: Lens flare occurs when shooting towards strong light sources, significantly
degrading the visual quality of images. Due to the difficulty in capturing
flare-corrupted and flare-free image pairs in the real world, existing datasets
are typically synthesized in 2D by overlaying artificial flare templates onto
background images. However, the lack of flare diversity in templates and the
neglect of physical principles in the synthesis process hinder models trained
on these datasets from generalizing well to real-world scenarios. To address
these challenges, we propose a new physics-informed method for flare data
generation, which consists of three stages: parameterized template creation,
the laws of illumination-aware 2D synthesis, and physical engine-based 3D
rendering, which finally gives us a mixed flare dataset that incorporates both
2D and 3D perspectives, namely FlareX. This dataset offers 9,500 2D templates
derived from 95 flare patterns and 3,000 flare image pairs rendered from 60 3D
scenes. Furthermore, we design a masking approach to obtain real-world
flare-free images from their corrupted counterparts to measure the performance
of the model on real-world images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method and dataset.

### [30] [BurstDeflicker: A Benchmark Dataset for Flicker Removal in Dynamic Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09996)
*Lishen Qu,Zhihao Liu,Shihao Zhou,Yaqi Luo,Jie Liang,Hui Zeng,Lei Zhang,Jufeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces BurstDeflicker, a scalable benchmark for flicker removal in images caused by AC-powered lighting and rolling shutter cameras, using three data acquisition strategies: Retinex-based synthesis, real-world capture, and green-screen method for dynamic scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flicker artifacts from AC lighting and rolling shutter cameras degrade image quality and affect high-level computer vision tasks, but research has been hindered by the lack of large-scale, realistic datasets.

Method: Three complementary data acquisition strategies: 1) Retinex-based synthesis pipeline for controllable flicker manipulation, 2) 4,000 real-world flicker images from different scenes, 3) Green-screen method to incorporate motion while preserving real flicker degradation.

Result: Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the BurstDeflicker dataset in advancing flicker removal research.

Conclusion: The proposed BurstDeflicker benchmark addresses the critical gap in flicker removal research by providing a scalable, diverse dataset that enables better understanding of flicker characteristics and improves generalization to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Flicker artifacts in short-exposure images are caused by the interplay
between the row-wise exposure mechanism of rolling shutter cameras and the
temporal intensity variations of alternating current (AC)-powered lighting.
These artifacts typically appear as uneven brightness distribution across the
image, forming noticeable dark bands. Beyond compromising image quality, this
structured noise also affects high-level tasks, such as object detection and
tracking, where reliable lighting is crucial. Despite the prevalence of
flicker, the lack of a large-scale, realistic dataset has been a significant
barrier to advancing research in flicker removal. To address this issue, we
present BurstDeflicker, a scalable benchmark constructed using three
complementary data acquisition strategies. First, we develop a Retinex-based
synthesis pipeline that redefines the goal of flicker removal and enables
controllable manipulation of key flicker-related attributes (e.g., intensity,
area, and frequency), thereby facilitating the generation of diverse flicker
patterns. Second, we capture 4,000 real-world flicker images from different
scenes, which help the model better understand the spatial and temporal
characteristics of real flicker artifacts and generalize more effectively to
wild scenarios. Finally, due to the non-repeatable nature of dynamic scenes, we
propose a green-screen method to incorporate motion into image pairs while
preserving real flicker degradation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our dataset and its potential to advance research in flicker
removal.

*Yanyuan Chen,Dexuan Xu,Yu Huang,Songkun Zhan,Hanpin Wang,Dongxue Chen,Xueping Wang,Meikang Qiu,Hang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIMO is a unified medical vision language model that addresses limitations of existing models by incorporating visual referring multimodal input and pixel grounding multimodal output, enabling better understanding of medical images and grounding medical terminologies in images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical vision language models have two key limitations: they only use text instructions without direct visual understanding, and they only provide text answers without connecting to key image areas. This hinders comprehensive medical image analysis.

Method: Proposed MIMO model with visual referring multimodal input and pixel grounding multimodal output. Created MIMOSeg dataset with 895K samples covering basic instruction following and complex question answering with multimodal input/output. Conducted experiments on multiple medical multimodal tasks.

Result: Extensive experiments verified that MIMO uniquely combines visual referring and pixel grounding capabilities, which previous models lacked. The model can effectively understand complex medical images and ground medical terminologies within images.

Conclusion: MIMO successfully addresses the limitations of existing medical vision language models by providing unified multimodal input and output capabilities, enabling more comprehensive medical image understanding and analysis through visual referring and pixel grounding.

Abstract: Currently, medical vision language models are widely used in medical vision
question answering tasks. However, existing models are confronted with two
issues: for input, the model only relies on text instructions and lacks direct
understanding of visual clues in the image; for output, the model only gives
text answers and lacks connection with key areas in the image. To address these
issues, we propose a unified medical vision language model MIMO, with visual
referring Multimodal Input and pixel grounding Multimodal Output. MIMO can not
only combine visual clues and textual instructions to understand complex
medical images and semantics, but can also ground medical terminologies in
textual output within the image. To overcome the scarcity of relevant data in
the medical field, we propose MIMOSeg, a comprehensive medical multimodal
dataset including 895K samples. MIMOSeg is constructed from four different
perspectives, covering basic instruction following and complex question
answering with multimodal input and multimodal output. We conduct experiments
on several downstream medical multimodal tasks. Extensive experimental results
verify that MIMO can uniquely combine visual referring and pixel grounding
capabilities, which are not available in previous models.

### [32] [Q-Adapter: Visual Query Adapter for Extracting Textually-related Features in Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10022)
*Junan Chen,Trung Thanh Nguyen,Takahiro Komamizu,Ichiro Ide*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Adapter is a lightweight visual adapter module that enables parameter-efficient fine-tuning for video captioning, achieving state-of-the-art performance with only 1.4% of parameters compared to full fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard full fine-tuning of large pretrained models for video captioning is computationally prohibitive, and existing PEFT methods primarily focus on language components while lacking sufficient understanding of visual information during multimodal fine-tuning.

Method: Q-Adapter introduces learnable query tokens and a gating layer into the Vision Encoder to extract sparse, caption-relevant features without external textual supervision, enabling efficient fine-tuning for video captioning tasks.

Result: Q-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance among PEFT methods on MSR-VTT and MSVD datasets across BLEU@4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr metrics, and competitive performance compared to full fine-tuning approaches while using only 1.4% of parameters.

Conclusion: Q-Adapter demonstrates strong potential in balancing caption quality and parameter efficiency, offering scalability for video-language modeling through adapter-based learning with optimized hyperparameters and design choices.

Abstract: Recent advances in video captioning are driven by large-scale pretrained
models, which follow the standard "pre-training followed by fine-tuning"
paradigm, where the full model is fine-tuned for downstream tasks. Although
effective, this approach becomes computationally prohibitive as the model size
increases. The Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approach offers a
promising alternative, but primarily focuses on the language components of
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Despite recent progress, PEFT remains
underexplored in multimodal tasks and lacks sufficient understanding of visual
information during fine-tuning the model. To bridge this gap, we propose
Query-Adapter (Q-Adapter), a lightweight visual adapter module designed to
enhance MLLMs by enabling efficient fine-tuning for the video captioning task.
Q-Adapter introduces learnable query tokens and a gating layer into Vision
Encoder, enabling effective extraction of sparse, caption-relevant features
without relying on external textual supervision. We evaluate Q-Adapter on two
well-known video captioning datasets, MSR-VTT and MSVD, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance among the methods that take the PEFT approach
across BLEU@4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr metrics. Q-Adapter also achieves
competitive performance compared to methods that take the full fine-tuning
approach while requiring only 1.4% of the parameters. We further analyze the
impact of key hyperparameters and design choices on fine-tuning effectiveness,
providing insights into optimization strategies for adapter-based learning.
These results highlight the strong potential of Q-Adapter in balancing caption
quality and parameter efficiency, demonstrating its scalability for
video-language modeling.

*Henan Wang,Hanxin Zhu,Xinliang Gong,Tianyu He,Xin Li,Zhibo Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: P-4DGS is a novel dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting representation that achieves superior compression for 4D scene modeling, reducing memory consumption by exploiting spatial-temporal redundancies through prediction, quantization, and entropy coding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dynamic 3DGS algorithms overlook substantial temporal and spatial redundancies in dynamic scenes, leading to prohibitive memory consumption that limits practical applications.

Method: Uses 3D anchor point-based spatial-temporal prediction inspired by video compression techniques, combined with adaptive quantization and context-based entropy coding to compress dynamic 3D Gaussian representations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality with fastest rendering speed and remarkably low storage (around 1MB), achieving 40× compression on synthetic scenes and 90× compression on real-world scenes.

Conclusion: P-4DGS provides an efficient solution for compact 4D scene modeling that significantly reduces memory footprint while maintaining high reconstruction quality and real-time rendering performance.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered significant attention due to its
superior scene representation fidelity and real-time rendering performance,
especially for dynamic 3D scene reconstruction (\textit{i.e.}, 4D
reconstruction). However, despite achieving promising results, most existing
algorithms overlook the substantial temporal and spatial redundancies inherent
in dynamic scenes, leading to prohibitive memory consumption. To address this,
we propose P-4DGS, a novel dynamic 3DGS representation for compact 4D scene
modeling. Inspired by intra- and inter-frame prediction techniques commonly
used in video compression, we first design a 3D anchor point-based
spatial-temporal prediction module to fully exploit the spatial-temporal
correlations across different 3D Gaussian primitives. Subsequently, we employ
an adaptive quantization strategy combined with context-based entropy coding to
further reduce the size of the 3D anchor points, thereby achieving enhanced
compression efficiency. To evaluate the rate-distortion performance of our
proposed P-4DGS in comparison with other dynamic 3DGS representations, we
conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
reconstruction quality and the fastest rendering speed, with a remarkably low
storage footprint (around \textbf{1MB} on average), achieving up to
\textbf{40$\times$} and \textbf{90$\times$} compression on synthetic and
real-world scenes, respectively.

*Sitong Gong,Yunzhi Zhuge,Lu Zhang,Pingping Zhang,Huchuan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CCFormer is a novel Transformer-based framework for Audio-Visual Segmentation that enhances cross-modal complementarity through parallel bilateral architecture, multi-query transformers for spatial-temporal modeling, and bi-modal contrastive learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods have limitations: CNN-based approaches are restricted by local receptive fields, while Transformer-based methods struggle with extracting multimodal coefficients and temporal dynamics effectively. There's a need for better handling of both local/global information and spatial-temporal context in audio-visual segmentation.

Method: CCFormer framework with three key components: 1) Early Integration Module (EIM) using parallel bilateral architecture to merge multi-scale visual features with audio data; 2) Multi-query Transformer Module (MTM) that dynamically enables audio queries to learn and models frame/video-level relations; 3) Bi-modal Contrastive Learning (BCL) to align modalities in unified feature space.

Result: The method achieves new state-of-the-art benchmarks across S4, MS3 and AVSS datasets, demonstrating superior performance in audio-visual segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: CCFormer effectively addresses limitations of previous methods by comprehensively capturing spatial-temporal context and enhancing cross-modal complementarity through its integrated design of early fusion, multi-query transformers, and contrastive learning.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to generate pixel-wise segmentation maps
that correlate with the auditory signals of objects. This field has seen
significant progress with numerous CNN and Transformer-based methods enhancing
the segmentation accuracy and robustness. Traditional CNN approaches manage
audio-visual interactions through basic operations like padding and
multiplications but are restricted by CNNs' limited local receptive field. More
recently, Transformer-based methods treat auditory cues as queries, utilizing
attention mechanisms to enhance audio-visual cooperation within frames.
Nevertheless, they typically struggle to extract multimodal coefficients and
temporal dynamics adequately. To overcome these limitations, we present the
Complementary and Contrastive Transformer (CCFormer), a novel framework adept
at processing both local and global information and capturing spatial-temporal
context comprehensively. Our CCFormer initiates with the Early Integration
Module (EIM) that employs a parallel bilateral architecture, merging
multi-scale visual features with audio data to boost cross-modal
complementarity. To extract the intra-frame spatial features and facilitate the
perception of temporal coherence, we introduce the Multi-query Transformer
Module (MTM), which dynamically endows audio queries with learning capabilities
and models the frame and video-level relations simultaneously. Furthermore, we
propose the Bi-modal Contrastive Learning (BCL) to promote the alignment across
both modalities in the unified feature space. Through the effective combination
of those designs, our method sets new state-of-the-art benchmarks across the
S4, MS3 and AVSS datasets. Our source code and model weights will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/SitongGong/CCFormer

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViTAR is a medical vision-language model that mimics human expert diagnostic reasoning through iterative "think-act-rethink-answer" cycles, outperforming state-of-the-art models by focusing on clinically relevant regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical VLMs use single-pass reasoning that ignores localized visual cues, unlike human experts who iteratively scan and refine regions of interest before diagnosis.

Method: ViTAR uses a cognitive chain of "think-act-rethink-answer" to treat medical images as interactive objects. It employs a two-stage training: supervised fine-tuning to guide cognitive trajectories, followed by reinforcement learning to optimize decision-making, supported by curated datasets (1K interactive examples and 16K VQA data).

Result: ViTAR outperforms strong state-of-the-art models. Visual attention analysis shows it increasingly anchors to clinically critical regions from "think" to "rethink" rounds and maintains high attention to visual tokens during reasoning.

Conclusion: Embedding expert-style iterative thinking chains into VLMs enhances both performance and trustworthiness of medical AI by providing mechanistic insights into improved diagnostic reasoning.

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) excel at image-text understanding but
typically rely on a single-pass reasoning that neglects localized visual cues.
In clinical practice, however, human experts iteratively scan, focus, and
refine the regions of interest before reaching a final diagnosis. To narrow
this machine-human perception gap, we introduce ViTAR, a novel VLM framework
that emulates the iterative reasoning process of human experts through a
cognitive chain of "think-act-rethink-answer". ViTAR treats medical images as
interactive objects, enabling models to engage multi-step visual reasoning. To
support this approach, we curate a high-quality instruction dataset comprising
1K interactive examples that encode expert-like diagnostic behaviors. In
addition, a 16K visual question answering training data has been curated
towards fine-grained visual diagnosis. We introduce a two-stage training
strategy that begins with supervised fine-tuning to guide cognitive
trajectories, followed by the reinforcement learning to optimize
decision-making. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ViTAR outperforms
strong state-of-the-art models. Visual attention analysis reveals that from the
"think" to "rethink" rounds, ViTAR increasingly anchors visual grounding to
clinically critical regions and maintains high attention allocation to visual
tokens during reasoning, providing mechanistic insight into its improved
performance. These findings demonstrate that embedding expert-style iterative
thinking chains into VLMs enhances both performance and trustworthiness of
medical AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While deepfake detection has been widely studied, the subjective perception and computational modeling of deepfake visual realism lacks adequate research. This is important for evaluating deepfake quality, deceptiveness, and potential impact on society.

Method: Created the DREAM benchmark comprising: 1) diverse deepfake video dataset, 2) 140,000 realism scores and textual descriptions from 3,500 human annotators, 3) evaluation of 16 realism assessment methods including large vision language models and a novel description-aligned CLIP method.

Result: The study provides a comprehensive foundation for deepfake realism assessment research, including benchmark dataset, human annotations, and comparative analysis of various assessment approaches.

Conclusion: The DREAM benchmark establishes a foundation for future research in deepfake visual realism assessment and related areas, addressing the gap in computational modeling of subjective deepfake perception.

Abstract: Deep learning based face-swap videos, widely known as deepfakes, have drawn
wide attention due to their threat to information credibility. Recent works
mainly focus on the problem of deepfake detection that aims to reliably tell
deepfakes apart from real ones, in an objective way. On the other hand, the
subjective perception of deepfakes, especially its computational modeling and
imitation, is also a significant problem but lacks adequate study. In this
paper, we focus on the visual realism assessment of deepfakes, which is defined
as the automatic assessment of deepfake visual realism that approximates human
perception of deepfakes. It is important for evaluating the quality and
deceptiveness of deepfakes which can be used for predicting the influence of
deepfakes on Internet, and it also has potentials in improving the deepfake
generation process by serving as a critic. This paper prompts this new
direction by presenting a comprehensive benchmark called DREAM, which stands
for Deepfake REalism AssessMent. It is comprised of a deepfake video dataset of
diverse quality, a large scale annotation that includes 140,000 realism scores
and textual descriptions obtained from 3,500 human annotators, and a
comprehensive evaluation and analysis of 16 representative realism assessment
methods, including recent large vision language model based methods and a newly
proposed description-aligned CLIP method. The benchmark and insights included
in this study can lay the foundation for future research in this direction and
other related areas.

TL;DR: CLSL is a collaborative learning framework that simultaneously addresses semantic-aware feature learning and missing label recovery for multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels faces two core challenges: semantic-aware feature learning and missing label recovery, which need to be addressed in a unified manner.

Method: Proposes CLSL with three modules: semantic-related feature learning to discover semantic information and label correlations, semantic-guided feature enhancement to align visual and semantic features, and a collaborative learning framework that integrates feature learning and label recovery in a mutually reinforced loop.

Result: Extensive experiments on MS-COCO, VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE datasets demonstrate that CLSL outperforms state-of-the-art methods for multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels.

Conclusion: The collaborative learning framework effectively addresses both semantic-aware feature learning and missing label recovery, forming a mutually beneficial relationship that improves multi-label image recognition performance with incomplete labels.

Abstract: Multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels is a critical learning
task and has emerged as a focal topic in computer vision. However, this task is
confronted with two core challenges: semantic-aware feature learning and
missing label recovery. In this paper, we propose a novel Collaborative
Learning of Semantic-aware feature learning and Label recovery (CLSL) method
for multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels, which unifies the two
aforementioned challenges into a unified learning framework. More specifically,
we design a semantic-related feature learning module to learn robust
semantic-related features by discovering semantic information and label
correlations. Then, a semantic-guided feature enhancement module is proposed to
generate high-quality discriminative semantic-aware features by effectively
aligning visual and semantic feature spaces. Finally, we introduce a
collaborative learning framework that integrates semantic-aware feature
learning and label recovery, which can not only dynamically enhance the
discriminability of semantic-aware features but also adaptively infer and
recover missing labels, forming a mutually reinforced loop between the two
processes. Extensive experiments on three widely used public datasets (MS-COCO,
VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE) demonstrate that CLSL outperforms the state-of-the-art
multi-label image recognition methods with incomplete labels.

*Pîrvu Mihai-Cristian,Leordeanu Marius*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHG-MAE is a novel model that combines neural graphs with masked autoencoders, enabling probabilistic hyper-graph sampling through modality masking and unifying pre-training/fine-tuning in one training loop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for self-supervised pre-training without manual labels and unify classical neural graphs with modern masked autoencoders under a common theoretical framework.

Method: Uses random masking of entire modalities (not just patches) to sample from hyper-edge distributions, combines pre-training and fine-tuning in a single training loop, and enables inference-time ensembles with knowledge distillation.

Result: The approach boosts prediction performance and consistency through ensemble aggregation, and enables effective knowledge distillation even with models under 1M parameters.

Conclusion: PHG-MAE provides a unified framework for multi-modal learning applicable to domains like UAV scenes, autonomous driving, and indoor robotics, with publicly released code and an extended Dronescapes dataset.

Abstract: The computer vision domain has greatly benefited from an abundance of data
across many modalities to improve on various visual tasks. Recently, there has
been a lot of focus on self-supervised pre-training methods through Masked
Autoencoders (MAE) \cite{he2022masked,bachmann2022multimae}, usually used as a
first step before optimizing for a downstream task, such as classification or
regression. This is very useful as it doesn't require any manually labeled
data. In this work, we introduce Probabilistic Hyper-Graphs using Masked
Autoencoders (PHG-MAE): a novel model that unifies the classical work on neural
graphs \cite{leordeanu2021semi} with the modern approach of masked autoencoders
under a common theoretical framework. Through random masking of entire
modalities, not just patches, the model samples from the distribution of
hyper-edges on each forward pass. Additionally, the model adapts the standard
MAE algorithm by combining pre-training and fine-tuning into a single training
loop. Moreover, our approach enables the creation of inference-time ensembles
which, through aggregation, boost the final prediction performance and
consistency. Lastly, we show that we can apply knowledge distillation on top of
the ensembles with little loss in performance, even with models that have fewer
than 1M parameters. While our work mostly focuses on outdoor UAV scenes that
contain multiple world interpretations and modalities, the same steps can be
followed in other similar domains, such as autonomous driving or indoor
robotics. In order to streamline the process of integrating external
pre-trained experts for computer vision multi-modal multi-task learning (MTL)
scenarios, we developed a data-pipeline software. Using this tool, we have
created and released a fully-automated extension of the Dronescapes dataset.
All the technical details, code and reproduction steps are publicly released.

*Meijun Zhou,Gang Mei,Zhengjing Ma,Nengxiong Xu,Jianbing Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework using vision foundation models to track spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars by converting discrete optical remote sensing images into continuous video sequences for continuous monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing landslide studies focus on single-phase or pre/post-failure dual-phase identification, making it challenging to track the continuous spatiotemporal evolution of landslide scars needed for understanding failure mechanisms and early warning.

Method: Proposes a framework that reconstructs discrete optical remote sensing images into continuous video sequences, enabling vision foundation models developed for video segmentation to track landslide scar evolution through knowledge-guided auto-propagation and interactive refinement.

Result: Validated on Baige and Sela landslides (2017-2025), the framework successfully enables continuous tracking of landslide scars, capturing both failure precursors for early warning and post-failure evolution for secondary hazard assessment.

Conclusion: The proposed universal framework effectively addresses the limitation of existing methods by enabling continuous spatiotemporal tracking of landslide scars, providing critical insights for early warning systems and long-term stability assessment.

Abstract: Tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars is
critical for understanding the evolution mechanisms and failure precursors,
enabling effective early-warning. However, most existing studies have focused
on single-phase or pre- and post-failure dual-phase landslide identification.
Although these approaches delineate post-failure landslide boundaries, it is
challenging to track the spatiotemporal evolution of landslide scars. To
address this problem, this study proposes a novel and universal framework for
tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars using a
vision foundation model. The key idea behind the proposed framework is to
reconstruct discrete optical remote sensing images into a continuous video
sequence. This transformation enables a vision foundation model, which is
developed for video segmentation, to be used for tracking the evolution of
landslide scars. The proposed framework operates within a knowledge-guided,
auto-propagation, and interactive refinement paradigm to ensure the continuous
and accurate identification of landslide scars. The proposed framework was
validated through application to two representative cases: the post-failure
Baige landslide and the active Sela landslide (2017-2025). Results indicate
that the proposed framework enables continuous tracking of landslide scars,
capturing both failure precursors critical for early warning and post-failure
evolution essential for assessing secondary hazards and long-term stability.

*Jiahui Lu,Haihong Xiao,Xueyan Zhao,Wenxiong Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gesplat is a 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that enables robust novel view synthesis and geometrically consistent reconstruction from unposed sparse images, overcoming limitations of traditional methods that require accurate camera poses and dense viewpoint coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF and 3DGS methods heavily depend on accurate camera poses and dense viewpoint coverage, limiting their applicability in sparse-view settings where pose estimation becomes unreliable and supervision is insufficient.

Method: Leverages VGGT foundation model for reliable initial poses and dense point clouds; uses hybrid Gaussian representation with dual position-shape optimization enhanced by inter-view matching consistency; includes graph-guided attribute refinement module and flow-based depth regularization.

Result: Achieves more robust performance on both forward-facing and large-scale complex datasets compared to other pose-free methods, as demonstrated through comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments.

Conclusion: Gesplat successfully enables robust novel view synthesis and geometrically consistent reconstruction from unposed sparse images, addressing key limitations of existing 3D reconstruction methods.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have advanced
3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis, but remain heavily dependent on
accurate camera poses and dense viewpoint coverage. These requirements limit
their applicability in sparse-view settings, where pose estimation becomes
unreliable and supervision is insufficient. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce Gesplat, a 3DGS-based framework that enables robust novel view
synthesis and geometrically consistent reconstruction from unposed sparse
images. Unlike prior works that rely on COLMAP for sparse point cloud
initialization, we leverage the VGGT foundation model to obtain more reliable
initial poses and dense point clouds. Our approach integrates several key
innovations: 1) a hybrid Gaussian representation with dual position-shape
optimization enhanced by inter-view matching consistency; 2) a graph-guided
attribute refinement module to enhance scene details; and 3) flow-based depth
regularization that improves depth estimation accuracy for more effective
supervision. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves more robust performance on both forward-facing and
large-scale complex datasets compared to other pose-free methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedCoPL extends Unsupervised Federated Learning to classification tasks using CLIP, addressing global class imbalance through pseudo label distribution adjustment and enabling effective collaboration via partial prompt aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage vision language models like CLIP for classification problems in Unsupervised Federated Learning, which were previously infeasible but now present promising opportunities due to CLIP's zero-shot capabilities.

Method: FedCoPL involves clients estimating and uploading pseudo label distributions, server adjusting and redistributing them to avoid global class imbalance, and implementing partial prompt aggregation where visual prompts are aggregated at server while text prompts remain local for personalization.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: FedCoPL successfully enables classification in Unsupervised Federated Learning using CLIP, providing an effective solution for collaborative training without data sharing or label access.

Abstract: Unsupervised Federated Learning (UFL) aims to collaboratively train a global
model across distributed clients without sharing data or accessing label
information. Previous UFL works have predominantly focused on representation
learning and clustering tasks. Recently, vision language models (e.g., CLIP)
have gained significant attention for their powerful zero-shot prediction
capabilities. Leveraging this advancement, classification problems that were
previously infeasible under the UFL paradigm now present promising new
opportunities, yet remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we extend UFL to
the classification problem with CLIP for the first time and propose a novel
method, \underline{\textbf{Fed}}erated \underline{\textbf{Co}}operative
\underline{\textbf{P}}seudo \underline{\textbf{L}}abeling (\textbf{FedCoPL}).
Specifically, clients estimate and upload their pseudo label distribution, and
the server adjusts and redistributes them to avoid global imbalance among
classes. Moreover, we introduce a partial prompt aggregation protocol for
effective collaboration and personalization. In particular, visual prompts
containing general image features are aggregated at the server, while text
prompts encoding personalized knowledge are retained locally. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FedCoPL compared to
baseline methods. Our code is available at

### [42] [Answer-Consistent Chain-of-thought Reinforcement Learning For Multi-modal Large Langauge Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10104)
*Minbin Huang,Runhui Huang,Chuanyang Zheng,Jingyao Li,Guoxuan Chen,Han Shi,Hong Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes ACRE (Answer-Consistent Reinforcement Learning), a modified version of GRPO that adds a consistency check between reasoning steps and final answers to prevent reasoning-answer mismatches in multimodal LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RLVR methods improve answer accuracy but can create inconsistency between reasoning chains and final answers, with experiments showing only 79.7% consistency on MMVU tasks between reasoning steps and chosen answers.

Method: ACRE modifies GRPO with an auxiliary consistency check: after generating chain-of-thought and initial answer, the model is prompted again with shuffled answer options and same reasoning trace to predict a second answer, with rewards based on consistency and correctness.

Result: ACRE achieves average improvements of 2.2% on Video Reasoning benchmarks and 1.5% on multimodal math reasoning benchmarks over the GRPO baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed ACRE method effectively addresses reasoning-answer misalignment in multimodal LLMs by enforcing consistency between reasoning traces and final answers through a novel reward mechanism.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can significantly enhance
reasoning abilities by directly optimizing correctness, rather than relying
solely on supervised imitation. This paradigm has been extended to multimodal
LLMs for complex video and image understanding tasks. However, while
outcome-driven RL improves answer accuracy, it can inadvertently decouple the
reasoning chain from the final answer, leading to situations where models
produce inconsistency between the reasoning trace and final answer. In our
experiments on multiple-choice visual question-answering tasks, the standard
GRPO method yields only 79.7\% consistency on MMVU between the reasoning steps
and the chosen answers, indicating frequent mismatches between answers and
reasoning. To this end, we propose Answer-Consistent Reinforcement Learning
(ACRE) that modifies the GRPO algorithm with an auxiliary consistency check.
After the model generates a chain of thought and an initial answer for a given
question, we shuffle the answer options and prompt the model again with the
same reasoning trace to predict a second answer. We design a
consistency-verification reward that grants a high reward only if both the
original and the post-shuffle answers agree and are correct; otherwise, a lower
reward is assigned accordingly. This mechanism penalizes reasoning-answer
misalignment and discourages the model from relying on spurious patterns, such
as option ordering biases. We evaluate ACRE on challenging Video Reasoning
benchmarks and multimodal math reasoning benchmarks, achieving an average 2.2\%
and 1.5\% improvement for Video Reasoning and Math Reasoning tasks over the
GRPO baseline.

*Aniruddha Srinivas Joshi,Godwyn James William,Shreyas Srinivas Joshi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an uncertainty-aware post-detection framework that rescales detection confidences using statistical uncertainty and visual cues to improve fire/smoke detection in compact deep learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing compact models (YOLOv5n/YOLOv8n) for fire/smoke detection suffer from false positives and missed detections, while conventional post-detection methods like NMS/Soft-NMS rely only on spatial overlap, which can suppress true positives or retain false alarms.

Method: A lightweight Confidence Refinement Network that integrates uncertainty estimates with color, edge, and texture features to adjust detection scores without modifying the base model.

Result: Experiments on D-Fire dataset show improved precision, recall, and mean average precision compared to existing baselines with modest computational overhead.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances robustness of compact deep learning models for real-world fire and smoke detection through post-detection rescoring.

Abstract: Accurate fire and smoke detection is critical for safety and disaster
response, yet existing vision-based methods face challenges in balancing
efficiency and reliability. Compact deep learning models such as YOLOv5n and
YOLOv8n are widely adopted for deployment on UAVs, CCTV systems, and IoT
devices, but their reduced capacity often results in false positives and missed
detections. Conventional post-detection methods such as Non-Maximum Suppression
and Soft-NMS rely only on spatial overlap, which can suppress true positives or
retain false alarms in cluttered or ambiguous fire scenes. To address these
limitations, we propose an uncertainty aware post-detection framework that
rescales detection confidences using both statistical uncertainty and domain
relevant visual cues. A lightweight Confidence Refinement Network integrates
uncertainty estimates with color, edge, and texture features to adjust
detection scores without modifying the base model. Experiments on the D-Fire
dataset demonstrate improved precision, recall, and mean average precision
compared to existing baselines, with only modest computational overhead. These
results highlight the effectiveness of post-detection rescoring in enhancing
the robustness of compact deep learning models for real-world fire and smoke
detection.

TL;DR: ICFC is a training-free framework that uses multi-modal LLMs for interpretable image manipulation localization, achieving state-of-the-art performance without requiring pixel-level annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image tampering poses serious security threats, and while supervised methods work well, they require costly pixel-level annotations. Existing weakly supervised or training-free alternatives underperform and lack interpretability.

Method: ICFC integrates objectified rule construction with adaptive filtering to build a reliable knowledge base, and uses a multi-step progressive reasoning pipeline that mirrors expert forensic workflows from coarse to fine-grained analysis.

Result: Across multiple benchmarks, ICFC surpasses state-of-the-art training-free methods and achieves competitive or superior performance compared to weakly and fully supervised approaches.

Conclusion: ICFC enables systematic exploitation of MLLM reasoning for image-level classification, pixel-level localization, and text-level interpretability, providing an effective training-free solution for image manipulation detection.

Abstract: Advances in image tampering pose serious security threats, underscoring the
need for effective image manipulation localization (IML). While supervised IML
achieves strong performance, it depends on costly pixel-level annotations.
Existing weakly supervised or training-free alternatives often underperform and
lack interpretability. We propose the In-Context Forensic Chain (ICFC), a
training-free framework that leverages multi-modal large language models
(MLLMs) for interpretable IML tasks. ICFC integrates an objectified rule
construction with adaptive filtering to build a reliable knowledge base and a
multi-step progressive reasoning pipeline that mirrors expert forensic
workflows from coarse proposals to fine-grained forensics results. This design
enables systematic exploitation of MLLM reasoning for image-level
classification, pixel-level localization, and text-level interpretability.
Across multiple benchmarks, ICFC not only surpasses state-of-the-art
training-free methods but also achieves competitive or superior performance
compared to weakly and fully supervised approaches.

*Yuxi Mi,Qiuyang Yuan,Zhizhou Zhong,Xuan Zhao,Jiaogen Zhou,Fubao Zhu,Jihong Guan,Shuigeng Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ImmerIris is a large-scale VR headset-collected dataset for off-axis iris recognition, addressing challenges like perspective distortion in immersive applications. The paper also proposes a normalization-free method that outperforms traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Immersive applications like AR/VR require iris recognition in off-axis scenarios with perspective distortion and quality degradation, but existing datasets are scarce and methods designed for on-axis acquisition perform poorly.

Method: Introduced ImmerIris dataset with 499,791 ocular images from 564 subjects collected via VR headsets, and proposed a normalization-free paradigm that directly learns from ocular images with minimal adjustment.

Result: Current normalization-based methods perform unsatisfactorily on immersive setup, while the proposed normalization-free approach consistently outperforms them despite its simplicity.

Conclusion: The normalization-free paradigm shows promise for robust immersive iris recognition, pointing to a new direction beyond traditional normalization-based approaches.

Abstract: In egocentric applications such as augmented and virtual reality, immersive
iris recognition is emerging as an accurate and seamless way to identify
persons. While classic systems acquire iris images on-axis, i.e., via dedicated
frontal sensors in controlled settings, the immersive setup primarily captures
off-axis irises through tilt-placed headset cameras, with only mild control in
open scenes. This yields unique challenges, including perspective distortion,
intensified quality degradations, and intra-class variations in iris texture.
Datasets capturing these challenges remain scarce. To fill this gap, this paper
introduces ImmerIris, a large-scale dataset collected via VR headsets,
containing 499,791 ocular images from 564 subjects. It is, to the best of
current knowledge, the largest public dataset and among the first dedicated to
off-axis acquisition. Based on ImmerIris, evaluation protocols are constructed
to benchmark recognition methods under different challenging factors. Current
methods, primarily designed for classic on-axis imagery, perform
unsatisfactorily on the immersive setup, mainly due to reliance on fallible
normalization. To this end, this paper further proposes a normalization-free
paradigm that directly learns from ocular images with minimal adjustment.
Despite its simplicity, this approach consistently outperforms
normalization-based counterparts, pointing to a promising direction for robust
immersive recognition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-class Parkinson's disease severity detection system using finger tapping videos with attention-enhanced CNN-BiLSTM architecture achieves strong performance in classifying five severity levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current gesture-based PD recognition systems have unsatisfactory accuracy, and accurate PD severity evaluation is crucial for clinical management and intervention development.

Method: Collected finger tapping videos, extracted temporal/frequency/amplitude features from wrist/hand movements, and built a hybrid CNN-BiLSTM-attention framework with Conv1D MaxPooling, BiLSTM layers, attention mechanism, and feature concatenation.

Result: The model demonstrated strong performance in distinguishing between the five PD severity classes.

Conclusion: Integrating spatial-temporal representations with attention mechanisms can improve automated PD severity detection, making it a promising non-invasive tool for clinical PD monitoring and progression tracking.

Abstract: Effective clinical management and intervention development depend on accurate
evaluation of Parkinsons disease (PD) severity. Many researchers have worked on
developing gesture-based PD recognition systems; however, their performance
accuracy is not satisfactory. In this study, we propose a multi-class Parkinson
Disease detection system based on finger tapping using an attention-enhanced
CNN BiLSTM. We collected finger tapping videos and derived temporal, frequency,
and amplitude based features from wrist and hand movements. Then, we proposed a
hybrid deep learning framework integrating CNN, BiLSTM, and attention
mechanisms for multi-class PD severity classification from video-derived motion
features. First, the input sequence is reshaped and passed through a Conv1D
MaxPooling block to capture local spatial dependencies. The resulting feature
maps are fed into a BiLSTM layer to model temporal dynamics. An attention
mechanism focuses on the most informative temporal features, producing a
context vector that is further processed by a second BiLSTM layer. CNN-derived
features and attention-enhanced BiLSTM outputs are concatenated, followed by
dense and dropout layers, before the final softmax classifier outputs the
predicted PD severity level. The model demonstrated strong performance in
distinguishing between the five severity classes, suggesting that integrating
spatial temporal representations with attention mechanisms can improve
automated PD severity detection, making it a promising non-invasive tool to
support clinicians in PD monitoring and progression tracking.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepFusionNet is a lightweight autoencoder-based architecture that addresses both low-light image enhancement and super-resolution tasks with significantly fewer parameters than existing methods, achieving competitive SSIM and PSNR scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for low-light image enhancement and super-resolution suffer from high computational requirements and suboptimal performance metrics (low SSIM/PSNR), necessitating more efficient and effective solutions.

Method: Developed DeepFusionNet architecture using autoencoder-based approach instead of GANs, with approximately 2.5M parameters for low-light enhancement and only 100K parameters for super-resolution tasks.

Result: For low-light enhancement on LOL-v1 dataset: SSIM 92.8%, PSNR 26.30. For super-resolution: PSNR 25.30, SSIM 80.7% on validation set.

Conclusion: DeepFusionNet provides an efficient and effective solution for both low-light image enhancement and super-resolution tasks with significantly reduced parameter counts while maintaining competitive performance metrics.

Abstract: Computer vision and image processing applications suffer from dark and
low-light images, particularly during real-time image transmission. Currently,
low light and dark images are converted to bright and colored forms using
autoencoders; however, these methods often achieve low SSIM and PSNR scores and
require high computational power due to their large number of parameters. To
address these challenges, the DeepFusionNet architecture has been developed.
According to the results obtained with the LOL-v1 dataset, DeepFusionNet
achieved an SSIM of 92.8% and a PSNR score of 26.30, while containing only
approximately 2.5 million parameters. On the other hand, conversion of blurry
and low-resolution images into high-resolution and blur-free images has gained
importance in image processing applications. Unlike GAN-based super-resolution
methods, an autoencoder-based super resolution model has been developed that
contains approximately 100 thousand parameters and uses the DeepFusionNet
architecture. According to the results of the tests, the DeepFusionNet based
super-resolution method achieved a PSNR of 25.30 and a SSIM score of 80.7
percent according to the validation set.

Conclusion: YOLOv11-Litchi is suitable for UAV-based litchi detection in complex orchard environments and shows potential for broader precision agriculture applications.

Abstract: Litchi is a high-value fruit, yet traditional manual selection methods are
increasingly inadequate for modern production demands. Integrating UAV-based
aerial imagery with deep learning offers a promising solution to enhance
efficiency and reduce costs. This paper introduces YOLOv11-Litchi, a
lightweight and robust detection model specifically designed for UAV-based
litchi detection. Built upon the YOLOv11 framework, the proposed model
addresses key challenges such as small target size, large model parameters
hindering deployment, and frequent target occlusion. To tackle these issues,
three major innovations are incorporated: a multi-scale residual module to
improve contextual feature extraction across scales, a lightweight feature
fusion method to reduce model size and computational costs while maintaining
high accuracy, and a litchi occlusion detection head to mitigate occlusion
effects by emphasizing target regions and suppressing background interference.
Experimental results validate the model's effectiveness. YOLOv11-Litchi
achieves a parameter size of 6.35 MB - 32.5% smaller than the YOLOv11 baseline
- while improving mAP by 2.5% to 90.1% and F1-Score by 1.4% to 85.5%.
Additionally, the model achieves a frame rate of 57.2 FPS, meeting real-time

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Color3D is a flexible framework for colorizing static and dynamic 3D scenes from monochrome inputs, enabling diverse color reconstructions with user control while maintaining cross-view and cross-time consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus only on static scenes and enforce multi-view consistency by averaging colors, which sacrifices chromatic richness and controllability. There's a need for preserving color diversity and steerability while ensuring consistency across views and time.

Method: Colorize a single key view, then fine-tune a personalized colorizer to propagate colors to novel views and time steps. The colorizer learns scene-specific deterministic color mapping and projects colors consistently using inherent inductive bias. Uses Lab color space Gaussian splatting representation for reconstruction.

Result: Extensive experiments show Color3D delivers more consistent and chromatically rich renderings with precise user control across diverse static and dynamic 3D colorization benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework successfully recasts complex 3D colorization as a tractable single image paradigm, allowing seamless integration of arbitrary image colorization models with enhanced flexibility and controllability.

Abstract: In this work, we present Color3D, a highly adaptable framework for colorizing
both static and dynamic 3D scenes from monochromatic inputs, delivering
visually diverse and chromatically vibrant reconstructions with flexible
user-guided control. In contrast to existing methods that focus solely on
static scenarios and enforce multi-view consistency by averaging color
variations which inevitably sacrifice both chromatic richness and
controllability, our approach is able to preserve color diversity and
steerability while ensuring cross-view and cross-time consistency. In
particular, the core insight of our method is to colorize only a single key
view and then fine-tune a personalized colorizer to propagate its color to
novel views and time steps. Through personalization, the colorizer learns a
scene-specific deterministic color mapping underlying the reference view,
enabling it to consistently project corresponding colors to the content in
novel views and video frames via its inherent inductive bias. Once trained, the
personalized colorizer can be applied to infer consistent chrominance for all
other images, enabling direct reconstruction of colorful 3D scenes with a
dedicated Lab color space Gaussian splatting representation. The proposed
framework ingeniously recasts complicated 3D colorization as a more tractable
single image paradigm, allowing seamless integration of arbitrary image
colorization models with enhanced flexibility and controllability. Extensive
experiments across diverse static and dynamic 3D colorization benchmarks
substantiate that our method can deliver more consistent and chromatically rich
renderings with precise user control. Project Page

*Benjia Zhou,Bin Fu,Pei Cheng,Yanru Wang,Jiayuan Fan,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReMix is a unified framework for character-consistent generation and editing that uses a ReMix Module and IP-ControlNet to maintain identity consistency across image instances while preserving spatial controllability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to unify character generation and editing in a single framework - generation approaches lack fine-grained identity consistency, while editing methods lose spatial controllability and instruction alignment.

Method: ReMix consists of two components: (1) ReMix Module that uses MLLMs to edit semantic features and adapt instruction embeddings to DiT backbone without fine-tuning, and (2) IP-ControlNet that extends ControlNet to decouple semantic/layout cues and uses an ε-equivariant latent space for joint denoising in shared noise space.

Result: ReMix supports personalized generation, image editing, style transfer, and multi-condition synthesis while maintaining character consistency and spatial controllability. Extensive experiments validate its effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: ReMix successfully bridges the gap between character generation and editing by providing a unified framework that ensures identity consistency while preserving spatial controllability and instruction alignment.

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., FLUX.1)
have greatly improved visual fidelity in consistent character generation and
editing. However, existing methods rarely unify these tasks within a single
framework. Generation-based approaches struggle with fine-grained identity
consistency across instances, while editing-based methods often lose spatial
controllability and instruction alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose
ReMix, a unified framework for character-consistent generation and editing. It
constitutes two core components: the ReMix Module and IP-ControlNet. The ReMix
Module leverages the multimodal reasoning ability of MLLMs to edit semantic
features of input images and adapt instruction embeddings to the native DiT
backbone without fine-tuning. While this ensures coherent semantic layouts,
pixel-level consistency and pose controllability remain challenging. To address
this, IP-ControlNet extends ControlNet to decouple semantic and layout cues
from reference images and introduces an {\epsilon}-equivariant latent space
that jointly denoises the reference and target images within a shared noise
space. Inspired by convergent evolution and quantum decoherence,i.e., where
environmental noise drives state convergence, this design promotes feature
alignment in the hidden space, enabling consistent object generation while
preserving identity. ReMix supports a wide range of tasks, including
personalized generation, image editing, style transfer, and multi-condition
synthesis. Extensive experiments validate its effectiveness and efficiency as a
unified framework for character-consistent image generation and editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SaFiRe is a novel framework for Referring Image Segmentation that handles ambiguous expressions through a two-phase cognitive process, using Mamba's scan-then-update property for efficient multi-cycle refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RIS methods focus on simple expressions and reduce the task to keyword matching, failing to handle referential ambiguity in real-world scenarios like object-distracting and category-implicit expressions.

Method: Proposes SaFiRe framework that mimics human two-phase cognitive process (global understanding then detail refinement), leveraging Mamba's scan-then-update property for efficient multi-cycle refinement with linear complexity.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard and proposed aRefCOCO benchmark demonstrate SaFiRe's superiority over state-of-the-art baselines in handling ambiguous referring expressions.

Conclusion: SaFiRe effectively addresses referential ambiguity in RIS through its two-phase cognitive design and efficient Mamba-based refinement, advancing the field beyond simple expression handling.

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) aims to segment the target object in an
image given a natural language expression. While recent methods leverage
pre-trained vision backbones and more training corpus to achieve impressive
results, they predominantly focus on simple expressions--short, clear noun
phrases like "red car" or "left girl". This simplification often reduces RIS to
a key word/concept matching problem, limiting the model's ability to handle
referential ambiguity in expressions. In this work, we identify two challenging
real-world scenarios: object-distracting expressions, which involve multiple
entities with contextual cues, and category-implicit expressions, where the
object class is not explicitly stated. To address the challenges, we propose a
novel framework, SaFiRe, which mimics the human two-phase cognitive
process--first forming a global understanding, then refining it through
detail-oriented inspection. This is naturally supported by Mamba's
scan-then-update property, which aligns with our phased design and enables
efficient multi-cycle refinement with linear complexity. We further introduce
aRefCOCO, a new benchmark designed to evaluate RIS models under ambiguous
referring expressions. Extensive experiments on both standard and proposed
datasets demonstrate the superiority of SaFiRe over state-of-the-art baselines.

*César Borja,Carlos Plou,Rubén Martinez-Cantín,Ana C. Murillo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SparseUWSeg is a framework for underwater semantic segmentation that uses active sampling to guide point annotation and hybrid propagation combining SAM2 and superpixels, achieving +5% mIoU improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained underwater scene analysis is challenging due to high costs of dense expert annotations. Sparse point-labels are easier to obtain but introduce challenges in annotation selection and propagation.

Method: Uses active sampling strategy to guide annotators for point label selection, then propagates sparse labels with hybrid approach leveraging both SAM2 and superpixel-based methods.

Result: Experiments on two underwater datasets show SparseUWSeg outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to +5% mIoU over D+NN baseline.

Conclusion: The main contribution is an effective interactive annotation tool that enables ecology researchers to efficiently generate high-quality segmentation masks by leveraging foundation models and computer vision.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is essential to automate underwater imagery analysis
with ecology monitoring purposes. Unfortunately, fine grained underwater scene
analysis is still an open problem even for top performing segmentation models.
The high cost of obtaining dense, expert-annotated, segmentation labels hinders
the supervision of models in this domain. While sparse point-labels are easier
to obtain, they introduce challenges regarding which points to annotate and how
to propagate the sparse information. We present SparseUWSeg, a novel framework
that addresses both issues. SparseUWSeg employs an active sampling strategy to
guide annotators, maximizing the value of their point labels. Then, it
propagates these sparse labels with a hybrid approach leverages both the best
of SAM2 and superpixel-based methods. Experiments on two diverse underwater
datasets demonstrate the benefits of SparseUWSeg over state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving up to +5\% mIoU over D+NN. Our main contribution is the
design and release of a simple but effective interactive annotation tool,
integrating our algorithms. It enables ecology researchers to leverage
foundation models and computer vision to efficiently generate high-quality
segmentation masks to process their data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViConEx-Med is a transformer-based framework that uses multi-concept learnable tokens to jointly predict and localize visual concepts, providing both numerical and visual explanations for model decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept-based models treat concepts as numerical attributes without visual localization, limiting their utility in real-world applications like medical scenarios where visual explanations are crucial.

Method: Proposes ViConEx-Med with multi-concept learnable tokens and specialized attention layers for processing visual and text-based concept tokens to generate concept-level localization maps.

Result: Outperforms prior concept-based models and achieves competitive performance with black-box models in both concept detection and localization precision on synthetic and real-world medical datasets.

Conclusion: ViConEx-Med represents a promising direction for building inherently interpretable models grounded in visual concepts, with publicly available code for further development.

Abstract: Concept-based models aim to explain model decisions with human-understandable
concepts. However, most existing approaches treat concepts as numerical
attributes, without providing complementary visual explanations that could
localize the predicted concepts. This limits their utility in real-world
applications and particularly in high-stakes scenarios, such as medical
use-cases. This paper proposes ViConEx-Med, a novel transformer-based framework
for visual concept explainability, which introduces multi-concept learnable
tokens to jointly predict and localize visual concepts. By leveraging
specialized attention layers for processing visual and text-based concept
tokens, our method produces concept-level localization maps while maintaining
high predictive accuracy. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world medical
datasets demonstrate that ViConEx-Med outperforms prior concept-based models
and achieves competitive performance with black-box models in terms of both
concept detection and localization precision. Our results suggest a promising
direction for building inherently interpretable models grounded in visual
concepts. Code is publicly available at

*Yulin Wang,Mengting Hu,Hongli Li,Chen Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using both front and back object surfaces with hierarchical encoding to create ultra-dense 2D-3D correspondences for improved pose estimation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pose estimation methods focus only on object front surfaces, missing potential benefits from incorporating back surfaces and object interiors for better accuracy.

Method: Predicts 3D coordinates of both front and back surfaces, densely samples coordinates between them to create ultra-dense 2D-3D correspondences, and uses Hierarchical Continuous Coordinate Encoding (HCCE) for efficient representation.

Result: Outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across seven classic BOP core datasets on the BOP website.

Conclusion: Incorporating full object surfaces and interiors through ultra-dense correspondences significantly improves pose estimation accuracy compared to front-surface-only approaches.

Abstract: In pose estimation for seen objects, a prevalent pipeline involves using
neural networks to predict dense 3D coordinates of the object surface on 2D
images, which are then used to establish dense 2D-3D correspondences. However,
current methods primarily focus on more efficient encoding techniques to
improve the precision of predicted 3D coordinates on the object's front
surface, overlooking the potential benefits of incorporating the back surface
and interior of the object. To better utilize the full surface and interior of
the object, this study predicts 3D coordinates of both the object's front and
back surfaces and densely samples 3D coordinates between them. This process
creates ultra-dense 2D-3D correspondences, effectively enhancing pose
estimation accuracy based on the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm.
Additionally, we propose Hierarchical Continuous Coordinate Encoding (HCCE) to
provide a more accurate and efficient representation of front and back surface
coordinates. Experimental results show that, compared to existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the BOP website, the proposed approach
outperforms across seven classic BOP core datasets. Code is available at

*Zixu Zhao,Yang Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DVTMD, a new drone video-text dataset with fine-grained captions, and proposes TCMA framework for text-video retrieval that achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAVs produce massive aerial videos but efficient content retrieval is challenging due to limitations in existing datasets with coarse and redundant captions. The drone domain remains underexplored for text-video retrieval.

Method: Constructed DVTMD dataset with 2,864 videos and 14,320 fine-grained captions capturing multiple aspects. Proposed TCMA framework with global video-sentence alignment, sentence-guided frame aggregation, word-guided patch alignment, plus Word and Patch Selection module and Text-Adaptive Dynamic Temperature Mechanism.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance with 45.5% R@1 in text-to-video and 42.8% R@1 in video-to-text retrieval on DVTMD and CapERA datasets, establishing the first complete benchmark for drone text-video retrieval.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and TCMA framework effectively address drone video-text retrieval challenges, demonstrating superior performance through multi-granularity alignment and adaptive mechanisms.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become powerful platforms for real-time,
high-resolution data collection, producing massive volumes of aerial videos.
Efficient retrieval of relevant content from these videos is crucial for
applications in urban management, emergency response, security, and disaster
relief. While text-video retrieval has advanced in natural video domains, the
UAV domain remains underexplored due to limitations in existing datasets, such
as coarse and redundant captions. Thus, in this work, we construct the Drone
Video-Text Match Dataset (DVTMD), which contains 2,864 videos and 14,320
fine-grained, semantically diverse captions. The annotations capture multiple
complementary aspects, including human actions, objects, background settings,
environmental conditions, and visual style, thereby enhancing text-video
correspondence and reducing redundancy. Building on this dataset, we propose
the Text-Conditioned Multi-granularity Alignment (TCMA) framework, which
integrates global video-sentence alignment, sentence-guided frame aggregation,
and word-guided patch alignment. To further refine local alignment, we design a
Word and Patch Selection module that filters irrelevant content, as well as a
Text-Adaptive Dynamic Temperature Mechanism that adapts attention sharpness to
text type. Extensive experiments on DVTMD and CapERA establish the first
complete benchmark for drone text-video retrieval. Our TCMA achieves
state-of-the-art performance, including 45.5% R@1 in text-to-video and 42.8%
R@1 in video-to-text retrieval, demonstrating the effectiveness of our dataset
and method. The code and dataset will be released.

*Haohua Dong,Ana Manzano Rodríguez,Camille Guinaudeau,Shin'ichi Satoh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pseudo-balancing is a semi-supervised learning method that mitigates demographic bias in face gender classification by enforcing demographic balance during pseudo-label selection using only unlabeled race-balanced data, improving fairness while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face gender classification models often reflect and amplify demographic biases from training data, leading to uneven performance across gender and racial subgroups.

Method: Pseudo-balancing enforces demographic balance during pseudo-label selection using only unlabeled images from a race-balanced dataset without requiring ground-truth annotations. Evaluated through fine-tuning biased classifiers and stress-testing with imbalanced data.

Result: Achieved 79.81% overall accuracy (6.53% improvement over baseline), reduced gender accuracy gap by 44.17%, and narrowed East Asian subgroup disparity from over 49% to just 5.01%.

Conclusion: Even without label supervision, access to demographically balanced unlabeled datasets can effectively debias computer vision models while preserving or enhancing accuracy.

Abstract: Face gender classification models often reflect and amplify demographic
biases present in their training data, leading to uneven performance across
gender and racial subgroups. We introduce pseudo-balancing, a simple and
effective strategy for mitigating such biases in semi-supervised learning. Our
method enforces demographic balance during pseudo-label selection, using only
unlabeled images from a race-balanced dataset without requiring access to
ground-truth annotations.
  We evaluate pseudo-balancing under two conditions: (1) fine-tuning a biased
gender classifier using unlabeled images from the FairFace dataset, and (2)
stress-testing the method with intentionally imbalanced training data to
simulate controlled bias scenarios. In both cases, models are evaluated on the
All-Age-Faces (AAF) benchmark, which contains a predominantly East Asian
population. Our results show that pseudo-balancing consistently improves
fairness while preserving or enhancing accuracy. The method achieves 79.81%
overall accuracy - a 6.53% improvement over the baseline - and reduces the
gender accuracy gap by 44.17%. In the East Asian subgroup, where baseline
disparities exceeded 49%, the gap is narrowed to just 5.01%. These findings
suggest that even in the absence of label supervision, access to a
demographically balanced or moderately skewed unlabeled dataset can serve as a
powerful resource for debiasing existing computer vision models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A progressive relational learning framework for 3D object grounding that extends from binary to n-ary relationships to better handle complex spatial descriptions involving multiple objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods only model pairwise object relationships, ignoring the global perceptual significance of n-ary combinations in multi-modal relational understanding, making 3D-language alignment difficult for descriptions involving multiple spatial relationships.

Method: Proposed a progressive relational learning framework that extends relational learning from binary to n-ary relationships, uses grouped supervision loss for n-ary relational learning, and employs a multi-modal network with hybrid attention mechanisms to localize targets within n-ary combinations.

Result: Experiments on ReferIt3D and ScanRefer benchmarks demonstrate that the method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The method proves the advantages of n-ary relational perception in 3D localization, showing improved performance in handling complex spatial descriptions involving multiple objects.

Abstract: Localizing 3D objects using natural language is essential for robotic scene
understanding. The descriptions often involve multiple spatial relationships to
distinguish similar objects, making 3D-language alignment difficult. Current
methods only model relationships for pairwise objects, ignoring the global
perceptual significance of n-ary combinations in multi-modal relational
understanding. To address this, we propose a novel progressive relational
learning framework for 3D object grounding. We extend relational learning from
binary to n-ary to identify visual relations that match the referential
description globally. Given the absence of specific annotations for referred
objects in the training data, we design a grouped supervision loss to
facilitate n-ary relational learning. In the scene graph created with n-ary
relationships, we use a multi-modal network with hybrid attention mechanisms to
further localize the target within the n-ary combinations. Experiments and
ablation studies on the ReferIt3D and ScanRefer benchmarks demonstrate that our
method outperforms the state-of-the-art, and proves the advantages of the n-ary
relational perception in 3D localization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cervical cancer requires complex histopathological assessments, but current deep learning models lack accuracy and generalizability, while general foundation models fail to capture subspecialty-specific features.

Method: Two-stage pretraining: self-supervised learning on 190M tissue patches from 140K slides for cervical-specific feature extraction, followed by multimodal enhancement with 2.5M image-text pairs, integrated with multiple downstream diagnostic functions.

Result: CerS-Path supports 8 diagnostic functions including rare cancer classification and multimodal Q&A, achieving 99.38% screening sensitivity in prospective testing on 3,173 cases across 5 centers with excellent generalizability.

Conclusion: The system represents a significant advance in cervical pathology, demonstrating strong potential for subspecialty diagnostic translation and cervical cancer screening applications.

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a major malignancy, necessitating extensive and
complex histopathological assessments and comprehensive support tools. Although
deep learning shows promise, these models still lack accuracy and
generalizability. General foundation models offer a broader reach but remain
limited in capturing subspecialty-specific features and task adaptability. We
introduce the Cervical Subspecialty Pathology (CerS-Path) diagnostic system,
developed through two synergistic pretraining stages: self-supervised learning
on approximately 190 million tissue patches from 140,000 slides to build a
cervical-specific feature extractor, and multimodal enhancement with 2.5
million image-text pairs, followed by integration with multiple downstream
diagnostic functions. Supporting eight diagnostic functions, including rare
cancer classification and multimodal Q&A, CerS-Path surpasses prior foundation
models in scope and clinical applicability. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate a significant advance in cervical pathology, with prospective
testing on 3,173 cases across five centers maintaining 99.38% screening
sensitivity and excellent generalizability, highlighting its potential for
subspecialty diagnostic translation and cervical cancer screening.

TL;DR: Proposes Style Embedding Distribution Discrepancy (SEDD) as a novel metric to quantify the synthetic-to-real gap in autonomous driving perception systems, enabling systematic evaluation and enhancement of synthetic datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world testing of autonomous driving systems is impractical, making synthetic datasets essential, but the domain gap between synthetic and real data limits model generalization. Quantifying this gap is crucial for evaluating dataset utility and improving training pipelines.

Method: Establishes a systematic framework combining Gram matrix-based style extraction with metric learning optimized for intra-class compactness and inter-class separation to extract style embeddings, and proposes SEDD as the evaluation metric.

Result: Experiments on various datasets and sim-to-real methods demonstrate that the proposed method effectively quantifies the synthetic-to-real gap, providing a standardized quality control tool.

Conclusion: This work provides a systematic framework for diagnosing and enhancing synthetic datasets, advancing the development of data-driven autonomous driving systems through better quantification of the synthetic-to-real domain gap.

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of autonomous driving perception systems requires
extensive environment-based testing, yet real-world execution is often
impractical. Synthetic datasets have therefore emerged as a promising
alternative, offering advantages such as cost-effectiveness, bias free
labeling, and controllable scenarios. However, the domain gap between synthetic
and real-world datasets remains a critical bottleneck for the generalization of
AI-based autonomous driving models. Quantifying this synthetic-to-real gap is
thus essential for evaluating dataset utility and guiding the design of more
effective training pipelines. In this paper, we establish a systematic
framework for quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap in autonomous driving
systems, and propose Style Embedding Distribution Discrepancy (SEDD) as a novel
evaluation metric. Our framework combines Gram matrix-based style extraction
with metric learning optimized for intra-class compactness and inter-class
separation to extract style embeddings. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark
using publicly available datasets. Experiments are conducted on a variety of
datasets and sim-to-real methods, and the results show that our method is
capable of quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap. This work provides a
standardized quality control tool that enables systematic diagnosis and
targeted enhancement of synthetic datasets, advancing future development of
data-driven autonomous driving systems.

Motivation: AI-generated content often contains subtle semantic anomalies like unrealistic object configurations and violations of physical laws, which compromise plausibility and trustworthiness, necessitating better detection methods.

Method: Developed AnomReason benchmark with quadruple annotations (Name, Phenomenon, Reasoning, Severity) using AnomAgent - a modular multi-agent pipeline with human verification, processing 4.17B GPT-4o tokens.

Result: Models fine-tuned on AnomReason achieve consistent gains over strong baselines using semantic matching metrics (SemAP and SemF1), demonstrating practical utility in explainable deepfake detection and semantic reasonableness assessment.

Conclusion: AnomReason and AnomAgent provide a foundation for measuring and improving semantic plausibility of AI-generated images, with released resources supporting reproducible research on semantic authenticity and interpretable AIGC forensics.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of
  AI-generated content (AIGC) has enabled the synthesis of visually convincing
images; however, many such outputs exhibit subtle \textbf{semantic anomalies},
including unrealistic object configurations, violations of physical laws, or
commonsense inconsistencies, which compromise the overall plausibility of the
generated scenes. Detecting these semantic-level anomalies
  is essential for assessing the trustworthiness of AIGC media, especially in
AIGC image analysis, explainable deepfake detection and semantic authenticity
assessment. In this paper,
  we formalize \textbf{semantic anomaly detection and reasoning} for AIGC
images and
  introduce \textbf{AnomReason}, a large-scale benchmark with structured
annotations as quadruples \emph{(Name, Phenomenon, Reasoning, Severity)}.
Annotations are produced by
  a modular multi-agent pipeline (\textbf{AnomAgent}) with lightweight
human-in-the-loop verification, enabling scale while preserving quality.
  At construction time, AnomAgent processed approximately 4.17\,B GPT-4o
tokens, providing scale evidence for the resulting structured annotations. We
further
  show that models fine-tuned on AnomReason achieve consistent gains over
strong vision-language baselines under our proposed semantic matching metric
(\textit{SemAP} and \textit{SemF1}).
  Applications to {explainable deepfake detection} and {semantic reasonableness
assessment of image generators} demonstrate practical utility. In summary,
AnomReason and AnomAgent
  serve as a foundation for measuring and improving the semantic plausibility
of AI-generated images. We will release code, metrics, data, and task-aligned
models to support reproducible research on semantic authenticity and
interpretable AIGC forensics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Large vision models (LVM) demonstrate strong zero-shot performance on medical imaging tasks including organ segmentation, denoising, super-resolution, and motion prediction, without any domain-specific training on medical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether autoregressive video modeling principles can be directly applied to medical imaging tasks, leveraging the zero-shot generalization capabilities of large generative models.

Method: Evaluated a large vision model (LVM) in zero-shot setting across four medical tasks: organ segmentation, denoising, super-resolution, and motion prediction using 4D CT data from 122 patients (over 1,820 3D CT volumes).

Result: The LVM achieved competitive performance on segmentation, denoising, and super-resolution, and surpassed specialized baselines in motion prediction with state-of-the-art spatial accuracy, producing anatomically consistent predictions with realistic temporal coherence.

Conclusion: Large vision models exhibit emergent zero-shot capabilities in medical video modeling, demonstrating potential as unified learners and reasoners for future medical foundation models built on video models.

Abstract: Recent advances in large generative models have shown that simple
autoregressive formulations, when scaled appropriately, can exhibit strong
zero-shot generalization across domains. Motivated by this trend, we
investigate whether autoregressive video modeling principles can be directly
applied to medical imaging tasks, despite the model never being trained on
medical data. Specifically, we evaluate a large vision model (LVM) in a
zero-shot setting across four representative tasks: organ segmentation,
denoising, super-resolution, and motion prediction. Remarkably, even without
domain-specific fine-tuning, the LVM can delineate anatomical structures in CT
scans and achieve competitive performance on segmentation, denoising, and
super-resolution. Most notably, in radiotherapy motion prediction, the model
forecasts future 3D CT phases directly from prior phases of a 4D CT scan,
producing anatomically consistent predictions that capture patient-specific
respiratory dynamics with realistic temporal coherence. We evaluate the LVM on
4D CT data from 122 patients, totaling over 1,820 3D CT volumes. Despite no
prior exposure to medical data, the model achieves strong performance across
all tasks and surpasses specialized DVF-based and generative baselines in
motion prediction, achieving state-of-the-art spatial accuracy. These findings
reveal the emergence of zero-shot capabilities in medical video modeling and
highlight the potential of general-purpose video models to serve as unified
learners and reasoners laying the groundwork for future medical foundation
models built on video models.

*Abdelrhman Elrawy,Emad A. Mohammed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework that improves 3D Gaussian Splatting efficiency in few-shot scenarios by replacing positional gradient densification with opacity gradient triggers and conservative pruning, achieving 40-70% more compact reconstructions with minimal quality trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting struggles with overfitting and bloated reconstructions in few-shot scenarios, and existing improvements often significantly increase primitive counts without addressing efficiency.

Method: Replaces standard positional gradient heuristic with opacity gradient as densification trigger, pairs aggressive densification with conservative pruning schedule, and uses depth-correlation loss for geometric guidance.

Result: Achieves 40% more compact reconstructions than FSGS on 3-view LLFF dataset (32k vs 57k primitives) and ~70% reduction on Mip-NeRF 360 dataset, with modest trade-off in reconstruction metrics.

Conclusion: Establishes new state-of-the-art on quality-vs-efficiency Pareto frontier for few-shot view synthesis through fundamental optimization improvements to 3DGS core algorithm.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles in few-shot scenarios, where its
standard adaptive density control (ADC) can lead to overfitting and bloated
reconstructions. While state-of-the-art methods like FSGS improve quality, they
often do so by significantly increasing the primitive count. This paper
presents a framework that revises the core 3DGS optimization to prioritize
efficiency. We replace the standard positional gradient heuristic with a novel
densification trigger that uses the opacity gradient as a lightweight proxy for
rendering error. We find this aggressive densification is only effective when
paired with a more conservative pruning schedule, which prevents destructive
optimization cycles. Combined with a standard depth-correlation loss for
geometric guidance, our framework demonstrates a fundamental improvement in
efficiency. On the 3-view LLFF dataset, our model is over 40% more compact (32k
vs. 57k primitives) than FSGS, and on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset, it achieves a
reduction of approximately 70%. This dramatic gain in compactness is achieved
with a modest trade-off in reconstruction metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art on the quality-vs-efficiency Pareto frontier for few-shot view
synthesis.

TL;DR: VividAnimator is an end-to-end framework for generating high-quality half-body human animations driven by audio and sparse hand pose conditions, addressing stiff head movements and blurry hands through three key innovations: Hand Clarity Codebook, Dual-Stream Audio-Aware Module, and Pose Calibration Trick.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing audio- and pose-driven human animation methods struggle with stiff head movements and blurry hands due to weak correlation between audio and head movements, and the structural complexity of hands.

Method: Three key innovations: 1) Pre-trained Hand Clarity Codebook (HCC) for high-fidelity hand texture priors, 2) Dual-Stream Audio-Aware Module (DSAA) for separate modeling of lip sync and head pose dynamics with interaction, 3) Pose Calibration Trick (PCT) for refining pose conditions by relaxing rigid constraints.

Result: Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance with superior hand detail, gesture realism, and identity consistency, validated by both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: VividAnimator effectively addresses key challenges in human animation by combining audio-driven motion with high-quality hand synthesis, producing natural and realistic animations.

Abstract: Existing for audio- and pose-driven human animation methods often struggle
with stiff head movements and blurry hands, primarily due to the weak
correlation between audio and head movements and the structural complexity of
hands. To address these issues, we propose VividAnimator, an end-to-end
framework for generating high-quality, half-body human animations driven by
audio and sparse hand pose conditions. Our framework introduces three key
innovations. First, to overcome the instability and high cost of online
codebook training, we pre-train a Hand Clarity Codebook (HCC) that encodes
rich, high-fidelity hand texture priors, significantly mitigating hand
degradation. Second, we design a Dual-Stream Audio-Aware Module (DSAA) to model
lip synchronization and natural head pose dynamics separately while enabling
interaction. Third, we introduce a Pose Calibration Trick (PCT) that refines
and aligns pose conditions by relaxing rigid constraints, ensuring smooth and
natural gesture transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Vivid
Animator achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing videos with superior
hand detail, gesture realism, and identity consistency, validated by both
quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations.

Method: Proposes a hybrid framework that incorporates both PV and BEV features, introduces BEV maps guided by foundation models using DINOv2 features, distills features through a novel process, and integrates them via deformable aggregation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes and Argoverse 2 benchmarks, demonstrating enhanced 3D object detection and tracking capabilities.

Conclusion: Foundation model BEV maps enable more reliable perception for autonomous driving, and the hybrid approach leveraging both PV and BEV features shows significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Camera-based 3D object detection and tracking are essential for perception in
autonomous driving. Current state-of-the-art approaches often rely exclusively
on either perspective-view (PV) or bird's-eye-view (BEV) features, limiting
their ability to leverage both fine-grained object details and spatially
structured scene representations. In this work, we propose DualViewDistill, a
hybrid detection and tracking framework that incorporates both PV and BEV
camera image features to leverage their complementary strengths. Our approach
introduces BEV maps guided by foundation models, leveraging descriptive DINOv2
features that are distilled into BEV representations through a novel
distillation process. By integrating PV features with BEV maps enriched with
semantic and geometric features from DINOv2, our model leverages this hybrid
representation via deformable aggregation to enhance 3D object detection and
tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 benchmarks
demonstrate that DualViewDistill achieves state-of-the-art performance. The
results showcase the potential of foundation model BEV maps to enable more
reliable perception for autonomous driving. We make the code and pre-trained
models available at https://dualviewdistill.cs.uni-freiburg.de .

*Sayan Mandal,Divyadarshini Karthikeyan,Manas Paldhe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM2LoRA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that adapts SAM2 for fundus image segmentation using low-rank adapters, achieving state-of-the-art performance with less than 5% trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While SAM2 enables rapid inference in low-resource settings, fine-tuning it remains challenging. The goal is to efficiently adapt SAM2 for fundus image segmentation tasks.

Method: Integrates low-rank adapters into both image encoder and mask decoder of SAM2, using a composite loss function combining segmentationBCE, SoftDice, and FocalTversky losses for optimal tuning.

Result: Achieves Dice scores of 0.86 and 0.93 for blood vessel and optic disc segmentation respectively, with AUC values up to 0.98 and 0.99 across 11 challenging fundus datasets.

Conclusion: SAM2LoRA demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in cross-dataset fundus segmentation while substantially reducing training overhead through parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Abstract: We propose SAM2LoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy that adapts
the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for fundus image segmentation. SAM2 employs
a masked autoencoder-pretrained Hierarchical Vision Transformer for multi-scale
feature decoding, enabling rapid inference in low-resource settings; however,
fine-tuning remains challenging. To address this, SAM2LoRA integrates a
low-rank adapter into both the image encoder and mask decoder, requiring fewer
than 5\% of the original trainable parameters. Our analysis indicates that for
cross-dataset fundus segmentation tasks, a composite loss function combining
segmentationBCE, SoftDice, and FocalTversky losses is essential for optimal
network tuning. Evaluated on 11 challenging fundus segmentation datasets,
SAM2LoRA demonstrates high performance in both blood vessel and optic disc
segmentation under cross-dataset training conditions. It achieves Dice scores

TL;DR: FactoredScenes is a framework that generates realistic 3D scenes by decomposing rooms into hierarchical concepts using learned layout patterns and program-conditioned object pose prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world scenes are difficult to capture with limited data available, and generating realistic scenes with varied object poses remains an open challenge.

Method: Uses a factored representation that decomposes scenes into room programs and object poses, learns a library of layout patterns, generates programs via LLMs, and hierarchically predicts object poses conditioned on programs.

Result: Generates realistic, real-world rooms that are difficult to distinguish from real ScanNet scenes.

Conclusion: FactoredScenes successfully synthesizes realistic 3D scenes by leveraging room structure and learning object pose variations from lived-in scenes.

Abstract: Real-world scenes, such as those in ScanNet, are difficult to capture, with
highly limited data available. Generating realistic scenes with varied object
poses remains an open and challenging task. In this work, we propose
FactoredScenes, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D scenes by leveraging
the underlying structure of rooms while learning the variation of object poses
from lived-in scenes. We introduce a factored representation that decomposes
scenes into hierarchically organized concepts of room programs and object
poses. To encode structure, FactoredScenes learns a library of functions
capturing reusable layout patterns from which scenes are drawn, then uses large
language models to generate high-level programs, regularized by the learned
library. To represent scene variations, FactoredScenes learns a
program-conditioned model to hierarchically predict object poses, and retrieves
and places 3D objects in a scene. We show that FactoredScenes generates
realistic, real-world rooms that are difficult to distinguish from real ScanNet
scenes.

*Rugved Katole,Christopher Stewart*

TL;DR: Ortho-Fuse is an optical flow-based framework that enables reliable orthomosaic generation from sparse aerial imagery with reduced overlap requirements, achieving 20% lower minimum overlap needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-driven crop health mapping systems face adoption barriers due to technical limitations in orthomosaic generation from sparse aerial imagery. Traditional methods require 70-80% inter-image overlap, which resource-constrained AI systems cannot consistently achieve, leading to degraded reconstruction quality and reduced user confidence.

Method: The Ortho-Fuse framework employs intermediate optical flow estimation to synthesize transitional imagery between consecutive aerial frames, artificially augmenting feature correspondences for improved geometric reconstruction.

Result: Experimental validation demonstrates a 20% reduction in minimum overlap requirements for reliable orthomosaic generation.

Conclusion: The approach addresses key technical barriers to AI-driven monitoring system adoption in precision agriculture and identifies pathways for enhanced integration of these technologies.

Abstract: AI-driven crop health mapping systems offer substantial advantages over
conventional monitoring approaches through accelerated data acquisition and
cost reduction. However, widespread farmer adoption remains constrained by
technical limitations in orthomosaic generation from sparse aerial imagery
datasets. Traditional photogrammetric reconstruction requires 70-80\%
inter-image overlap to establish sufficient feature correspondences for
accurate geometric registration. AI-driven systems operating under
resource-constrained conditions cannot consistently achieve these overlap
thresholds, resulting in degraded reconstruction quality that undermines user
confidence in autonomous monitoring technologies. In this paper, we present
Ortho-Fuse, an optical flow-based framework that enables the generation of a
reliable orthomosaic with reduced overlap requirements. Our approach employs
intermediate flow estimation to synthesize transitional imagery between
consecutive aerial frames, artificially augmenting feature correspondences for
improved geometric reconstruction. Experimental validation demonstrates a 20\%
reduction in minimum overlap requirements. We further analyze adoption barriers
in precision agriculture to identify pathways for enhanced integration of
AI-driven monitoring systems.

TL;DR: PointMAC is a meta-learned framework for test-time adaptation in point cloud completion that enables sample-specific refinement without additional supervision through self-supervised auxiliary objectives and meta-auxiliary learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud completion models perform static inference and rely heavily on inductive biases from training, limiting their ability to adapt to novel structural patterns and sensor-induced distortions at test time.

Method: Proposes PointMAC with meta-auxiliary learning based on MAML, using self-supervised auxiliary objectives that simulate structural and sensor-level incompleteness. Features Adaptive λ-Calibration for gradient balancing and adapts only the encoder during inference while keeping decoder fixed.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic, simulated, and real-world datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art results by refining each sample individually to produce high-quality completions.

Conclusion: PointMAC is the first work to apply meta-auxiliary test-time adaptation to point cloud completion, achieving robust performance through sample-specific refinement without requiring additional supervision.

Abstract: Point cloud completion is essential for robust 3D perception in
safety-critical applications such as robotics and augmented reality. However,
existing models perform static inference and rely heavily on inductive biases
learned during training, limiting their ability to adapt to novel structural
patterns and sensor-induced distortions at test time. To address this
limitation, we propose PointMAC, a meta-learned framework for robust test-time
adaptation in point cloud completion. It enables sample-specific refinement
without requiring additional supervision. Our method optimizes the completion
model under two self-supervised auxiliary objectives that simulate structural
and sensor-level incompleteness. A meta-auxiliary learning strategy based on
Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) ensures that adaptation driven by auxiliary
objectives is consistently aligned with the primary completion task. During
inference, we adapt the shared encoder on-the-fly by optimizing auxiliary
losses, with the decoder kept fixed. To further stabilize adaptation, we
introduce Adaptive $\lambda$-Calibration, a meta-learned mechanism for
balancing gradients between primary and auxiliary objectives. Extensive
experiments on synthetic, simulated, and real-world datasets demonstrate that
PointMAC achieves state-of-the-art results by refining each sample individually
to produce high-quality completions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to apply meta-auxiliary test-time adaptation to point cloud
completion.

TL;DR: Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) like DINOv3 and SIGLIP-2 can be effectively used for PPG signal analysis by transforming 1D signals into 2D image representations, achieving state-of-the-art performance on physiological tasks including blood pressure estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether Vision Foundation Models can be repurposed for physiological signal analysis from PPG sensors, potentially outperforming specialized time-series foundation models.

Method: Transform 1D PPG signals into 2D image representations (STFT, STFT phase, recurrence plots) and fine-tune Vision Foundation Models (DINOv3, SIGLIP-2) using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on blood pressure estimation and promising results on other vital signs and blood lab measurements, with notable generalization across different 2D input representations.

Conclusion: Vision Foundation Models provide a new class of powerful, computationally efficient tools for PPG signal analysis that outperform specialized time-series models and offer strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor in wearable and clinical devices provides
valuable physiological insights in a non-invasive and real-time fashion.
Specialized Foundation Models (FM) or repurposed time-series FMs are used to
benchmark physiological tasks. Our experiments with fine-tuning FMs reveal that
Vision FM (VFM) can also be utilized for this purpose and, in fact,
surprisingly leads to state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on many tasks,
notably blood pressure estimation. We leverage VFMs by simply transforming
one-dimensional PPG signals into image-like two-dimensional representations,
such as the Short-Time Fourier transform (STFT). Using the latest VFMs, such as
DINOv3 and SIGLIP-2, we achieve promising performance on other vital signs and
blood lab measurement tasks as well. Our proposal, Vision4PPG, unlocks a new
class of FMs to achieve SOTA performance with notable generalization to other
2D input representations, including STFT phase and recurrence plots. Our work
improves upon prior investigations of vision models for PPG by conducting a
comprehensive study, comparing them to state-of-the-art time-series FMs, and
demonstrating the general PPG processing ability by reporting results on six
additional tasks. Thus, we provide clinician-scientists with a new set of
powerful tools that is also computationally efficient, thanks to
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques.

Motivation: To overcome the limitations of costly and time-intensive pixel-level annotations in pavement crack detection, enabling scalable and cost-effective infrastructure monitoring.

Method: Developed Crack-Segmenter with three modules: Scale-Adaptive Embedder (SAE) for multi-scale feature extraction, Directional Attention Transformer (DAT) for maintaining crack continuity, and Attention-Guided Fusion (AGF) for adaptive feature integration.

Result: Consistently outperformed 13 state-of-the-art supervised methods across all major metrics (mIoU, Dice score, XOR, HD) on ten public datasets.

Conclusion: Annotation-free crack detection is not only feasible but superior, enabling scalable infrastructure monitoring and advancing self-supervised learning in pavement crack detection research.

Abstract: Pavement crack detection has long depended on costly and time-intensive
pixel-level annotations, which limit its scalability for large-scale
infrastructure monitoring. To overcome this barrier, this paper examines the
feasibility of achieving effective pixel-level crack segmentation entirely
without manual annotations. Building on this objective, a fully self-supervised
framework, Crack-Segmenter, is developed, integrating three complementary
modules: the Scale-Adaptive Embedder (SAE) for robust multi-scale feature
extraction, the Directional Attention Transformer (DAT) for maintaining linear
crack continuity, and the Attention-Guided Fusion (AGF) module for adaptive
feature integration. Through evaluations on ten public datasets,
Crack-Segmenter consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art supervised methods
across all major metrics, including mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice
score, XOR, and Hausdorff Distance (HD). These findings demonstrate that
annotation-free crack detection is not only feasible but also superior,
enabling transportation agencies and infrastructure managers to conduct
scalable and cost-effective monitoring. This work advances self-supervised
learning and motivates pavement cracks detection research.

### [74] [Identifying bias in CNN image classification using image scrambling and transforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10383)
*Sai Teja Erukude*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the "black box" problem in CNNs by proposing methods to identify hidden biases and distinguish between contextual information and background noise in image classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs operate as "black boxes" where users cannot understand how decisions are made, potentially leading to biased decisions based on background information that's difficult to detect.

Method: Two approaches: 1) Dividing images into smaller non-overlapping tiles that are randomly shuffled to make classification challenging; 2) Applying image transforms (Fourier, Wavelet transforms, Median filter) and their combinations to recover background noise information used by CNNs.

Result: The methods were tested on six datasets (natural, synthetic, hybrid) and effectively distinguished between contextual information and background noise, detecting background noise presence even without using background information.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques successfully identify dataset biases and help separate meaningful contextual learning from problematic background noise in CNN-based image classification.

Abstract: CNNs are now prevalent as the primary choice for most machine vision problems
due to their superior rate of classification and the availability of
user-friendly libraries. These networks effortlessly identify and select
features in a non-intuitive data-driven manner, making it difficult to
determine which features were most influential. That leads to a ``black box",
where users cannot know how the image data are analyzed but rely on empirical
results. Therefore the decision-making process can be biased by background
information that is difficult to detect. Here we discuss examples of such
hidden biases and propose techniques for identifying them, methods to
distinguish between contextual information and background noise, and explore
whether CNNs learn from irrelevant features. One effective approach to identify
dataset bias is to classify blank background parts of the images. However, in
some situations a blank background in the images is not available, making it
more difficult to separate the foreground information from the blank
background. Such parts of the image can also be considered contextual learning,
not necessarily bias. To overcome this, we propose two approaches that were
tested on six different datasets, including natural, synthetic, and hybrid
datasets. The first method involves dividing images into smaller,
non-overlapping tiles of various sizes, which are then shuffled randomly,
making classification more challenging. The second method involves the
application of several image transforms, including Fourier, Wavelet transforms,
and Median filter, and their combinations. These transforms help recover
background noise information used by CNN to classify images. Results indicate
that this method can effectively distinguish between contextual information and
background noise, and alert on the presence of background noise even without
the need to use background information.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing open-source models across four audiovisual video captioning benchmarks, and achieves competitive performance on VDC and DREAM-1K benchmarks under visual-only settings.

Conclusion: AVoCaDO demonstrates strong capabilities in audiovisual video captioning through effective temporal orchestration between audio and visual modalities.

Abstract: Audiovisual video captioning aims to generate semantically rich descriptions
with temporal alignment between visual and auditory events, thereby benefiting
both video understanding and generation. In this paper, we present AVoCaDO, a
powerful audiovisual video captioner driven by the temporal orchestration
between audio and visual modalities. We propose a two-stage post-training
pipeline: (1) AVoCaDO SFT, which fine-tunes the model on a newly curated
dataset of 107K high-quality, temporally-aligned audiovisual captions; and (2)
AVoCaDO GRPO, which leverages tailored reward functions to further enhance
temporal coherence and dialogue accuracy while regularizing caption length and
reducing collapse. Experimental results demonstrate that AVoCaDO significantly
outperforms existing open-source models across four audiovisual video

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mesh-Gait is a novel multi-modal gait recognition framework that reconstructs 3D heatmaps from 2D silhouettes to combine the strengths of both 2D and 3D representations, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 2D gait recognition methods struggle with viewpoint variations, occlusions, and noise, while existing multi-modal approaches using 3D body shape are computationally expensive and impractical for real-time applications.

Method: Mesh-Gait reconstructs 3D heatmaps as an intermediate representation from 2D silhouettes, then extracts discriminative features from both silhouettes and 3D heatmaps. It uses supervised learning with losses calculated between reconstructed 3D joints, virtual markers, meshes and their ground truth for precise spatial alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mesh-Gait achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in gait recognition while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Mesh-Gait effectively combines 2D and 3D gait representations through intermediate 3D heatmap reconstruction, providing robust performance against viewpoint variations and occlusions while being computationally feasible for real-time applications.

Abstract: Gait recognition, a fundamental biometric technology, leverages unique
walking patterns for individual identification, typically using 2D
representations such as silhouettes or skeletons. However, these methods often
struggle with viewpoint variations, occlusions, and noise. Multi-modal
approaches that incorporate 3D body shape information offer improved robustness
but are computationally expensive, limiting their feasibility for real-time
applications. To address these challenges, we introduce Mesh-Gait, a novel
end-to-end multi-modal gait recognition framework that directly reconstructs 3D
representations from 2D silhouettes, effectively combining the strengths of
both modalities. Compared to existing methods, directly learning 3D features
from 3D joints or meshes is complex and difficult to fuse with silhouette-based
gait features. To overcome this, Mesh-Gait reconstructs 3D heatmaps as an
intermediate representation, enabling the model to effectively capture 3D
geometric information while maintaining simplicity and computational
efficiency. During training, the intermediate 3D heatmaps are gradually
reconstructed and become increasingly accurate under supervised learning, where
the loss is calculated between the reconstructed 3D joints, virtual markers,
and 3D meshes and their corresponding ground truth, ensuring precise spatial
alignment and consistent 3D structure. Mesh-Gait extracts discriminative
features from both silhouettes and reconstructed 3D heatmaps in a
computationally efficient manner. This design enables the model to capture
spatial and structural gait characteristics while avoiding the heavy overhead
of direct 3D reconstruction from RGB videos, allowing the network to focus on
motion dynamics rather than irrelevant visual details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Mesh-Gait achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. The code will be
released upon acceptance of the paper.

### [77] [Guided Image Feature Matching using Feature Spatial Order](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10414)
*Chin-Hung Teng,Ben-Jian Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method that integrates feature spatial order with epipolar geometry in a progressive matching framework to improve efficiency and accuracy of image feature matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional feature matching is time-consuming, especially for images with many features. Feature spatial order provides an independent concept from epipolar geometry that can complement it to improve matching efficiency.

Method: Integrate feature spatial order into progressive matching framework, use initial matches to build spatial order model, calculate possible spatial ranges for subsequent matches, filter unnecessary matches, combine with epipolar geometry, and use image alignment from fundamental matrix to handle rotation effects.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets, simulated images, and real images show the method is significantly more efficient and accurate than traditional methods.

Conclusion: The proposed integration of feature spatial order with epipolar geometry in progressive matching framework effectively improves both efficiency and accuracy of image feature matching.

Abstract: Image feature matching plays a vital role in many computer vision tasks.
Although many image feature detection and matching techniques have been
proposed over the past few decades, it is still time-consuming to match feature
points in two images, especially for images with a large number of detected
features. Feature spatial order can estimate the probability that a pair of
features is correct. Since it is a completely independent concept from epipolar
geometry, it can be used to complement epipolar geometry in guiding feature
match in a target region so as to improve matching efficiency. In this paper,
we integrate the concept of feature spatial order into a progressive matching
framework. We use some of the initially matched features to build a
computational model of feature spatial order and employs it to calculates the
possible spatial range of subsequent feature matches, thus filtering out
unnecessary feature matches. We also integrate it with epipolar geometry to
further improve matching efficiency and accuracy. Since the spatial order of
feature points is affected by image rotation, we propose a suitable image
alignment method from the fundamental matrix of epipolar geometry to remove the
effect of image rotation. To verify the feasibility of the proposed method, we
conduct a series of experiments, including a standard benchmark dataset,
self-generated simulated images, and real images. The results demonstrate that
our proposed method is significantly more efficient and has more accurate
feature matching than the traditional method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonoSE(3)-Diffusion is a monocular SE(3) diffusion framework that formulates markerless robot pose estimation as a conditional denoising diffusion process with visibility constraints and timestep-aware refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve markerless, image-based robot pose estimation by addressing limitations of current methods that use fixed-scale perturbations, which lack diversity and may generate out-of-view poses, leading to poor generalization.

Method: Uses a two-process framework: (1) visibility-constrained diffusion process for diverse in-view pose augmentation, and (2) timestep-aware reverse process for progressive pose refinement with coarse-to-fine sampling from diffusion posterior.

Result: Achieves 66.75 AUC on the most challenging DREAM dataset, representing a 32.3% improvement over state-of-the-art methods, with demonstrated improvements across DREAM and RoboKeyGen benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed diffusion framework with visibility constraints and timestep-aware refinement significantly enhances robot pose estimation accuracy and robustness compared to direct prediction methods.

Abstract: We propose MonoSE(3)-Diffusion, a monocular SE(3) diffusion framework that
formulates markerless, image-based robot pose estimation as a conditional
denoising diffusion process. The framework consists of two processes: a
visibility-constrained diffusion process for diverse pose augmentation and a
timestep-aware reverse process for progressive pose refinement. The diffusion
process progressively perturbs ground-truth poses to noisy transformations for
training a pose denoising network. Importantly, we integrate visibility
constraints into the process, ensuring the transformations remain within the
camera field of view. Compared to the fixed-scale perturbations used in current
methods, the diffusion process generates in-view and diverse training poses,
thereby improving the network generalization capability. Furthermore, the
reverse process iteratively predicts the poses by the denoising network and
refines pose estimates by sampling from the diffusion posterior of current
timestep, following a scheduled coarse-to-fine procedure. Moreover, the
timestep indicates the transformation scales, which guide the denoising network
to achieve more accurate pose predictions. The reverse process demonstrates
higher robustness than direct prediction, benefiting from its timestep-aware
refinement scheme. Our approach demonstrates improvements across two benchmarks
(DREAM and RoboKeyGen), achieving a notable AUC of 66.75 on the most
challenging dataset, representing a 32.3% gain over the state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: A multi-modal gait recognition framework combining 2D silhouettes and 3D SMPL features with multitask learning for both identification and human attribute estimation (age, BMI, gender), achieving state-of-the-art performance on challenging datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-modality approaches (2D or 3D alone) fail to capture the full geometric and dynamic complexity of human walking patterns, limiting gait recognition performance in real-world scenarios.

Method: Multi-modal framework combining 2D temporal silhouettes with 3D SMPL features, using unified transformer for feature fusion and multitask learning for joint gait recognition and human attribute estimation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on large-scale BRIAR datasets under challenging conditions (long-range distances up to 1km, extreme pitch angles up to 50°), while providing accurate human attribute estimation.

Conclusion: Multi-modal and multitask learning shows promise for advancing gait-based human understanding in real-world scenarios by capturing comprehensive walking patterns and additional human attributes.

Abstract: Gait recognition is an important biometric for human identification at a
distance, particularly under low-resolution or unconstrained environments.
Current works typically focus on either 2D representations (e.g., silhouettes
and skeletons) or 3D representations (e.g., meshes and SMPLs), but relying on a
single modality often fails to capture the full geometric and dynamic
complexity of human walking patterns. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal
and multi-task framework that combines 2D temporal silhouettes with 3D SMPL
features for robust gait analysis. Beyond identification, we introduce a
multitask learning strategy that jointly performs gait recognition and human
attribute estimation, including age, body mass index (BMI), and gender. A
unified transformer is employed to effectively fuse multi-modal gait features
and better learn attribute-related representations, while preserving
discriminative identity cues. Extensive experiments on the large-scale BRIAR
datasets, collected under challenging conditions such as long-range distances
(up to 1 km) and extreme pitch angles (up to 50{\deg}), demonstrate that our

### [80] [Towards Cybersickness Severity Classification from VR Gameplay Videos Using Transfer Learning and Temporal Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10422)
*Jyotirmay Nag Setu,Kevin Desai,John Quarles*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a video-based deep learning approach using InceptionV3 and LSTM networks to predict cybersickness severity in VR experiences, achieving 68.4% classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cybersickness remains a major barrier to VR adoption, and while multimodal approaches exist, there's limited research on using video-based features for prediction. This study addresses this gap by leveraging temporal video data.

Method: Used transfer learning with InceptionV3 pretrained on ImageNet to extract visual features from VR gameplay videos, then applied LSTM networks to capture temporal dynamics and predict cybersickness severity over time.

Result: Achieved 68.4% classification accuracy for cybersickness severity, surpassing existing video-only models and providing a practical tool for VR developers.

Conclusion: The approach effectively leverages video temporal dynamics for cybersickness prediction and lays foundation for future video-based temporal modeling to enhance user comfort in VR applications.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of virtual reality (VR) technology, its adoption
across domains such as healthcare, education, and entertainment has grown
significantly. However, the persistent issue of cybersickness, marked by
symptoms resembling motion sickness, continues to hinder widespread acceptance
of VR. While recent research has explored multimodal deep learning approaches
leveraging data from integrated VR sensors like eye and head tracking, there
remains limited investigation into the use of video-based features for
predicting cybersickness. In this study, we address this gap by utilizing
transfer learning to extract high-level visual features from VR gameplay videos
using the InceptionV3 model pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. These features
are then passed to a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture the
temporal dynamics of the VR experience and predict cybersickness severity over
time. Our approach effectively leverages the time-series nature of video data,
achieving a 68.4% classification accuracy for cybersickness severity. This
surpasses the performance of existing models trained solely on video data,
providing a practical tool for VR developers to evaluate and mitigate
cybersickness in virtual environments. Furthermore, this work lays the
foundation for future research on video-based temporal modeling for enhancing
user comfort in VR applications.

*Jiahong Chen,Jinghao Wang,Zi Wang,Ziwen Wang,Banglei Guan,Qifeng Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DKPMV is a 6D pose estimation pipeline that uses only multi-view RGB images to achieve dense keypoint-level fusion, outperforming state-of-the-art methods and even RGB-D approaches in most cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-view methods for 6D pose estimation of textureless objects either rely on depth data or insufficiently exploit multi-view geometric cues, limiting performance in industrial robotic applications.

Method: A three-stage progressive pose optimization strategy leveraging dense multi-view keypoint geometry information, with enhanced keypoint network using attentional aggregation and symmetry-aware training to improve accuracy and resolve symmetric object ambiguities.

Result: Extensive experiments on ROBI dataset show DKPMV outperforms state-of-the-art multi-view RGB approaches and surpasses RGB-D methods in most cases.

Conclusion: The proposed DKPMV pipeline effectively addresses 6D pose estimation challenges for textureless objects using only RGB images, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: 6D pose estimation of textureless objects is valuable for industrial robotic
applications, yet remains challenging due to the frequent loss of depth
information. Current multi-view methods either rely on depth data or
insufficiently exploit multi-view geometric cues, limiting their performance.
In this paper, we propose DKPMV, a pipeline that achieves dense keypoint-level
fusion using only multi-view RGB images as input. We design a three-stage
progressive pose optimization strategy that leverages dense multi-view keypoint
geometry information. To enable effective dense keypoint fusion, we enhance the
keypoint network with attentional aggregation and symmetry-aware training,
improving prediction accuracy and resolving ambiguities on symmetric objects.
Extensive experiments on the ROBI dataset demonstrate that DKPMV outperforms
state-of-the-art multi-view RGB approaches and even surpasses the RGB-D methods
in the majority of cases. The code will be available soon.

### [82] [Taming a Retrieval Framework to Read Images in Humanlike Manner for Augmenting Generation of MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10426)
*Suyang Xi,Chenxi Yang,Hong Ding,Yiqing Ni,Catherine C. Liu,Yunhao Liu,Chengqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HuLiRAG is a human-like retrieval-augmented generation framework that improves multimodal reasoning by using a "what-where-reweight" cascade to anchor queries to visual referents, reducing hallucinations in fine-grained visual question answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs often fail in fine-grained visual QA due to hallucinations about object identities, positions, and relations, as textual queries lack explicit visual anchoring. Existing RAG methods focus only on global-level information and lack local detail reasoning.

Method: HuLiRAG stages multimodal reasoning as a "what--where--reweight" cascade: 1) anchor queries to candidate referents via open-vocabulary detection (what), 2) spatially resolve with SAM-derived masks for fine-grained precision (where), 3) adaptively prioritize through local-global alignment trade-off (reweight). Mask-guided fine-tuning injects spatial evidence into generation.

Result: Extensive experiments show the human-like cascade improves grounding fidelity and factual consistency while reducing hallucinations, advancing multimodal QA toward trustworthy reasoning.

Conclusion: HuLiRAG transforms grounding from a passive bias into an explicit constraint on answer formulation, significantly improving multimodal question answering performance and reliability.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often fail in fine-grained visual
question answering, producing hallucinations about object identities,
positions, and relations because textual queries are not explicitly anchored to
visual referents. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) alleviates some errors,
but it fails to align with human-like processing at both the retrieval and
augmentation levels. Specifically, it focuses only on global-level image
information but lacks local detail and limits reasoning about fine-grained
interactions. To overcome this limitation, we present Human-Like
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HuLiRAG), a framework that stages multimodal
reasoning as a ``what--where--reweight'' cascade. Queries are first anchored to
candidate referents via open-vocabulary detection (what), then spatially
resolved with SAM-derived masks to recover fine-grained precision (where), and
adaptively prioritized through the trade-off between local and global alignment
(reweight). Mask-guided fine-tuning further injects spatial evidence into the
generation process, transforming grounding from a passive bias into an explicit
constraint on answer formulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this
human-like cascade improves grounding fidelity and factual consistency while
reducing hallucinations, advancing multimodal question answering toward
trustworthy reasoning.

### [84] [On the Problem of Consistent Anomalies in Zero-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10456)
*Tai Le-Gia,Ahn Jaehyun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoDeGraph is a novel zero-shot anomaly detection method that identifies and filters consistent anomalies (recurring defects) by detecting "neighbor-burnout" patterns in patch similarity graphs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on MVTec AD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing representation-based methods struggle with consistent anomalies - similar defects that recur across multiple images - leading to poor performance in zero-shot anomaly classification and segmentation tasks.

Method: CoDeGraph constructs an image-level graph where images are nodes and edges connect those sharing consistent-anomaly patterns. It detects "neighbor-burnout" - abrupt similarity spikes after exhausting limited similar matches - and uses community detection to filter consistent anomalies.

Result: On MVTec AD with ViT-L-14-336 backbone: 98.3% AUROC for AC, 66.8% F1 (+4.2%) and 68.1% AP (+5.4%) for AS. With DINOv2 backbone: 69.1% F1 (+6.5%) and 71.9% AP (+9.2%) for segmentation.

Conclusion: CoDeGraph effectively addresses the consistent anomaly problem in zero-shot anomaly detection through graph-based filtering of neighbor-burnout patterns, demonstrating robust performance across different backbone architectures.

Abstract: Zero-shot image anomaly classification (AC) and segmentation (AS) are vital
for industrial quality control, detecting defects without prior training data.
Existing representation-based methods compare patch features with nearest
neighbors in unlabeled test images but struggle with consistent anomalies --
similar defects recurring across multiple images -- resulting in poor AC/AS
performance. We introduce Consistent-Anomaly Detection Graph (CoDeGraph), a
novel algorithm that identifies and filters consistent anomalies from
similarity computations. Our key insight is that normal patches in industrial
images show stable, gradually increasing similarity to other test images, while
consistent-anomaly patches exhibit abrupt similarity spikes after exhausting a
limited set of similar matches, a phenomenon we term ``neighbor-burnout.''
CoDeGraph constructs an image-level graph, with images as nodes and edges
connecting those with shared consistent-anomaly patterns, using community
detection to filter these anomalies. We provide a theoretical foundation using
Extreme Value Theory to explain the effectiveness of our approach. Experiments
on MVTec AD with the ViT-L-14-336 backbone achieve 98.3% AUROC for AC and AS
performance of 66.8% (+4.2%) F1 and 68.1% (+5.4%) AP over state-of-the-art
zero-shot methods. Using the DINOv2 backbone further improves segmentation,
yielding 69.1% (+6.5%) F1 and 71.9% (+9.2%) AP, demonstrating robustness across
architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new group decision simulation framework for medical image segmentation that treats expert disagreement as valuable clinical uncertainty rather than noise, achieving state-of-the-art results on CBCT and MRI datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard approaches that average expert labels discard valuable clinical uncertainty revealed in inter-rater variability (IRV) due to differences in annotator expertise and image blurriness.

Method: Uses an Expert Signature Generator (ESG) to learn individual annotator styles in a latent space, and a Simulated Consultation Module (SCM) that intelligently generates final segmentation by sampling from this space to mimic clinical panel decision-making.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging CBCT and MRI datasets with 92.11% and 90.72% Dice scores respectively.

Conclusion: Treating expert disagreement as a useful signal instead of noise provides a clear path toward more robust and trustworthy AI systems for healthcare.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation annotation suffers from inter-rater variability
(IRV) due to differences in annotators' expertise and the inherent blurriness
of medical images. Standard approaches that simply average expert labels are
flawed, as they discard the valuable clinical uncertainty revealed in
disagreements. We introduce a fundamentally new approach with our group
decision simulation framework, which works by mimicking the collaborative
decision-making process of a clinical panel. Under this framework, an Expert
Signature Generator (ESG) learns to represent individual annotator styles in a
unique latent space. A Simulated Consultation Module (SCM) then intelligently
generates the final segmentation by sampling from this space. This method
achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging CBCT and MRI datasets (92.11%
and 90.72% Dice scores). By treating expert disagreement as a useful signal
instead of noise, our work provides a clear path toward more robust and
trustworthy AI systems for healthcare.

*Junhao Dong,Dejia Liu,Ruiqi Ding,Zongxing Chen,Yingjie Huang,Zhu Meng,Jianbo Zhao,Zhicheng Zhao,Fei Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiTIPS is a novel multimodal framework for TIPS prognosis that addresses challenges in ROI annotation, unimodal limitations, and single-endpoint prediction through dual-option segmentation, multimodal interaction, and multi-task prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TIPS procedures have variable survival outcomes and frequent overt hepatic encephalopathy, necessitating accurate preoperative prognostic modeling. Current methods face challenges with labor-intensive ROI annotation, poor reliability of unimodal approaches, and incomplete assessment from single-endpoint prediction.

Method: Three core modules: (1) dual-option segmentation using semi-supervised and foundation model-based pipelines for robust ROI segmentation; (2) multimodal interaction with MGRA, POD, and CGPE techniques for cross-modal feature integration; (3) multi-task prediction with staged training for survival, PPG, and OHE prediction.

Result: Extensive experiments on MultiTIPS dataset demonstrate superiority over state-of-the-art approaches, with strong cross-domain generalization and interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework shows promise for clinical application, providing comprehensive prognostic assessment for TIPS procedures with improved accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is an established
procedure for portal hypertension, but provides variable survival outcomes and
frequent overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE), indicating the necessity of
accurate preoperative prognostic modeling. Current studies typically build
machine learning models from preoperative CT images or clinical
characteristics, but face three key challenges: (1) labor-intensive
region-of-interest (ROI) annotation, (2) poor reliability and generalizability
of unimodal methods, and (3) incomplete assessment from single-endpoint
prediction. Moreover, the lack of publicly accessible datasets constrains
research in this field. Therefore, we present MultiTIPS, the first public
multi-center dataset for TIPS prognosis, and propose a novel multimodal
prognostic framework based on it. The framework comprises three core modules:
(1) dual-option segmentation, which integrates semi-supervised and foundation
model-based pipelines to achieve robust ROI segmentation with limited
annotations and facilitate subsequent feature extraction; (2) multimodal
interaction, where three techniques, multi-grained radiomics attention (MGRA),
progressive orthogonal disentanglement (POD), and clinically guided prognostic
enhancement (CGPE), are introduced to enable cross-modal feature interaction
and complementary representation integration, thus improving model accuracy and
robustness; and (3) multi-task prediction, where a staged training strategy is
used to perform stable optimization of survival, portal pressure gradient
(PPG), and OHE prediction for comprehensive prognostic assessment. Extensive
experiments on MultiTIPS demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method
over state-of-the-art approaches, along with strong cross-domain generalization
and interpretability, indicating its promise for clinical application. The
dataset and code are available.

*Jinjin Cao,Zhiyang Chen,Zijun Wang,Liyuan Ma,Weijian Luo,Guojun Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cross-Modal Guidance (CMG) is a training-free decoding method that reduces hallucinations in Vision-Language Models by leveraging differences between original and degraded visual-language attention distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs suffer from severe hallucinations where they generate fluent but irrelevant responses due to language bias, ignoring visual contexts.

Method: CMG adaptively masks attention weights of influential image tokens in selected transformer layers to corrupt visual-language perception, then uses the difference between original and degraded distributions to emphasize visual context.

Result: CMG significantly reduces language bias and hallucinations without harming VLM capabilities, showing superior performance on hallucination benchmarks with no additional training costs.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free decoding method effectively addresses VLM hallucinations by emphasizing visual perception through controlled attention degradation, generalizing well across different models.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown solid ability for multimodal
understanding of both visual and language contexts. However, existing VLMs
often face severe challenges of hallucinations, meaning that VLMs tend to
generate responses that are only fluent in the language but irrelevant to
images in previous contexts. To address this issue, we analyze how language
bias contributes to hallucinations and then introduce Cross-Modal
Guidance(CMG), a training-free decoding method that addresses the
hallucinations by leveraging the difference between the output distributions of
the original model and the one with degraded visual-language attention. In
practice, we adaptively mask the attention weight of the most influential image
tokens in selected transformer layers to corrupt the visual-language perception
as a concrete type of degradation. Such a degradation-induced decoding
emphasizes the perception of visual contexts and therefore significantly
reduces language bias without harming the ability of VLMs. In experiment
sections, we conduct comprehensive studies. All results demonstrate the
superior advantages of CMG with neither additional conditions nor training
costs. We also quantitatively show CMG can improve different VLM's performance
on hallucination-specific benchmarks and generalize effectively.

*Chuang Chen,Wenyi Ge*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAGLFNet is a pseudo-image-based semantic segmentation framework for LiDAR point clouds that achieves high performance while maintaining real-time capability through global-local feature fusion, multi-branch feature extraction, and deep feature-guided attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pseudo-image-based methods for LiDAR point cloud processing often overlook structural and semantic details, resulting in limited feature fusion and discriminability, which motivates the development of more effective feature extraction approaches.

Method: The framework uses three main components: 1) Global-Local Feature Fusion Encoding to enhance local feature correlations and capture global context, 2) Multi-Branch Feature Extraction to capture neighborhood information and enhance contour feature discriminability, and 3) Feature Fusion via Deep Feature-guided Attention for precise cross-channel feature fusion.

Result: DAGLFNet achieves 69.83% on SemanticKITTI validation set and 78.65% on nuScenes validation set, demonstrating high performance while maintaining real-time capability.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively balances high performance with real-time processing, showing great potential for LiDAR-based real-time applications in autonomous navigation and high-precision mapping.

Abstract: Environmental perception systems play a critical role in high-precision
mapping and autonomous navigation, with LiDAR serving as a core sensor that
provides accurate 3D point cloud data. How to efficiently process unstructured
point clouds while extracting structured semantic information remains a
significant challenge, and in recent years, numerous pseudo-image-based
representation methods have emerged to achieve a balance between efficiency and
performance. However, they often overlook the structural and semantic details
of point clouds, resulting in limited feature fusion and discriminability. In
this work, we propose DAGLFNet, a pseudo-image-based semantic segmentation
framework designed to extract discriminative features. First, the Global-Local
Feature Fusion Encoding module is used to enhance the correlation among local
features within a set and capture global contextual information. Second, the
Multi-Branch Feature Extraction network is employed to capture more
neighborhood information and enhance the discriminability of contour features.
Finally, a Feature Fusion via Deep Feature-guided Attention mechanism is
introduced to improve the precision of cross-channel feature fusion.
Experimental evaluations show that DAGLFNet achieves 69.83\% and 78.65\% on the
validation sets of SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, respectively. The method
balances high performance with real-time capability, demonstrating great
potential for LiDAR-based real-time applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSF-Mamba enhances vanilla Mamba for micro-gesture recognition by adding motion-aware local spatiotemporal modeling through state fusion and multiscale processing, achieving state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vanilla Mamba processes inputs as 1D sequences and lacks local spatiotemporal modeling capabilities, while previous methods lack motion-awareness design crucial for micro-gesture recognition.

Method: Proposed MSF-Mamba with motion-aware state fusion module based on central frame difference, and MSF-Mamba+ with multiscale motion-aware state fusion and adaptive scale weighting module.

Result: Experiments on two public MGR datasets show MSF-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming CNN-, Transformer-, and SSM-based models while maintaining high efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed MSF-Mamba effectively addresses vanilla Mamba's limitations by enabling motion-aware local spatiotemporal modeling, successfully capturing subtle motion cues for micro-gesture recognition.

Abstract: Micro-gesture recognition (MGR) targets the identification of subtle and
fine-grained human motions and requires accurate modeling of both long-range
and local spatiotemporal dependencies. While CNNs are effective at capturing
local patterns, they struggle with long-range dependencies due to their limited
receptive fields. Transformer-based models address this limitation through
self-attention mechanisms but suffer from high computational costs. Recently,
Mamba has shown promise as an efficient model, leveraging state space models
(SSMs) to enable linear-time processing However, directly applying the vanilla
Mamba to MGR may not be optimal. This is because Mamba processes inputs as 1D
sequences, with state updates relying solely on the previous state, and thus
lacks the ability to model local spatiotemporal dependencies. In addition,
previous methods lack a design of motion-awareness, which is crucial in MGR. To
overcome these limitations, we propose motion-aware state fusion mamba
(MSF-Mamba), which enhances Mamba with local spatiotemporal modeling by fusing
local contextual neighboring states. Our design introduces a motion-aware state
fusion module based on central frame difference (CFD). Furthermore, a
multiscale version named MSF-Mamba+ has been proposed. Specifically, MSF-Mamba
supports multiscale motion-aware state fusion, as well as an adaptive scale
weighting module that dynamically weighs the fused states across different
scales. These enhancements explicitly address the limitations of vanilla Mamba
by enabling motion-aware local spatiotemporal modeling, allowing MSF-Mamba and
MSF-Mamba to effectively capture subtle motion cues for MGR. Experiments on two
public MGR datasets demonstrate that even the lightweight version, namely,
MSF-Mamba, achieves SoTA performance, outperforming existing CNN-,
Transformer-, and SSM-based models while maintaining high efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-Language Models can self-refine using a Triangular Consistency framework to generate their own training data without external supervision, achieving autonomous improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the untapped potential of VLMs trained without supervised instruction and validate their inherent self-refinement capabilities for autonomous learning.

Method: Proposed a self-refinement framework based on Triangular Consistency principle with three steps: multi-task instruction tuning, generating image-query-answer triplets from unlabeled images with filtering, and model updating using synthetic data.

Result: Using LLaVA-1.5 as baseline, the model achieved consistent though modest improvements across multiple benchmarks without any external supervision like human annotations or environmental feedback.

Conclusion: VLMs possess inherent self-refinement capabilities that enable autonomous learning, and the insights can inspire future research on VLM learning mechanisms.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) integrate visual knowledge with the analytical
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through supervised visual
instruction tuning, using image-question-answer triplets. However, the
potential of VLMs trained without supervised instruction remains largely
unexplored. This study validates that VLMs possess inherent self-refinement
capabilities, enabling them to generate high-quality supervised data without
external inputs and thereby learn autonomously. Specifically, to stimulate the
self-refinement ability of VLMs, we propose a self-refinement framework based
on a Triangular Consistency principle: within the image-query-answer triangle,
any masked elements should be consistently and accurately reconstructed. The
framework involves three steps: (1) We enable the instruction generation
ability of VLMs by adding multi-task instruction tuning like
image$\rightarrow$question-answer or image-answer$\rightarrow$question. (2) We
generate image-query-answer triplets from unlabeled images and use the
Triangular Consistency principle for filtering. (3) The model is further
updated using the filtered synthetic data. To investigate the underlying
mechanisms behind this self-refinement capability, we conduct a theoretical
analysis from a causal perspective. Using the widely recognized LLaVA-1.5 as
our baseline, our experiments reveal that the model can autonomously achieve
consistent, though deliberately modest, improvements across multiple benchmarks
without any external supervision, such as human annotations or environmental
feedback. We expect that the insights of this study on the self-refinement
ability of VLMs can inspire future research on the learning mechanism of VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HARoPE is a head-wise adaptive extension of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) that addresses limitations in image generation by enabling dynamic frequency reallocation and semantic alignment while preserving RoPE's relative-position property.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard multi-dimensional RoPE has limitations in fine-grained spatial relation modeling, color cues, and object counting for image generation due to rigid frequency allocation, axis-wise independence, and uniform head treatment.

Method: Proposes HARoPE which inserts a learnable linear transformation parameterized via singular value decomposition (SVD) before the rotary mapping, enabling dynamic frequency reallocation, semantic alignment of rotary planes, and head-specific positional receptive fields.

Result: Extensive experiments on class-conditional ImageNet and text-to-image generation (Flux and MMDiT) show consistent performance improvements over strong RoPE baselines and other extensions.

Conclusion: HARoPE serves as an effective drop-in replacement that offers a principled and adaptable solution for enhancing positional awareness in transformer-based image generative models.

Abstract: Transformers rely on explicit positional encoding to model structure in data.
While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) excels in 1D domains, its application to
image generation reveals significant limitations such as fine-grained spatial
relation modeling, color cues, and object counting. This paper identifies key
limitations of standard multi-dimensional RoPE-rigid frequency allocation,
axis-wise independence, and uniform head treatment-in capturing the complex
structural biases required for fine-grained image generation. We propose
HARoPE, a head-wise adaptive extension that inserts a learnable linear
transformation parameterized via singular value decomposition (SVD) before the
rotary mapping. This lightweight modification enables dynamic frequency
reallocation, semantic alignment of rotary planes, and head-specific positional
receptive fields while rigorously preserving RoPE's relative-position property.
Extensive experiments on class-conditional ImageNet and text-to-image
generation (Flux and MMDiT) demonstrate that HARoPE consistently improves
performance over strong RoPE baselines and other extensions. The method serves
as an effective drop-in replacement, offering a principled and adaptable

*Yuteng Ye,Zheng Zhang,Qinchuan Zhang,Di Wang,Youjia Zhang,Wenxiao Zhang,Wei Yang,Yuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Jigsaw3D is a fast 3D style transfer method that uses jigsaw operations to isolate style from content and integrates it into multi-view diffusion models for view-consistent stylization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D style transfer methods either rely on direct style token injection or score-distillation from 2D diffusion models, which require heavy per-scene optimization and often entangle style with semantic content.

Method: The method uses jigsaw operations (spatial shuffling and random masking of reference patches) to suppress object semantics and isolate stylistic statistics. These style cues are integrated into a multi-view diffusion model via reference-to-view cross-attention to produce view-consistent stylized renderings, which are then style-baked onto the surface.

Result: Jigsaw3D achieves high style fidelity and multi-view consistency with substantially lower latency compared to existing methods, and generalizes to masked partial reference stylization, multi-object scene styling, and tileable texture generation.

Conclusion: Jigsaw3D provides an effective solution for fast, view-consistent 3D style transfer that decouples style from content through jigsaw operations and multi-view diffusion integration.

Abstract: Controllable 3D style transfer seeks to restyle a 3D asset so that its
textures match a reference image while preserving the integrity and multi-view
consistency. The prevalent methods either rely on direct reference style token
injection or score-distillation from 2D diffusion models, which incurs heavy
per-scene optimization and often entangles style with semantic content. We
introduce Jigsaw3D, a multi-view diffusion based pipeline that decouples style
from content and enables fast, view-consistent stylization. Our key idea is to
leverage the jigsaw operation - spatial shuffling and random masking of
reference patches - to suppress object semantics and isolate stylistic
statistics (color palettes, strokes, textures). We integrate these style cues
into a multi-view diffusion model via reference-to-view cross-attention,
producing view-consistent stylized renderings conditioned on the input mesh.
The renders are then style-baked onto the surface to yield seamless textures.
Across standard 3D stylization benchmarks, Jigsaw3D achieves high style
fidelity and multi-view consistency with substantially lower latency, and
generalizes to masked partial reference stylization, multi-object scene
styling, and tileable texture generation. Project page is available at:

*Qunzhong Wang,Jie Liu,Jiajun Liang,Yilei Jiang,Yuanxing Zhang,Jinyuan Chen,Yaozhi Zheng,Xintao Wang,Pengfei Wan,Xiangyu Yue,Jiaheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VR-Thinker is a thinking-with-image framework that enhances multimodal reward models by enabling active visual reasoning operations and configurable visual memory, achieving state-of-the-art performance on video preference benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal reward models face limitations: visual inputs consume large context budgets (forcing fewer frames and losing details) and packing all visual information into initial prompts causes hallucination and forgetting during reasoning.

Method: Introduces VR-Thinker with visual reasoning operations (e.g., select frame) and configurable visual memory window. Uses three-stage pipeline: (1) Cold Start with visual chain-of-thought data, (2) Rejection sampling Fine-Tuning on high-quality traces, and (3) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen reasoning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among open-source models: 80.5% on VideoGen Reward, 82.3% on GenAI-Bench, and 75.6% on MJ-Bench-Video with a 7B model, especially effective for longer videos.

Conclusion: The thinking-with-image approach effectively addresses limitations of current multimodal reward models and shows promise for improving reasoning fidelity and reliability in visual generative model post-training.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal reward models (RMs) have substantially
improved post-training for visual generative models. However, current RMs face
inherent limitations: (1) visual inputs consume large context budgets, forcing
fewer frames and causing loss of fine-grained details; and (2) all visual
information is packed into the initial prompt, exacerbating hallucination and
forgetting during chain-of-thought reasoning. To overcome these issues, we
introduce VideoReward Thinker (VR-Thinker), a thinking-with-image framework
that equips the RM with visual reasoning operations (e.g., select frame) and a
configurable visual memory window. This allows the RM to actively acquire and
update visual evidence within context limits, improving reasoning fidelity and
reliability. We activate visual reasoning via a reinforcement fine-tuning
pipeline: (i) Cold Start with curated visual chain-of-thought data to distill
basic reasoning skills and operation formatting; (ii) select samples whose
per-dimension and overall judgments are all correct, then conduct Rejection
sampling Fine-Tuning on these high-quality traces to further enhance reasoning;
and (iii) apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen
reasoning. Our approach delivers state-of-the-art accuracy among open-source
models on video preference benchmarks, especially for longer videos: a 7B
VR-Thinker achieves 80.5% on VideoGen Reward, 82.3% on GenAI-Bench, and 75.6%
on MJ-Bench-Video. These results validate the effectiveness and promise of
thinking-with-image multimodal reward modeling.

### [94] [Receptive Field Expanded Look-Up Tables for Vision Inference: Advancing from Low-level to High-level Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10522)
*Xi Zhang,Xiaolin Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes novel techniques to expand CNN receptive fields in LUT-based inference methods while maintaining fixed table size, including adaptive lattice vector quantization, irregular dilated convolutions, and U-shaped cascaded LUT structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LUT methods for CNN inference suffer from limited receptive field due to combinatorial explosion of table size, which restricts their performance despite offering speed advantages.

Method: Proposes learning an optimal lattice vector quantizer for adaptive resolution allocation, uses irregular dilated convolutions, and implements a U-shaped cascaded LUT structure to capture multi-level contextual information.

Result: The approach effectively balances speed, accuracy and memory efficiency, demonstrating significant improvements over existing LUT methods while maintaining the same space complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed innovations enable expanded CNN receptive fields with fixed table size, enhancing LUT-driven fast CNN inference performance through better approximation of kernels and multi-level context capture.

Abstract: Recently, several look-up table (LUT) methods were developed to greatly
expedite the inference of CNNs in a classical strategy of trading space for
speed. However, these LUT methods suffer from a common drawback of limited
receptive field of the convolution kernels due to the combinatorial explosion
of table size. This research aims to expand the CNN receptive field with a
fixed table size, thereby enhancing the performance of LUT-driven fast CNN
inference while maintaining the same space complexity. To achieve this goal,
various techniques are proposed. The main contribution is a novel approach of
learning an optimal lattice vector quantizer that adaptively allocates the
quantization resolution across data dimensions based on their significance to
the inference task. In addition, the lattice vector quantizer offers an
inherently more accurate approximation of CNN kernels than scalar quantizer as
used in current practice. Furthermore, we introduce other receptive field
expansion strategies, including irregular dilated convolutions and a U-shaped
cascaded LUT structure, designed to capture multi-level contextual information
without inflating table size. Together, these innovations allow our approach to
effectively balance speed, accuracy, and memory efficiency, demonstrating
significant improvements over existing LUT methods.

Abstract: In this work, we present COSINE, a unified open-world segmentation model that
consolidates open-vocabulary segmentation and in-context segmentation with
multi-modal prompts (e.g., text and image). COSINE exploits foundation models
to extract representations for an input image and corresponding multi-modal
prompts, and a SegDecoder to align these representations, model their
interaction, and obtain masks specified by input prompts across different
granularities. In this way, COSINE overcomes architectural discrepancies,
divergent learning objectives, and distinct representation learning strategies
of previous pipelines for open-vocabulary segmentation and in-context
segmentation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that COSINE has significant
performance improvements in both open-vocabulary and in-context segmentation
tasks. Our exploratory analyses highlight that the synergistic collaboration
between using visual and textual prompts leads to significantly improved
generalization over single-modality approaches.

identification and post-OCR refinement in a seamless process, learning the
structural patterns and formatting rules specific to license plates without
relying on explicit heuristic corrections or manual layout classification.
Through this design, the system jointly optimizes visual and linguistic cues,
enables iterative refinement to improve OCR accuracy under noise, distortion,
and unconventional fonts, and achieves layout-independent recognition across
multiple international datasets (IR-LPR, UFPR-ALPR, AOLP). Experimental results
demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to recent
segmentation-free approaches, highlighting how embedding pattern analysis
within the recognition stage bridges computer vision and language modelling for
enhanced adaptability in intelligent transportation and surveillance
applications.

*Binyu Zhao,Wei Zhang,Zhaonian Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCE addresses imbalanced missing modalities in multi-modal learning through two components: LCE for dynamic learning balance and RCE for feature enhancement, achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to handle sample-level modality utility variations and degraded feature quality caused by imbalanced missing rates, creating a vicious cycle where high-missing-rate modalities receive fewer updates.

Method: Proposes Modality Capability Enhancement (MCE) with: 1) Learning Capability Enhancement (LCE) using multi-level factors to dynamically balance modality learning progress, and 2) Representation Capability Enhancement (RCE) using subset prediction and cross-modal completion to improve feature semantics and robustness.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on four multi-modal benchmarks show MCE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods under various missing configurations.

Conclusion: MCE effectively addresses the challenges of imbalanced missing modalities through synergistic learning and representation enhancement components, demonstrating superior performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Multi-modal learning has made significant advances across diverse pattern
recognition applications. However, handling missing modalities, especially
under imbalanced missing rates, remains a major challenge. This imbalance
triggers a vicious cycle: modalities with higher missing rates receive fewer
updates, leading to inconsistent learning progress and representational
degradation that further diminishes their contribution. Existing methods
typically focus on global dataset-level balancing, often overlooking critical
sample-level variations in modality utility and the underlying issue of
degraded feature quality. We propose Modality Capability Enhancement (MCE) to
tackle these limitations. MCE includes two synergistic components: i) Learning
Capability Enhancement (LCE), which introduces multi-level factors to
dynamically balance modality-specific learning progress, and ii) Representation
Capability Enhancement (RCE), which improves feature semantics and robustness
through subset prediction and cross-modal completion tasks. Comprehensive
evaluations on four multi-modal benchmarks show that MCE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods under various missing configurations. The

TL;DR: GLOFNet is a multimodal dataset for predicting Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) that integrates Sentinel-2 imagery, glacier velocity data, and temperature records from the Shisper Glacier region.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GLOFs are destructive but rare hazards in high mountains, and current research is limited by fragmented, unimodal data that focuses mainly on post-event mapping rather than forecasting.

Method: The dataset combines three data sources: Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery for spatial monitoring, NASA ITS_LIVE velocity products for glacier kinematics, and MODIS Land Surface Temperature records. Preprocessing included cloud masking, quality filtering, normalization, temporal interpolation, augmentation, and cyclical encoding.

Result: Exploratory analysis revealed seasonal glacier velocity cycles, long-term warming of ~0.8 K per decade, and spatial heterogeneity in cryospheric conditions. The dataset addresses challenges like class imbalance, cloud contamination, and coarse resolution.

Conclusion: GLOFNet provides a structured, publicly available foundation for benchmarking multimodal deep learning approaches to rare hazard prediction, supporting future research in glacial hazard forecasting.

Abstract: Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) are rare but destructive hazards in high
mountain regions, yet predictive research is hindered by fragmented and
unimodal data. Most prior efforts emphasize post-event mapping, whereas
forecasting requires harmonized datasets that combine visual indicators with
physical precursors. We present GLOFNet, a multimodal dataset for GLOF
monitoring and prediction, focused on the Shisper Glacier in the Karakoram. It
integrates three complementary sources: Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery for
spatial monitoring, NASA ITS_LIVE velocity products for glacier kinematics, and
MODIS Land Surface Temperature records spanning over two decades. Preprocessing
included cloud masking, quality filtering, normalization, temporal
interpolation, augmentation, and cyclical encoding, followed by harmonization
across modalities. Exploratory analysis reveals seasonal glacier velocity
cycles, long-term warming of ~0.8 K per decade, and spatial heterogeneity in
cryospheric conditions. The resulting dataset, GLOFNet, is publicly available
to support future research in glacial hazard prediction. By addressing
challenges such as class imbalance, cloud contamination, and coarse resolution,
GLOFNet provides a structured foundation for benchmarking multimodal deep
learning approaches to rare hazard prediction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MRS-YOLO is an improved YOLO11-based algorithm for railway transmission line foreign object detection that enhances detection accuracy while reducing computational complexity through multi-scale feature fusion, re-calibration pyramid network, spatial-channel reconstruction detection head, and channel pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address problems of missed detection, false detection, and low detection efficiency in transmission line foreign object detection under railway environments.

Method: Proposed MAKDF module for multi-scale feature extraction, RCFPN neck structure for feature integration, SC_Detect head for spatial and channel preprocessing, and channel pruning for model compression.

Result: Achieved mAP50 of 94.8% and mAP50:95 of 86.4%, with 44.2% reduction in parameters and 17.5% reduction in GFLOPs compared to baseline.

Conclusion: The improved algorithm demonstrates superior performance and efficiency for railway transmission line foreign object detection tasks.

Abstract: Aiming at the problems of missed detection, false detection and low detection
efficiency in transmission line foreign object detection under railway
environment, we proposed an improved algorithm MRS-YOLO based on YOLO11.
Firstly, a multi-scale Adaptive Kernel Depth Feature Fusion (MAKDF) module is
proposed and fused with the C3k2 module to form C3k2_MAKDF, which enhances the
model's feature extraction capability for foreign objects of different sizes
and shapes. Secondly, a novel Re-calibration Feature Fusion Pyramid Network
(RCFPN) is designed as a neck structure to enhance the model's ability to
integrate and utilize multi-level features effectively. Then, Spatial and
Channel Reconstruction Detect Head (SC_Detect) based on spatial and channel
preprocessing is designed to enhance the model's overall detection performance.
Finally, the channel pruning technique is used to reduce the redundancy of the
improved model, drastically reduce Parameters and Giga Floating Point
Operations Per Second (GFLOPs), and improve the detection efficiency. The
experimental results show that the mAP50 and mAP50:95 of the MRS-YOLO algorithm
proposed in this paper are improved to 94.8% and 86.4%, respectively, which are
0.7 and 2.3 percentage points higher compared to the baseline, while Parameters
and GFLOPs are reduced by 44.2% and 17.5%, respectively. It is demonstrated
that the improved algorithm can be better applied to the task of foreign object
detection in railroad transmission lines.

*Farouq Benchallal,Adel Hafiane,Nicolas Ragot,Raphael Canals*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep semi-supervised approach combining consistency regularization with similarity learning for weed species classification, achieving robust performance with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weed classification is challenging due to similarities with crops and field condition variations. Deep learning requires large annotated datasets, but data labeling is time-consuming and laborious in agricultural applications, creating a need to better utilize unlabeled data.

Method: Proposed a deep semi-supervised approach that combines consistency regularization with similarity learning using a developed deep auto-encoder architecture.

Result: Experiments on DeepWeeds dataset and inference in noisy conditions demonstrated effectiveness and robustness compared to state-of-the-art fully supervised deep learning models. Ablation studies provided extended analysis of the joint learning strategy.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully improves utilization of unlabeled data and provides robust classification performance under conditions of limited labeled data availability during learning.

Abstract: Weed species classification represents an important step for the development
of automated targeting systems that allow the adoption of precision agriculture
practices. To reduce costs and yield losses caused by their presence. The
identification of weeds is a challenging problem due to their shared
similarities with crop plants and the variability related to the differences in
terms of their types. Along with the variations in relation to changes in field
conditions. Moreover, to fully benefit from deep learning-based methods, large
fully annotated datasets are needed. This requires time intensive and laborious
process for data labeling, which represents a limitation in agricultural
applications. Hence, for the aim of improving the utilization of the unlabeled
data, regarding conditions of scarcity in terms of the labeled data available
during the learning phase and provide robust and high classification
performance. We propose a deep semi-supervised approach, that combines
consistency regularization with similarity learning. Through our developed deep
auto-encoder architecture, experiments realized on the DeepWeeds dataset and
inference in noisy conditions demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of
our method in comparison to state-of-the-art fully supervised deep learning
models. Furthermore, we carried out ablation studies for an extended analysis
of our proposed joint learning strategy.

### [101] [UniFlow: A Unified Pixel Flow Tokenizer for Visual Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10575)
*Zhengrong Yue,Haiyu Zhang,Xiangyu Zeng,Boyu Chen,Chenting Wang,Shaobin Zhuang,Lu Dong,KunPeng Du,Yi Wang,Limin Wang,Yali Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniFlow is a unified tokenizer that addresses the performance trade-off between visual understanding and generation by using layer-wise adaptive self-distillation and a lightweight patch-wise pixel flow decoder, achieving superior results across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tokenizers face a significant performance trade-off between understanding and generation due to the inherent conflict between high-level semantic abstraction and low-level pixel reconstruction. The goal is to develop a universal tokenizer that can handle both tasks effectively.

Method: UniFlow adapts any visual encoder with a reconstruction decoder using layer-wise adaptive self-distillation to inherit semantic features for understanding while adapting to fine-grained details for generation. It employs a lightweight patch-wise pixel flow decoder that models conditional flow from noisy state to pixel domain, using semantic features as visual conditions to alleviate training conflicts.

Result: Extensive experiments across 13 benchmarks and 7 visual tasks show UniFlow achieves win-win outcomes. The 7B UniFlow-XL surpasses 14B TokenFlow-XL by 7.75% on understanding benchmarks and achieves competitive results in visual reconstruction and generation, outperforming UniTok by 0.15 in rFID and 0.09 in gFID.

Conclusion: UniFlow successfully addresses the performance trade-off between visual understanding and generation through its innovative architecture, demonstrating that unified tokenization can achieve superior performance in both domains simultaneously.

Abstract: Tokenizer is a crucial component for both visual understanding and
generation. To advance toward the ultimate goal of universal modeling, recent
research has focused on developing a unified tokenizer. However, existing
tokenizers face a significant performance trade-off between understanding and
generation, stemming from the inherent conflict between high-level semantic
abstraction and low-level pixel reconstruction. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a generic and unified tokenizer, namely UniFlow, by flexibly adapting
any visual encoder with a concise reconstruction decoder. Specifically, we
introduce layer-wise adaptive self-distillation applied to the well-pretrained
visual encoders, which enables UniFlow to simultaneously inherit the strong
semantic features for visual understanding and flexibly adapt to model
fine-grained details for visual generation. Moreover, we propose a lightweight
patch-wise pixel flow decoder, which efficiently achieves high-fidelity pixel
reconstruction by modeling a conditional flow from the noisy state back to the
patch-wise pixel domain. By leveraging the semantic features as visual
conditions for the decoder, we effectively alleviate the training conflicts
between understanding and generation. Furthermore, the patch-wise learning
strategy simplifies the data distribution, thereby improving training
efficiency. Extensive experiments across 13 challenging benchmarks spanning 7
widely studied visual understanding and generation tasks demonstrate that
UniFlow achieves a win-win outcome. For instance, our 7B UniFlow-XL not only
surpasses the 14B TokenFlow-XL by 7.75% on average understanding benchmarks,
but also achieves competitive results in both visual reconstruction and
generation, surpassing UniTok by 0.15 in rFID and 0.09 in gFID (without
guidance), respectively.

### [102] [Injecting Frame-Event Complementary Fusion into Diffusion for Optical Flow in Challenging Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10577)
*Haonan Wang,Hanyu Zhou,Haoyue Liu,Luxin Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diff-ABFlow is a novel optical flow estimation framework that uses diffusion models with frame-event appearance-boundary fusion to address challenges in high-speed and low-light scenes where traditional methods fail due to motion blur and insufficient illumination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional optical flow methods struggle in high-speed and low-light scenes due to motion blur and insufficient illumination, which weaken texture, amplify noise, and deteriorate appearance saturation and boundary completeness. Frame cameras provide dense appearance but sparse boundaries, while event cameras offer sparse appearance but dense boundaries.

Method: The proposed Diff-ABFlow framework uses diffusion models that learn the mapping from noisy flow to clear flow, combined with frame-event appearance-boundary fusion. This approach is not affected by deteriorated visual features that plague traditional discriminative and generative models.

Result: The method overcomes limitations of existing approaches that rely on feature fusion or domain adaptation but still suffer from deteriorated appearance features that affect motion estimation.

Conclusion: By leveraging diffusion models and frame-event fusion, Diff-ABFlow provides a robust solution for optical flow estimation in challenging conditions where conventional methods fail, particularly in high-speed and low-light scenarios.

Abstract: Optical flow estimation has achieved promising results in conventional scenes
but faces challenges in high-speed and low-light scenes, which suffer from
motion blur and insufficient illumination. These conditions lead to weakened
texture and amplified noise and deteriorate the appearance saturation and
boundary completeness of frame cameras, which are necessary for motion feature
matching. In degraded scenes, the frame camera provides dense appearance
saturation but sparse boundary completeness due to its long imaging time and
low dynamic range. In contrast, the event camera offers sparse appearance
saturation, while its short imaging time and high dynamic range gives rise to
dense boundary completeness. Traditionally, existing methods utilize feature
fusion or domain adaptation to introduce event to improve boundary
completeness. However, the appearance features are still deteriorated, which
severely affects the mostly adopted discriminative models that learn the
mapping from visual features to motion fields and generative models that
generate motion fields based on given visual features. So we introduce
diffusion models that learn the mapping from noising flow to clear flow, which
is not affected by the deteriorated visual features. Therefore, we propose a
novel optical flow estimation framework Diff-ABFlow based on diffusion models
with frame-event appearance-boundary fusion.

*Shizhen Zhao,Jiahui Liu,Xin Wen,Haoru Tan,Xiaojuan Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pre-trained vision foundation models like DINOv2 show strong potential for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection without fine-tuning, but struggle with large semantic spaces. The paper proposes Mixture of Feature Experts (MoFE) and Dynamic-β Mixup to address this limitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision foundation models have shown strong feature learning capabilities but their impact on OOD detection remains underexplored. The authors aim to systematically investigate these models for OOD detection and address their limitations in large semantic spaces.

Method: 1) Systematically evaluate pre-trained vision foundation models for OOD detection; 2) Propose Mixture of Feature Experts (MoFE) module to partition features into subspaces for better decision boundaries; 3) Introduce Dynamic-β Mixup strategy with adaptive interpolation weights to handle varying learning difficulties across categories.

Result: Pre-trained DINOv2 without fine-tuning achieves OOD detection performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods. The proposed MoFE and Dynamic-β Mixup significantly outperform baseline methods, especially in scenarios with large semantic spaces.

Conclusion: Vision foundation models provide strong baseline for OOD detection, and the proposed MoFE with Dynamic-β Mixup effectively addresses their limitations in large semantic spaces, achieving superior performance through better feature partitioning and adaptive learning strategies.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision foundation models have transformed many computer vision
tasks. Despite their strong ability to learn discriminative and generalizable
features crucial for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, their impact on this
task remains underexplored. Motivated by this gap, we systematically
investigate representative vision foundation models for OOD detection. Our
findings reveal that a pre-trained DINOv2 model, even without fine-tuning on
in-domain (ID) data, naturally provides a highly discriminative feature space
for OOD detection, achieving performance comparable to existing
state-of-the-art methods without requiring complex designs. Beyond this, we
explore how fine-tuning foundation models on in-domain (ID) data can enhance
OOD detection. However, we observe that the performance of vision foundation
models remains unsatisfactory in scenarios with a large semantic space. This is
due to the increased complexity of decision boundaries as the number of
categories grows, which complicates the optimization process. To mitigate this,
we propose the Mixture of Feature Experts (MoFE) module, which partitions
features into subspaces, effectively capturing complex data distributions and
refining decision boundaries. Further, we introduce a Dynamic-$\beta$ Mixup
strategy, which samples interpolation weights from a dynamic beta distribution.
This adapts to varying levels of learning difficulty across categories,
improving feature learning for more challenging categories. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, significantly
outperforming baseline methods.

### [104] [A Simple and Better Baseline for Visual Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10587)
*Jingchao Wang,Wenlong Zhang,Dingjiang Huang,Hong Wang,Yefeng Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSVG is a simple yet effective visual grounding method that directly integrates linguistic and visual modalities without iterative procedures, using language-guided feature selection to reduce computational overhead while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual grounding methods that focus on selecting linguistic-relevant visual regions require iterative procedures across different image scales and cache storage, incurring extra computational overhead that complicates implementation.

Method: FSVG encapsulates linguistic and visual modalities into a unified network without iterative procedures, uses language as parallel guidance for modality interaction, and employs a similarity-based feature selection mechanism to exploit only language-related visual features for faster prediction.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that FSVG achieves better balance between accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: FSVG provides an effective baseline for visual grounding that simplifies implementation while maintaining competitive performance through direct modality integration and efficient feature selection.

Abstract: Visual grounding aims to predict the locations of target objects specified by
textual descriptions. For this task with linguistic and visual modalities,
there is a latest research line that focuses on only selecting the
linguistic-relevant visual regions for object localization to reduce the
computational overhead. Albeit achieving impressive performance, it is
iteratively performed on different image scales, and at every iteration,
linguistic features and visual features need to be stored in a cache, incurring
extra overhead. To facilitate the implementation, in this paper, we propose a
feature selection-based simple yet effective baseline for visual grounding,
called FSVG. Specifically, we directly encapsulate the linguistic and visual
modalities into an overall network architecture without complicated iterative
procedures, and utilize the language in parallel as guidance to facilitate the
interaction between linguistic modal and visual modal for extracting effective
visual features. Furthermore, to reduce the computational cost, during the
visual feature learning, we introduce a similarity-based feature selection
mechanism to only exploit language-related visual features for faster
prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets
comprehensively substantiate that the proposed FSVG achieves a better balance
between accuracy and efficiency beyond the current state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViSurf is a unified post-training paradigm that combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) in a single stage to address their individual limitations in training Large Vision-and-Language Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SFT often leads to sub-optimal performance while RLVR struggles with tasks beyond the model's internal knowledge. The authors aim to create a unified approach that leverages the strengths of both methods.

Method: ViSurf integrates SFT and RLVR by injecting ground-truth labels into RLVR rollouts, providing simultaneous external supervision and internal reinforcement. It also introduces three novel reward control strategies to stabilize training.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks show ViSurf outperforms individual SFT, RLVR, and two-stage SFT→RLVR approaches.

Conclusion: ViSurf provides an effective unified post-training paradigm that successfully combines the benefits of both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, validated through comprehensive analysis.

Abstract: Typical post-training paradigms for Large Vision-and-Language Models (LVLMs)
include Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR). SFT leverages external guidance to inject new knowledge,
whereas RLVR utilizes internal reinforcement to enhance reasoning capabilities
and overall performance. However, our analysis reveals that SFT often leads to
sub-optimal performance, while RLVR struggles with tasks that exceed the
model's internal knowledge base. To address these limitations, we propose
ViSurf (\textbf{Vi}sual \textbf{Su}pervised-and-\textbf{R}einforcement
\textbf{F}ine-Tuning), a unified post-training paradigm that integrates the
strengths of both SFT and RLVR within a single stage. We analyze the derivation
of the SFT and RLVR objectives to establish the ViSurf objective, providing a
unified perspective on these two paradigms. The core of ViSurf involves
injecting ground-truth labels into the RLVR rollouts, thereby providing
simultaneous external supervision and internal reinforcement. Furthermore, we
introduce three novel reward control strategies to stabilize and optimize the
training process. Extensive experiments across several diverse benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of ViSurf, outperforming both individual SFT,
RLVR, and two-stage SFT \textrightarrow RLVR. In-depth analysis corroborates
these findings, validating the derivation and design principles of ViSurf.

TL;DR: OmniQuality-R is a unified reward modeling framework that transforms multi-task quality reasoning into continuous and interpretable reward signals for policy optimization across various image quality assessment tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual evaluation approaches are typically constrained to a single task, lacking a unified framework for multi-task quality assessment.

Method: The framework constructs a reasoning-enhanced reward modeling dataset via rejection sampling, uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with Gaussian-based rewards, and incorporates STD filtering and entropy gating mechanisms to stabilize training.

Result: The method is evaluated on three key IQA tasks: aesthetic quality assessment, technical quality evaluation, and text-image alignment.

Conclusion: OmniQuality-R provides a structured approach to multi-dimensional quality reasoning with continuous and interpretable reward signals for improved policy optimization.

Abstract: Current visual evaluation approaches are typically constrained to a single
task. To address this, we propose OmniQuality-R, a unified reward modeling
framework that transforms multi-task quality reasoning into continuous and
interpretable reward signals for policy optimization. Inspired by subjective
experiments, where participants are given task-specific instructions outlining
distinct assessment principles prior to evaluation, we propose OmniQuality-R, a
structured reward modeling framework that transforms multi-dimensional
reasoning into continuous and interpretable reward signals. To enable this, we
construct a reasoning-enhanced reward modeling dataset by sampling informative
plan-reason trajectories via rejection sampling, forming a reliable
chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Building on
this, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for post-training,
using a Gaussian-based reward to support continuous score prediction. To
further stabilize the training and improve downstream generalization, we
incorporate standard deviation (STD) filtering and entropy gating mechanisms
during reinforcement learning. These techniques suppress unstable updates and
reduce variance in policy optimization. We evaluate OmniQuality-R on three key
IQA tasks: aesthetic quality assessment, technical quality evaluation, and
text-image alignment.

### [107] [GraphTARIF: Linear Graph Transformer with Augmented Rank and Improved Focus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10631)
*Zhaolin Hu,Kun Li,Hehe Fan,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a hybrid framework that enhances linear attention in Graph Transformers by increasing attention rank through gated local graph networks and sharpening focus using learnable log-power functions, achieving competitive performance while maintaining scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear attention mechanisms in Graph Transformers offer efficiency but suffer from reduced expressiveness due to low-rank projections and uniform attention distributions, which limit class separability and classification performance.

Method: Enhances linear attention by: 1) attaching a gated local graph network branch to the value matrix to increase attention map rank, and 2) introducing a learnable log-power function to reduce attention entropy and sharpen focus.

Result: Extensive experiments on homophilic and heterophilic graph benchmarks show the method achieves competitive performance while preserving the scalability benefits of linear attention.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid framework successfully addresses the expressiveness limitations of linear attention in Graph Transformers by enhancing both rank and focus, maintaining efficiency while improving classification performance across diverse graph types.

Abstract: Linear attention mechanisms have emerged as efficient alternatives to full
self-attention in Graph Transformers, offering linear time complexity. However,
existing linear attention models often suffer from a significant drop in
expressiveness due to low-rank projection structures and overly uniform
attention distributions. We theoretically prove that these properties reduce
the class separability of node representations, limiting the model's
classification ability. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid framework
that enhances both the rank and focus of attention. Specifically, we enhance
linear attention by attaching a gated local graph network branch to the value
matrix, thereby increasing the rank of the resulting attention map.
Furthermore, to alleviate the excessive smoothing effect inherent in linear
attention, we introduce a learnable log-power function into the attention
scores to reduce entropy and sharpen focus. We theoretically show that this
function decreases entropy in the attention distribution, enhancing the
separability of learned embeddings. Extensive experiments on both homophilic
and heterophilic graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance while preserving the scalability of linear attention.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEMO is a flow-matching framework for audio-driven talking-portrait synthesis that provides disentangled control over lip motion, head pose, and eye gaze using a motion auto-encoder and transformer-based flow matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based methods struggle with temporal coherence and fine-grained motion control in talking-head generation, motivating the need for better disentangled control mechanisms.

Method: Uses a motion auto-encoder to create a structured latent space with orthogonalized motion factors, combined with optimal-transport-based flow matching and transformer predictor for smooth motion trajectory generation conditioned on audio.

Result: Outperforms prior methods in video realism, lip-audio synchronization, and motion fidelity across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Combining fine-grained motion disentanglement with flow-based generative modeling provides a powerful new paradigm for controllable talking-head video synthesis.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking-head generation has advanced rapidly with
diffusion-based generative models, yet producing temporally coherent videos
with fine-grained motion control remains challenging. We propose DEMO, a
flow-matching generative framework for audio-driven talking-portrait video
synthesis that delivers disentangled, high-fidelity control of lip motion, head
pose, and eye gaze. The core contribution is a motion auto-encoder that builds
a structured latent space in which motion factors are independently represented
and approximately orthogonalized. On this disentangled motion space, we apply
optimal-transport-based flow matching with a transformer predictor to generate
temporally smooth motion trajectories conditioned on audio. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks show that DEMO outperforms prior methods
in video realism, lip-audio synchronization, and motion fidelity. These results
demonstrate that combining fine-grained motion disentanglement with flow-based
generative modeling provides a powerful new paradigm for controllable
talking-head video synthesis.

*Gaojian Wang,Feng Lin,Tong Wu,Zhisheng Yan,Kui Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FS-VFM is a self-supervised pre-training framework that learns robust facial representations by combining masked image modeling and instance discrimination through three learning objectives (3C), enabling strong generalization across face security tasks like deepfake detection and face anti-spoofing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To learn robust and transferable facial representations from abundant unlabeled real face images that can generalize well across various face security tasks, addressing the need for fundamental face representations without task-specific supervision.

Method: Proposes FS-VFM with three learning objectives (3C): uses masked image modeling with facial masking strategies (including CRFR-P masking) for intra-region consistency and inter-region coherency, and couples MIM with instance discrimination via self-distillation for local-to-global correspondence. Also introduces FS-Adapter for efficient transfer learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on 11 benchmarks show FS-VFM consistently outperforms diverse vision foundation models across natural and facial domains, various supervision paradigms, and ViT scales. It even beats state-of-the-art task-specific methods while FS-Adapter provides excellent efficiency-performance trade-off.

Conclusion: FS-VFM successfully learns fundamental facial representations through self-supervised pre-training that generalize well across multiple face security tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining masked image modeling and instance discrimination with the proposed 3C learning objectives.

Abstract: With abundant, unlabeled real faces, how can we learn robust and transferable
facial representations to boost generalization across various face security
tasks? We make the first attempt and propose FS-VFM, a scalable self-supervised
pre-training framework, to learn fundamental representations of real face
images. We introduce three learning objectives, namely 3C, that synergize
masked image modeling (MIM) and instance discrimination (ID), empowering FS-VFM
to encode both local patterns and global semantics of real faces. Specifically,
we formulate various facial masking strategies for MIM and devise a simple yet
effective CRFR-P masking, which explicitly prompts the model to pursue
meaningful intra-region Consistency and challenging inter-region Coherency. We
present a reliable self-distillation mechanism that seamlessly couples MIM with
ID to establish underlying local-to-global Correspondence. After pre-training,
vanilla vision transformers (ViTs) serve as universal Vision Foundation Models
for downstream Face Security tasks: cross-dataset deepfake detection,
cross-domain face anti-spoofing, and unseen diffusion facial forensics. To
efficiently transfer the pre-trained FS-VFM, we further propose FS-Adapter, a
lightweight plug-and-play bottleneck atop the frozen backbone with a novel
real-anchor contrastive objective. Extensive experiments on 11 public
benchmarks demonstrate that our FS-VFM consistently generalizes better than
diverse VFMs, spanning natural and facial domains, fully, weakly, and
self-supervised paradigms, small, base, and large ViT scales, and even
outperforms SOTA task-specific methods, while FS-Adapter offers an excellent
efficiency-performance trade-off. The code and models are available on

*Sebastian Schmidt,Julius Körner,Stephan Günnemann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel ML approach for corner case recognition in autonomous driving that considers underlying data distribution, unifying existing taxonomies and achieving strong detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional corner case categorization in autonomous driving is not scalable and lacks data coverage perspective, neglecting generalization to ML model training data.

Method: A framework for corner case recognition that takes underlying data distribution into account, extending established out-of-distribution detection benchmarks and introducing fog-augmented Lost & Found dataset.

Result: The approach (i) unifies existing scenario-based corner case taxonomies, (ii) achieves strong corner case detection performance across standard benchmarks, and (iii) enables analysis of combined corner cases.

Conclusion: Provides a principled basis for corner case recognition with a manual specification-free definition, offering a scalable and data-driven approach for safe autonomous driving.

Abstract: For high-stakes applications, like autonomous driving, a safe operation is
necessary to prevent harm, accidents, and failures. Traditionally, difficult
scenarios have been categorized into corner cases and addressed individually.
However, this example-based categorization is not scalable and lacks a data
coverage perspective, neglecting the generalization to training data of machine
learning models. In our work, we propose a novel machine learning approach that
takes the underlying data distribution into account. Based on our novel
perspective, we present a framework for effective corner case recognition for
perception on individual samples. In our evaluation, we show that our approach
(i) unifies existing scenario-based corner case taxonomies under a
distributional perspective, (ii) achieves strong performance on corner case
detection tasks across standard benchmarks for which we extend established
out-of-distribution detection benchmarks, and (iii) enables analysis of
combined corner cases via a newly introduced fog-augmented Lost & Found
dataset. These results provide a principled basis for corner case recognition,
underlining our manual specification-free definition.

TL;DR: This survey provides the first comprehensive review of image-to-video transfer learning, where image-language foundation models are extended to video domains to reduce data and computational requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To alleviate the substantial data and computational requirements of training video-language foundation models from scratch by leveraging existing image-language foundation models through transfer learning.

Method: Systematically classifies image-to-video transfer learning strategies into two categories: frozen features (preserving original representations) and modified features (undergoing modifications), and analyzes their applications across various video-text learning tasks.

Result: Presents experimental analysis investigating the efficacy of different image-to-video transfer learning paradigms on downstream video understanding tasks, establishing a structured roadmap for advancing video-text learning.

Conclusion: Identifies prevailing challenges and highlights promising directions for future research in this rapidly evolving domain of image-to-video transfer learning for video-text understanding.

Abstract: Image-Language Foundation Models (ILFM) have demonstrated remarkable success
in image-text understanding/generation tasks, providing transferable multimodal
representations that generalize across diverse downstream image-based tasks.
The advancement of video-text research has spurred growing interest in
extending image-based models to the video domain. This paradigm, known as
image-to-video transfer learning, succeeds in alleviating the substantial data
and computational requirements associated with training video-language
foundation models from scratch for video-text learning. This survey provides
the first comprehensive review of this emerging field, which begins by
summarizing the widely used ILFM and their capabilities. We then systematically
classify existing image-to-video transfer learning strategies into two
categories: frozen features and modified features, depending on whether the
original representations from ILFM are preserved or undergo modifications.
Building upon the task-specific nature of image-to-video transfer, this survey
methodically elaborates these strategies and details their applications across
a spectrum of video-text learning tasks, ranging from fine-grained (e.g.,
spatio-temporal video grounding) to coarse-grained (e.g., video question
answering). We further present a detailed experimental analysis to investigate
the efficacy of different image-to-video transfer learning paradigms on a range
of downstream video understanding tasks. Finally, we identify prevailing
challenges and highlight promising directions for future research. By offering
a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to establish a
structured roadmap for advancing video-text learning based on existing ILFM,
and to inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain.

*Hao Shan,Ruikai Li,Han Jiang,Yizhe Fan,Ziyang Yan,Bohan Li,Xiaoshuai Hao,Hao Zhao,Zhiyong Cui,Yilong Ren,Haiyang Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating temporal stability in online HD mapping models for autonomous driving, proposing a multi-dimensional stability evaluation framework with novel metrics and a unified mAS score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing online map construction models prioritize mapping accuracy but ignore temporal stability, which is crucial for autonomous driving in dynamic environments where sensor displacement causes mapping shifts that challenge downstream tasks.

Method: Proposed a multi-dimensional stability evaluation framework with novel metrics for Presence, Localization, and Shape Stability, integrated into a unified mean Average Stability (mAS) score. Conducted extensive experiments on 42 models and variants.

Result: Experiments revealed that accuracy (mAP) and stability (mAS) represent largely independent performance dimensions. Identified architectural and training factors that contribute to high accuracy, high stability, or both.

Conclusion: Temporal stability should be treated as a core evaluation criterion alongside accuracy for online HD mapping models. The work advances the development of more reliable autonomous driving systems and provides a public benchmark for broader focus on stability.

Abstract: As one of the fundamental modules in autonomous driving, online
high-definition (HD) maps have attracted significant attention due to their
cost-effectiveness and real-time capabilities. Since vehicles always cruise in
highly dynamic environments, spatial displacement of onboard sensors inevitably
causes shifts in real-time HD mapping results, and such instability poses
fundamental challenges for downstream tasks. However, existing online map
construction models tend to prioritize improving each frame's mapping accuracy,
while the mapping stability has not yet been systematically studied. To fill
this gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
the temporal stability of online HD mapping models. We propose a
multi-dimensional stability evaluation framework with novel metrics for
Presence, Localization, and Shape Stability, integrated into a unified mean
Average Stability (mAS) score. Extensive experiments on 42 models and variants
show that accuracy (mAP) and stability (mAS) represent largely independent
performance dimensions. We further analyze the impact of key model design
choices on both criteria, identifying architectural and training factors that
contribute to high accuracy, high stability, or both. To encourage broader
focus on stability, we will release a public benchmark. Our work highlights the
importance of treating temporal stability as a core evaluation criterion
alongside accuracy, advancing the development of more reliable autonomous
driving systems. The benchmark toolkit, code, and models will be available at
https://stablehdmap.github.io/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DISC-GAN integrates style-content disentanglement with cluster-specific training for photorealistic underwater image synthesis, achieving state-of-the-art performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater image quality is challenged by optical phenomena like color attenuation and turbidity, which create distinct stylistic variations across different waterbodies. Generative models often lack the ability to model non-uniform conditions of diverse underwater environments.

Method: Uses K-means clustering to partition dataset into style-specific domains, employs separate encoders for style and content latent spaces, integrates these via Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN), and decodes to produce synthetic images. The model is trained independently on each style cluster to preserve domain-specific characteristics.

Result: Achieved Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.9012, average Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 32.5118 dB, and Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 13.3728, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The proposed DISC-GAN framework successfully addresses the challenges of underwater image synthesis through style-content disentanglement and cluster-specific training, producing high-quality synthetic underwater images that capture domain-specific characteristics.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Disentangled Style-Content GAN
(DISC-GAN), which integrates style-content disentanglement with a
cluster-specific training strategy towards photorealistic underwater image
synthesis. The quality of synthetic underwater images is challenged by optical
due to phenomena such as color attenuation and turbidity. These phenomena are
represented by distinct stylistic variations across different waterbodies, such
as changes in tint and haze. While generative models are well-suited to capture
complex patterns, they often lack the ability to model the non-uniform
conditions of diverse underwater environments. To address these challenges, we
employ K-means clustering to partition a dataset into style-specific domains.
We use separate encoders to get latent spaces for style and content; we further
integrate these latent representations via Adaptive Instance Normalization
(AdaIN) and decode the result to produce the final synthetic image. The model
is trained independently on each style cluster to preserve domain-specific
characteristics. Our framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance,
obtaining a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.9012, an average Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 32.5118 dB, and a Frechet Inception Distance
(FID) of 13.3728.

Motivation: Clouds significantly obstruct optical satellite imagery analysis for environmental monitoring, land cover mapping, and climate research, requiring robust cloud segmentation methods.

Method: Combines Swin Transformer backbone with multi-scale context modules (ASPP and PSP), cross-attention for multisensor fusion, and attention blocks (ECAB and Spatial Attention) for feature refinement.

Conclusion: MSCloudCAM is effective and practical for large-scale Earth observation tasks, making it suitable for real-world applications in satellite imagery analysis.

Abstract: Clouds remain a critical challenge in optical satellite imagery, hindering
reliable analysis for environmental monitoring, land cover mapping, and climate
research. To overcome this, we propose MSCloudCAM, a Cross-Attention with
Multi-Scale Context Network tailored for multispectral and multi-sensor cloud
segmentation. Our framework exploits the spectral richness of Sentinel-2
(CloudSEN12) and Landsat-8 (L8Biome) data to classify four semantic categories:
clear sky, thin cloud, thick cloud, and cloud shadow. MSCloudCAM combines a
Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical feature extraction with multi-scale
context modules ASPP and PSP for enhanced scale-aware learning. A
Cross-Attention block enables effective multisensor and multispectral feature
fusion, while the integration of an Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB)
and a Spatial Attention Module adaptively refine feature representations.
Comprehensive experiments on CloudSEN12 and L8Biome demonstrate that MSCloudCAM
delivers state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy, surpassing leading baseline
architectures while maintaining competitive parameter efficiency and FLOPs.
These results underscore the model's effectiveness and practicality, making it
well-suited for large-scale Earth observation tasks and real-world

TL;DR: The paper proposes adapting pre-trained Text-to-Video (T2V) models for viewpoint planning from 4D scenes using a two-stage approach that injects 4D scene representation and formulates viewpoint extraction as camera extrinsic denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the powerful visual simulation capabilities of T2V models as implicit world models for viewpoint planning, since videos naturally accompany dynamic scenes with viewpoints.

Method: Two-stage paradigm: 1) Inject 4D scene representation into pre-trained T2V model via adaptive learning branch; 2) Formulate viewpoint extraction as hybrid-condition guided camera extrinsic denoising process using a camera extrinsic diffusion branch.

Result: Experimental results show superiority over existing competitors, and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of key technical designs.

Conclusion: This work proves the potential of video generation models toward 4D interaction in the real world.

Abstract: Recent Text-to-Video (T2V) models have demonstrated powerful capability in
visual simulation of real-world geometry and physical laws, indicating its
potential as implicit world models. Inspired by this, we explore the
feasibility of leveraging the video generation prior for viewpoint planning
from given 4D scenes, since videos internally accompany dynamic scenes with
natural viewpoints. To this end, we propose a two-stage paradigm to adapt
pre-trained T2V models for viewpoint prediction, in a compatible manner. First,
we inject the 4D scene representation into the pre-trained T2V model via an
adaptive learning branch, where the 4D scene is viewpoint-agnostic and the
conditional generated video embeds the viewpoints visually. Then, we formulate
viewpoint extraction as a hybrid-condition guided camera extrinsic denoising
process. Specifically, a camera extrinsic diffusion branch is further
introduced onto the pre-trained T2V model, by taking the generated video and 4D
scene as input. Experimental results show the superiority of our proposed
method over existing competitors, and ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of our key technical designs. To some extent, this work proves
the potential of video generation models toward 4D interaction in real world.

TL;DR: A framework combining CNN-XGBoost pipeline with active learning reduces demographic bias in chest X-ray diagnosis while maintaining performance, offering computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for chest X-ray diagnosis risk perpetuating healthcare disparities when performance varies across demographic groups (sex, age, race).

Method: Extend CNN-XGBoost pipeline for multi-label classification, replace CNN final layer with XGBoost classifier, and combine with active learning. Compare with adversarial training, reweighting, data augmentation.

Result: XGBoost replacement improves fairness across subgroups while maintaining or improving overall performance. Combined with active learning yields largest bias reduction across all demographic subgroups on CheXpert and MIMIC datasets.

Conclusion: The approach establishes a practical and effective path toward equitable deep learning deployment in clinical radiology, offering competitive bias reduction at low computational cost.

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown promise in improving diagnostic accuracy from
chest X-rays, but they also risk perpetuating healthcare disparities when
performance varies across demographic groups. In this work, we present a
comprehensive bias detection and mitigation framework targeting sex, age, and
race-based disparities when performing diagnostic tasks with chest X-rays. We
extend a recent CNN-XGBoost pipeline to support multi-label classification and
evaluate its performance across four medical conditions. We show that replacing
the final layer of CNN with an eXtreme Gradient Boosting classifier improves
the fairness of the subgroup while maintaining or improving the overall
predictive performance. To validate its generalizability, we apply the method
to different backbones, namely DenseNet-121 and ResNet-50, and achieve
similarly strong performance and fairness outcomes, confirming its
model-agnostic design. We further compare this lightweight adapter training
method with traditional full-model training bias mitigation techniques,
including adversarial training, reweighting, data augmentation, and active
learning, and find that our approach offers competitive or superior bias
reduction at a fraction of the computational cost. Finally, we show that
combining eXtreme Gradient Boosting retraining with active learning yields the
largest reduction in bias across all demographic subgroups, both in and out of
distribution on the CheXpert and MIMIC datasets, establishing a practical and
effective path toward equitable deep learning deployment in clinical radiology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSM-Seg is a novel framework for multi-modal brain tumor segmentation that introduces a dual-memory paradigm integrating multi-modal and inter-slice information with category-agnostic prompts, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt-based segmentation methods ignore cross-modal correlations and rely on labor-intensive category-specific prompts, limiting real-world applicability in clinical brain tumor diagnosis.

Method: Proposes MSM-Seg with three key components: modality-and-slice memory attention (MSMA) for cross-modal and inter-slice relationships, multi-scale category-agnostic prompt encoder (MCP-Encoder) for tumor guidance, and modality-adaptive fusion decoder (MF-Decoder) for complementary information fusion.

Result: Extensive experiments on different MRI datasets demonstrate that MSM-Seg outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both multi-modal metastases and glioma tumor segmentation.

Conclusion: The MSM-Seg framework provides an effective solution for multi-modal brain tumor segmentation by synergistically integrating multi-modal and inter-slice information with efficient category-agnostic prompts, showing superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Multi-modal brain tumor segmentation is critical for clinical diagnosis, and
it requires accurate identification of distinct internal anatomical subregions.
While the recent prompt-based segmentation paradigms enable interactive
experiences for clinicians, existing methods ignore cross-modal correlations
and rely on labor-intensive category-specific prompts, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a
MSM-Seg framework for multi-modal brain tumor segmentation. The MSM-Seg
introduces a novel dual-memory segmentation paradigm that synergistically
integrates multi-modal and inter-slice information with the efficient
category-agnostic prompt for brain tumor understanding. To this end, we first
devise a modality-and-slice memory attention (MSMA) to exploit the cross-modal
and inter-slice relationships among the input scans. Then, we propose a
multi-scale category-agnostic prompt encoder (MCP-Encoder) to provide tumor
region guidance for decoding. Moreover, we devise a modality-adaptive fusion
decoder (MF-Decoder) that leverages the complementary decoding information
across different modalities to improve segmentation accuracy. Extensive
experiments on different MRI datasets demonstrate that our MSM-Seg framework
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-modal metastases and glioma tumor
segmentation. The code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/MSM-Seg.

*Junwon You,Dasol Kang,Jae-Hun Jung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ToMCLIP introduces topological alignment to improve multilingual CLIP models by preserving global geometry in embedding spaces, enhancing zero-shot accuracy and multilingual retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multilingual VLMs have biased cross-modal alignment toward English and neglect global geometry of shared embedding spaces, limiting their effectiveness across languages.

Method: Proposes ToMCLIP framework with topology-preserving constraints using persistent homology to define topological alignment loss, and approximates persistence diagrams with theoretical error bounds via graph sparsification.

Result: Enhanced structural coherence of multilingual representations, higher zero-shot accuracy on CIFAR-100, and stronger multilingual retrieval performance on xFlickr&CO dataset.

Conclusion: The approach provides a general method for incorporating topological alignment into representation learning beyond just vision-language models.

Abstract: Contrastive Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot
capabilities. However, their cross-modal alignment remains biased toward
English due to limited multilingual multimodal data. Recent multilingual
extensions have alleviated this gap but enforce instance-level alignment while
neglecting the global geometry of the shared embedding space. We address this
problem by introducing ToMCLIP (Topological Alignment for Multilingual CLIP), a
topology-aware framework aligning embedding spaces with topology-preserving
constraints. The proposed method applies persistent homology to define a
topological alignment loss and approximates persistence diagram with
theoretical error bounds using graph sparsification strategy. This work
validates the proposed approach, showing enhanced structural coherence of
multilingual representations, higher zero-shot accuracy on the CIFAR-100, and
stronger multilingual retrieval performance on the xFlickr&CO. Beyond VLMs, the
proposed approach provides a general method for incorporating topological
alignment into representation learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a State-Specific Model (SSM) framework that unifies action detection and anticipation by compressing video sequences into critical states, modeling action dynamics through state-transition graphs, and using cross-temporal interactions to refine features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Untrimmed videos contain redundant information and noise, and current approaches often overlook the influence of agent intention on actions. The authors aim to address these limitations in action understanding.

Method: Three key modules: 1) Critical State-Based Memory Compression to reduce redundancy, 2) Action Pattern Learning with state-transition graphs to model action dynamics and generate future cues, 3) Cross-Temporal Interaction module to model mutual influence between intentions and past/current information.

Result: Extensive experiments on EPIC-Kitchens-100, THUMOS'14, TVSeries, and PDMB datasets demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The framework highlights the importance of action dynamics learning and cross-temporal interactions, providing a foundation for future action understanding research.

Abstract: Action understanding, encompassing action detection and anticipation, plays a
crucial role in numerous practical applications. However, untrimmed videos are
often characterized by substantial redundant information and noise. Moreover,
in modeling action understanding, the influence of the agent's intention on the
action is often overlooked. Motivated by these issues, we propose a novel
framework called the State-Specific Model (SSM), designed to unify and enhance
both action detection and anticipation tasks. In the proposed framework, the
Critical State-Based Memory Compression module compresses frame sequences into
critical states, reducing information redundancy. The Action Pattern Learning
module constructs a state-transition graph with multi-dimensional edges to
model action dynamics in complex scenarios, on the basis of which potential
future cues can be generated to represent intention. Furthermore, our
Cross-Temporal Interaction module models the mutual influence between
intentions and past as well as current information through cross-temporal
interactions, thereby refining present and future features and ultimately
realizing simultaneous action detection and anticipation. Extensive experiments
on multiple benchmark datasets -- including EPIC-Kitchens-100, THUMOS'14,
TVSeries, and the introduced Parkinson's Disease Mouse Behaviour (PDMB) dataset
-- demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed framework compared to
other state-of-the-art approaches. These results highlight the importance of
action dynamics learning and cross-temporal interactions, laying a foundation
for future action understanding research.

### [121] [Dynamic Gaussian Splatting from Defocused and Motion-blurred Monocular Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10691)
*Xuankai Zhang,Junjin Xiao,Qing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified framework for high-quality dynamic Gaussian Splatting from defocused and motion-blurred monocular videos, overcoming limitations of existing methods that handle only one type of blur.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods are specialized for either defocus blur or motion blur, lacking the ability to handle both simultaneously. Joint modeling as blur kernel convolution faces challenges in estimating accurate blur kernels.

Method: Proposes a blur prediction network for per-pixel reliable blur kernels using blur-related scene and camera information with blur-aware sparsity constraint. Introduces dynamic Gaussian densification for incomplete regions and incorporates unseen view information for scene optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating photorealistic novel view synthesis from defocused and motion-blurred monocular videos.

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework successfully handles both defocus and motion blur in dynamic Gaussian Splatting, achieving superior novel view synthesis quality compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework that allows high-quality dynamic
Gaussian Splatting from both defocused and motion-blurred monocular videos. Due
to the significant difference between the formation processes of defocus blur
and motion blur, existing methods are tailored for either one of them, lacking
the ability to simultaneously deal with both of them. Although the two can be
jointly modeled as blur kernel-based convolution, the inherent difficulty in
estimating accurate blur kernels greatly limits the progress in this direction.
In this work, we go a step further towards this direction. Particularly, we
propose to estimate per-pixel reliable blur kernels using a blur prediction
network that exploits blur-related scene and camera information and is subject
to a blur-aware sparsity constraint. Besides, we introduce a dynamic Gaussian
densification strategy to mitigate the lack of Gaussians for incomplete
regions, and boost the performance of novel view synthesis by incorporating
unseen view information to constrain scene optimization. Extensive experiments
show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in generating
photorealistic novel view synthesis from defocused and motion-blurred monocular
videos. Our code and trained model will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models like CLIP struggle with fine-grained details in object attributes, spatial relations, and linguistic expressions, with limited bilingual comprehension capabilities, particularly for Chinese.

Method: Leverages fine-grained supervision including region-text matching and long-caption modeling, introduces Textual Intra-modal Contrastive (TIC) loss to distinguish semantically similar captions, and trains on large-scale English and Chinese data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on 29 datasets across 8 tasks, outperforming existing methods in both English and Chinese, and introduces a new benchmark for Chinese multimodal understanding.

Conclusion: FG-CLIP 2 successfully addresses fine-grained bilingual vision-language alignment challenges and provides a foundation for future research through released model, code, and benchmark.

Abstract: Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires precise alignment between
visual content and linguistic descriptions, a capability that remains limited
in current models, particularly in non-English settings. While models like CLIP
perform well on global alignment, they often struggle to capture fine-grained
details in object attributes, spatial relations, and linguistic expressions,
with limited support for bilingual comprehension. To address these challenges,
we introduce FG-CLIP 2, a bilingual vision-language model designed to advance
fine-grained alignment for both English and Chinese. Our approach leverages
rich fine-grained supervision, including region-text matching and long-caption
modeling, alongside multiple discriminative objectives. We further introduce
the Textual Intra-modal Contrastive (TIC) loss to better distinguish
semantically similar captions. Trained on a carefully curated mixture of
large-scale English and Chinese data, FG-CLIP 2 achieves powerful bilingual
performance. To enable rigorous evaluation, we present a new benchmark for
Chinese multimodal understanding, featuring long-caption retrieval and bounding
box classification. Extensive experiments on 29 datasets across 8 tasks show
that FG-CLIP 2 outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results
in both languages. We release the model, code, and benchmark to facilitate
future research on bilingual fine-grained alignment.

Abstract: With the recent emergence of revolutionary autonomous agentic systems,
research community is witnessing a significant shift from traditional static,
passive, and domain-specific AI agents toward more dynamic, proactive, and
generalizable agentic AI. Motivated by the growing interest in agentic AI and
its potential trajectory toward AGI, we present a comprehensive survey on
Agentic Multimodal Large Language Models (Agentic MLLMs). In this survey, we
explore the emerging paradigm of agentic MLLMs, delineating their conceptual
foundations and distinguishing characteristics from conventional MLLM-based
agents. We establish a conceptual framework that organizes agentic MLLMs along
three fundamental dimensions: (i) Agentic internal intelligence functions as
the system's commander, enabling accurate long-horizon planning through
reasoning, reflection, and memory; (ii) Agentic external tool invocation,
whereby models proactively use various external tools to extend their
problem-solving capabilities beyond their intrinsic knowledge; and (iii)
Agentic environment interaction further situates models within virtual or
physical environments, allowing them to take actions, adapt strategies, and
sustain goal-directed behavior in dynamic real-world scenarios. To further
accelerate research in this area for the community, we compile open-source
training frameworks, training and evaluation datasets for developing agentic
MLLMs. Finally, we review the downstream applications of agentic MLLMs and
outline future research directions for this rapidly evolving field. To
continuously track developments in this rapidly evolving field, we will also
actively update a public repository at

*Yuan Xu,Zimu Zhang,Xiaoxuan Ma,Wentao Zhu,Yu Qiao,Yizhou Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hierarchical intention-aware framework using cognitive mechanisms and dynamic GCN to predict human situated behaviors (gaze, interactions) in VR/AR environments, enabling proactive adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VR/AR systems need intelligent adaptation to user behaviors for enhanced interaction, requiring accurate understanding of human intentions and prediction of situated behaviors like gaze direction and object interactions.

Method: Hierarchical framework that first identifies interaction targets, then forecasts fine-grained behaviors using dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to capture human-environment relationships from historical dynamics and scene contexts.

Result: Superior performance across all metrics on real-world benchmarks and live VR environments, demonstrating effectiveness for practical applications.

Conclusion: The framework enables proactive VR systems that anticipate user behaviors and adapt virtual environments accordingly, advancing intelligent VR/AR interaction experiences.

Abstract: Virtual and augmented reality systems increasingly demand intelligent
adaptation to user behaviors for enhanced interaction experiences. Achieving
this requires accurately understanding human intentions and predicting future
situated behaviors - such as gaze direction and object interactions - which is
vital for creating responsive VR/AR environments and applications like
personalized assistants. However, accurate behavioral prediction demands
modeling the underlying cognitive processes that drive human-environment
interactions. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical, intention-aware
framework that models human intentions and predicts detailed situated behaviors
by leveraging cognitive mechanisms. Given historical human dynamics and the
observation of scene contexts, our framework first identifies potential
interaction targets and forecasts fine-grained future behaviors. We propose a
dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to effectively capture
human-environment relationships. Extensive experiments on challenging
real-world benchmarks and live VR environment demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, achieving superior performance across all metrics and enabling
practical applications for proactive VR systems that anticipate user behaviors
and adapt virtual environments accordingly.

TL;DR: AURA is the first multi-annotator benchmark dataset for underwater visual anomaly detection (VAD) using deep neural networks to automatically identify interesting events in marine biodiversity monitoring videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual inspection of vast volumes of underwater video footage for marine biodiversity assessment is highly impractical, requiring automated methods to identify anomalous events.

Method: Introduced AURA benchmark dataset with multiple annotators, evaluated four VAD models across two marine scenes, and emphasized robust frame selection strategies for meaningful video segment extraction.

Result: VAD performance varies dramatically across models, is highly sensitive to training data amount and visual content variability defining "normal" scenes, and benefits from soft and consensus labels.

Conclusion: The approach offers practical support for scientific exploration and scalable biodiversity monitoring through automated anomaly detection in underwater videos.

Abstract: Underwater video monitoring is a promising strategy for assessing marine
biodiversity, but the vast volume of uneventful footage makes manual inspection
highly impractical. In this work, we explore the use of visual anomaly
detection (VAD) based on deep neural networks to automatically identify
interesting or anomalous events. We introduce AURA, the first multi-annotator
benchmark dataset for underwater VAD, and evaluate four VAD models across two
marine scenes. We demonstrate the importance of robust frame selection
strategies to extract meaningful video segments. Our comparison against
multiple annotators reveals that VAD performance of current models varies
dramatically and is highly sensitive to both the amount of training data and
the variability in visual content that defines "normal" scenes. Our results
highlight the value of soft and consensus labels and offer a practical approach
for supporting scientific exploration and scalable biodiversity monitoring.

### [127] [GeoVLMath: Enhancing Geometry Reasoning in Vision-Language Models via Cross-Modal Reward for Auxiliary Line Creation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11020)
*Shasha Guo,Liang Pang,Xi Wang,Yanling Wang,Huawei Shen,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes GeoVLMath, an LVLM that uses reinforcement learning with cross-modal rewards to generate textual descriptions of auxiliary lines for solving geometry problems, achieving competitive performance on auxiliary-line reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Auxiliary lines are crucial for complex geometry problems but current LVLMs struggle with them. Image editing models lack geometric precision for drawing auxiliary lines, so textual descriptions better align with LVLM capabilities.

Method: Propose a reinforcement learning framework with cross-modal reward that evaluates alignment between generated auxiliary-line descriptions and ground-truth diagrams. Use GRPO-based RL for precise diagram-text alignment. Create AuxSolidMath dataset with 3,018 geometry problems.

Result: GeoVLMath at 3B and 7B scales achieves competitive and often superior performance compared to strong open-source and proprietary LVLMs on auxiliary-line reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Textual descriptions of auxiliary lines combined with reinforcement learning and cross-modal rewards effectively enhance LVLM performance on geometric reasoning tasks, providing a better approach than direct diagram editing.

Abstract: Auxiliary lines are essential for solving complex geometric problems but
remain challenging for large vision-language models (LVLMs). Rather than
editing diagrams to draw auxiliary lines, which current image editing models
struggle to render with geometric precision, we generate textual descriptions
of auxiliary-line constructions to better align with the representational
strengths of LVLMs. To bridge the gap between textual descriptions and spatial
structure, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that enhances
diagram-text alignment. At the core of our approach is a cross-modal reward
that evaluates how well the generated auxiliary-line description for an
original diagram matches a ground-truth auxiliary-line diagram. Built on this
reward, we present GeoVLMath, an open-source LVLM tailored to auxiliary-line
reasoning in solid geometry. This fine-grained signal drives a GRPO-based RL
stage, yielding precise diagram-text alignment. To support training, we develop
a scalable data creation pipeline and construct AuxSolidMath, a dataset of
3,018 real-exam geometry problems with paired diagrams and aligned textual
fields. At the 3B and 7B scales, GeoVLMath achieves competitive and often
superior performance compared with strong open-source and proprietary LVLMs on
auxiliary-line reasoning benchmarks.

*Kagan Ozturk,Aman Bhatta,Haiyu Wu,Patrick Flynn,Kevin W. Bowyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an inherently interpretable face similarity metric that breaks down global similarity into patch-level contributions, providing local explanations without post-hoc analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current post-hoc interpretability methods for deep neural networks have uncertain fidelity to the actual model reasoning due to lack of reliable evaluation metrics, motivating the need for inherently interpretable models.

Method: Design a face similarity metric that defines similarity between two face images as the sum of patch-level similarity scores from restricted receptive fields, providing locally additive explanations.

Result: The method achieves competitive verification performance with 28x28 patches in 112x112 face images, and surpasses state-of-the-art methods when using 56x56 patches.

Conclusion: The proposed inherently interpretable approach provides transparent decision processes while maintaining competitive performance, offering a viable alternative to post-hoc explanation methods.

Abstract: Understanding how deep neural networks make decisions is crucial for
analyzing their behavior and diagnosing failure cases. In computer vision, a
common approach to improve interpretability is to assign importance to
individual pixels using post-hoc methods. Although they are widely used to
explain black-box models, their fidelity to the model's actual reasoning is
uncertain due to the lack of reliable evaluation metrics. This limitation
motivates an alternative approach, which is to design models whose decision
processes are inherently interpretable. To this end, we propose a face
similarity metric that breaks down global similarity into contributions from
restricted receptive fields. Our method defines the similarity between two face
images as the sum of patch-level similarity scores, providing a locally
additive explanation without relying on post-hoc analysis. We show that the
proposed approach achieves competitive verification performance even with
patches as small as 28x28 within 112x112 face images, and surpasses
state-of-the-art methods when using 56x56 patches.

combining both. The combined model achieved the best accuracy and reliability
while running fast enough for real-time use on common GPUs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A graph-based framework for multi-label classification of 3D Chest CT scans that represents CT volumes as structured graphs with axial slice triplets as nodes, using spectral graph convolution to capture inter-slice dependencies while maintaining clinical deployment feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing CT examination volume creates demand for automated tools to support radiologists. Multi-label classification of 3D Chest CT is challenging due to complex spatial relationships and abnormality variability. Existing 3D CNNs struggle with long-range dependencies, while Vision Transformers require extensive domain-specific pre-training.

Method: Proposes a 2.5D graph-based framework representing 3D CT volumes as structured graphs where axial slice triplets serve as nodes processed through spectral graph convolution, enabling reasoning over inter-slice dependencies with clinical deployment-compatible complexity.

Result: Achieves strong cross-dataset generalization across 3 independent institution datasets, shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art visual encoders. Comprehensive ablation studies evaluate aggregation strategies, edge-weighting schemes, and graph connectivity patterns. Demonstrates broader applicability through transfer experiments on radiology report generation and abdominal CT data.

Conclusion: The graph-based framework provides an effective alternative to 3D CNNs and Vision Transformers for multi-label CT classification, offering strong generalization capabilities and clinical deployment feasibility while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: With the growing volume of CT examinations, there is an increasing demand for
automated tools such as organ segmentation, abnormality detection, and report
generation to support radiologists in managing their clinical workload.
Multi-label classification of 3D Chest CT scans remains a critical yet
challenging problem due to the complex spatial relationships inherent in
volumetric data and the wide variability of abnormalities. Existing methods
based on 3D convolutional neural networks struggle to capture long-range
dependencies, while Vision Transformers often require extensive pre-training on
large-scale, domain-specific datasets to perform competitively. In this work,
we propose a 2.5D alternative by introducing a new graph-based framework that
represents 3D CT volumes as structured graphs, where axial slice triplets serve
as nodes processed through spectral graph convolution, enabling the model to
reason over inter-slice dependencies while maintaining complexity compatible
with clinical deployment. Our method, trained and evaluated on 3 datasets from
independent institutions, achieves strong cross-dataset generalization, and
shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art visual encoders. We
further conduct comprehensive ablation studies to evaluate the impact of
various aggregation strategies, edge-weighting schemes, and graph connectivity
patterns. Additionally, we demonstrate the broader applicability of our
approach through transfer experiments on automated radiology report generation
and abdominal CT data.\\ This work extends our previous contribution presented
at the MICCAI 2025 EMERGE Workshop.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FRANCK is a novel Source-Free Object Detection framework specifically designed for DETR models, featuring objectness-based sample reweighting, contrastive learning with memory banks, uncertainty-weighted feature distillation, and improved self-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SFOD approaches are either limited to conventional object detection models like Faster R-CNN or not tailored for novel architectures like DETR, creating a need for specialized solutions for transformer-based detectors.

Method: FRANCK uses four key components: Objectness Score-based Sample Reweighting (OSSR) for attention-based loss reweighting, Contrastive Learning with Matching-based Memory Bank (CMMB) for class-wise feature enhancement, Uncertainty-weighted Query-fused Feature Distillation (UQFD) for improved feature transfer, and Dynamic Teacher Updating Interval (DTUI) for better pseudo-label quality.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that FRANCK achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating enhanced robustness and generalization for DETR-based SFOD models.

Conclusion: FRANCK effectively adapts source-pre-trained DETR models to target domains with superior performance, highlighting its effectiveness and compatibility with transformer-based object detection architectures.

Abstract: Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) enables knowledge transfer from a source
domain to an unsupervised target domain for object detection without access to
source data. Most existing SFOD approaches are either confined to conventional
object detection (OD) models like Faster R-CNN or designed as general solutions
without tailored adaptations for novel OD architectures, especially Detection
Transformer (DETR). In this paper, we introduce Feature Reweighting ANd
Contrastive Learning NetworK (FRANCK), a novel SFOD framework specifically
designed to perform query-centric feature enhancement for DETRs. FRANCK
comprises four key components: (1) an Objectness Score-based Sample Reweighting
(OSSR) module that computes attention-based objectness scores on multi-scale
encoder feature maps, reweighting the detection loss to emphasize
less-recognized regions; (2) a Contrastive Learning with Matching-based Memory
Bank (CMMB) module that integrates multi-level features into memory banks,
enhancing class-wise contrastive learning; (3) an Uncertainty-weighted
Query-fused Feature Distillation (UQFD) module that improves feature
distillation through prediction quality reweighting and query feature fusion;
and (4) an improved self-training pipeline with a Dynamic Teacher Updating
Interval (DTUI) that optimizes pseudo-label quality. By leveraging these
components, FRANCK effectively adapts a source-pre-trained DETR model to a
target domain with enhanced robustness and generalization. Extensive
experiments on several widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its effectiveness and
compatibility with DETR-based SFOD models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: imHead is a novel implicit 3D morphable model that uses deep implicit functions to create expressive 3D head avatars with localized editing capabilities, outperforming previous methods while using a more compact latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3DMMs struggle with complex full-head shapes due to their strict topology and linear nature. Previous methods for localized editing required expensive latent sizes by dividing latent space into local components.

Method: Proposed imHead uses deep implicit functions with a single compact identity space and introduces intermediate region-specific latent representation to enable local edits. Trained on a large-scale dataset of 4K distinct identities.

Result: The model demonstrates expressive power to represent diverse identities and expressions, outperforming previous approaches. Provides interpretable solution for 3D face manipulation with localized editing capabilities.

Conclusion: imHead successfully addresses limitations of traditional 3DMMs by combining compact identity representation with localized editing through region-specific latent representations, enabling more efficient and expressive 3D head modeling.

Abstract: Over the last years, 3D morphable models (3DMMs) have emerged as a
state-of-the-art methodology for modeling and generating expressive 3D avatars.
However, given their reliance on a strict topology, along with their linear
nature, they struggle to represent complex full-head shapes. Following the
advent of deep implicit functions, we propose imHead, a novel implicit 3DMM
that not only models expressive 3D head avatars but also facilitates localized
editing of the facial features. Previous methods directly divided the latent
space into local components accompanied by an identity encoding to capture the
global shape variations, leading to expensive latent sizes. In contrast, we
retain a single compact identity space and introduce an intermediate
region-specific latent representation to enable local edits. To train imHead,
we curate a large-scale dataset of 4K distinct identities, making a
step-towards large scale 3D head modeling. Under a series of experiments we
demonstrate the expressive power of the proposed model to represent diverse
identities and expressions outperforming previous approaches. Additionally, the
proposed approach provides an interpretable solution for 3D face manipulation,
allowing the user to make localized edits.

*Xianlin Liu,Yan Gong,Bohao Li,Jiajing Huang,Bowen Du,Junchen Ye,Liyan Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a panoptic symbol spotting framework for CAD drawings that incorporates textual annotations and models relationships between geometric and textual primitives using a Transformer-based backbone with type-aware attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CAD drawing analysis methods overlook textual annotations and lack explicit modeling of relationships among primitives, leading to incomprehensive understanding of holistic drawings.

Method: Constructs unified representations by jointly modeling geometric and textual primitives, uses pretrained CNN for initial visual features, and employs Transformer-based backbone with type-aware attention to model different spatial dependencies.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches on symbol spotting tasks involving textual annotations and exhibits superior robustness on complex CAD drawings.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by incorporating textual information and explicit relationship modeling, achieving better performance in panoptic symbol spotting for CAD drawings.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Computer-Aided Design(CAD) drawings in
engineering, architecture, and industrial design, the ability to accurately
interpret and analyze these drawings has become increasingly critical. Among
various subtasks, panoptic symbol spotting plays a vital role in enabling
downstream applications such as CAD automation and design retrieval. Existing
methods primarily focus on geometric primitives within the CAD drawings to
address this task, but they face following major problems: they usually
overlook the rich textual annotations present in CAD drawings and they lack
explicit modeling of relationships among primitives, resulting in
incomprehensive understanding of the holistic drawings. To fill this gap, we
propose a panoptic symbol spotting framework that incorporates textual
annotations. The framework constructs unified representations by jointly
modeling geometric and textual primitives. Then, using visual features extract
by pretrained CNN as the initial representations, a Transformer-based backbone
is employed, enhanced with a type-aware attention mechanism to explicitly model
the different types of spatial dependencies between various primitives.
Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms existing approaches on symbol spotting tasks involving
textual annotations, and exhibits superior robustness when applied to complex
CAD drawings.

*Aleksandra Melnikova,Petr Matula*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents the first publicly available 3D time-lapse segmentation annotations for migrating cells with complex dynamic shapes, providing comprehensive dataset description and validation experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality segmentation annotations are critical for image processing advancement, but volumetric image annotations are time-consuming and challenging to create.

Method: Three distinct humans annotated two sequences of MDA231 human breast carcinoma cells from the Cell Tracking Challenge, creating full 3D time-lapse segmentation annotations.

Result: The annotations are consistent with CTC tracking markers and segmentation accuracy falls within inter-annotator variability margins. The 3D annotations better represent input image complexity compared to automatically created silver truth.

Conclusion: The presented annotations can be used for testing and training cell segmentation, or analyzing 3D shapes of highly dynamic objects.

Abstract: High-quality, publicly available segmentation annotations of image and video
datasets are critical for advancing the field of image processing. In
particular, annotations of volumetric images of a large number of targets are
time-consuming and challenging. In (Melnikova, A., & Matula, P., 2025), we
presented the first publicly available full 3D time-lapse segmentation
annotations of migrating cells with complex dynamic shapes. Concretely, three
distinct humans annotated two sequences of MDA231 human breast carcinoma cells
(Fluo-C3DL-MDA231) from the Cell Tracking Challenge (CTC).
  This paper aims to provide a comprehensive description of the dataset and
accompanying experiments that were not included in (Melnikova, A., & Matula,
P., 2025) due to limitations in publication space. Namely, we show that the
created annotations are consistent with the previously published tracking
markers provided by the CTC organizers and the segmentation accuracy measured
based on the 2D gold truth of CTC is within the inter-annotator variability
margins. We compared the created 3D annotations with automatically created
silver truth provided by CTC. We have found the proposed annotations better
represent the complexity of the input images. The presented annotations can be
used for testing and training cell segmentation, or analyzing 3D shapes of
highly dynamic objects.

*Guangzhi Sun,Yixuan Li,Xiaodong Wu,Yudong Yang,Wei Li,Zejun Ma,Chao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: video-SALMONN S is a streaming audio-visual LLM that processes 3-hour videos at 1 FPS and 360p resolution with fixed memory budget, using test-time-training memory module and selective memory retrieval to handle long-range dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video-understanding LLMs struggle with scaling to process continuous, high-frame-rate, high-resolution long video streams due to memory constraints and information loss from token merging/discarding.

Method: Introduces (i) test-time-training (TTT) memory module that continually updates token representations using Hessian-free conjugate-gradient optimization, replacing token merging, and (ii) prompt-dependent memory reader that selectively retrieves context-relevant content from fixed-size memory.

Result: Achieves 74.2% overall and 67.8% on Video-MME long split, outperforming both offline and streaming baselines. Sustains high-quality understanding on multi-hour videos with 10k frames and 1M tokens.

Conclusion: video-SALMONN S successfully enables continuous processing of long video streams under fixed memory constraints while maintaining high-quality understanding, representing a significant advancement in streaming video understanding capabilities.

Abstract: Continuous, high-frame-rate, high-resolution processing of long video streams
is critical for future AI agents, yet current video-understanding LLMs struggle
to scale. Offline, fixed-frame-number methods require the stream length to
adapt frame rates; streaming methods constrain memory by merging or discarding
tokens, losing information. We propose video-SALMONN S, a streaming
audio-visual LLM that, to our knowledge, is the first to process 3-hour videos
at 1 FPS and 360p resolution under a fixed memory budget. Our model introduces
(i) a test-time-training (TTT) memory module that continually updates token
representations to capture long-range dependencies by replacing token merging,
and (ii) a prompt-dependent memory reader that selectively retrieves
context-relevant content from fixed-size memory. The TTT module is optimised
with a Hessian-free conjugate-gradient procedure (TTT_HF) for efficient
adaptation. On long-video benchmarks (Video-MME, LVBench, VideoEvalPro),
video-SALMONN S sustains high-quality understanding on multi-hour videos with
10k frames and 1M tokens. Our 8B-parameter model achieves 74.2% overall and
67.8% on the Video-MME long split, outperforming both offline and streaming
baselines.

*Yesung Cho,Sungmin Lee,Geongyu Lee,Minkyung Lee,Jongbae Park,Dongmyung Shin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The G2L framework uses knowledge distillation to boost large-scale pathology models (15% of giga-scale parameters) to match giga-scale performance in cancer-specific tasks using only 1K target cancer slides.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Giga-scale pathology foundation models face prohibitive computational costs for practical use, creating need for more efficient alternatives that maintain high performance.

Method: Knowledge distillation transfers capabilities from giga-scale teacher model to large-scale student model using only 1,000 pathology slides of target cancer types.

Result: Distilled models outperformed same-size state-of-the-art models, sometimes surpassed giga-scale teacher and huge-scale models, and showed higher robustness to multi-institutional image variations.

Conclusion: The distillation approach provides data- and parameter-efficient way to achieve giga-scale performance for cancer-specific applications without excessive computational burden.

Abstract: Recent studies in pathology foundation models have shown that scaling
training data, diversifying cancer types, and increasing model size
consistently improve their performance. However, giga-scale foundation models,
which are trained on hundreds of thousands of slides covering tens of cancer
types and contain billions of parameters, pose significant challenges for
practical use due to their tremendous computational costs in both development
and deployment. In this work, we present a novel strategy, named the G2L
framework, to increase the performance of large-scale foundation models, which
consist of only $15\%$ of the parameters of giga-scale models, to a comparable
performance level of giga-scale models in cancer-specific tasks. Our approach
applies knowledge distillation, transferring the capabilities of a giga-scale
model to a large-scale model, using just 1K pathology slides of a target cancer
(e.g., breast, prostate, etc.). The resulting distilled model not only
outperformed state-of-the-art models of the same size (i.e., large-scale)
across several benchmarks but also, interestingly, surpassed the giga-scale
teacher and huge-scale models in some benchmarks. In addition, the distilled
model exhibited a higher robustness index, indicating improved resilience to
image variations originating from multiple institutions. These findings suggest
that the proposed distillation approach for a large-scale model is a data- and
parameter-efficient way to achieve giga-scale-level performance for
cancer-specific applications without prohibitive computational burden.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes two merging strategies (ECLM and Mask-ToMe) and a diffusion-based decoder to accelerate 3D Human Mesh Recovery transformers while maintaining or slightly improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transformer-based 3D Human Mesh Recovery models suffer from high computational cost and complexity due to deep architectures and redundant tokens.

Method: Two HMR-specific merging strategies: Error-Constrained Layer Merging (ECLM) for selective layer merging based on MPJPE impact, and Mask-guided Token Merging (Mask-ToMe) for merging background tokens. Also includes a diffusion-based decoder with temporal context and pose priors.

Result: Achieves up to 2.3x speed-up while slightly improving performance over baseline across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively reduces computational cost while maintaining or enhancing performance in 3D Human Mesh Recovery.

Abstract: Recent transformer-based models for 3D Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) have
achieved strong performance but often suffer from high computational cost and
complexity due to deep transformer architectures and redundant tokens. In this
paper, we introduce two HMR-specific merging strategies: Error-Constrained
Layer Merging (ECLM) and Mask-guided Token Merging (Mask-ToMe). ECLM
selectively merges transformer layers that have minimal impact on the Mean Per
Joint Position Error (MPJPE), while Mask-ToMe focuses on merging background
tokens that contribute little to the final prediction. To further address the
potential performance drop caused by merging, we propose a diffusion-based
decoder that incorporates temporal context and leverages pose priors learned
from large-scale motion capture datasets. Experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves up to 2.3x speed-up while
slightly improving performance over the baseline.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LightPneumoNet is a lightweight CNN for pneumonia detection from chest X-rays that achieves high accuracy (94.2%) with minimal computational requirements (1.48MB memory footprint), making it suitable for resource-limited settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of deploying large deep learning models in resource-limited settings for pneumonia diagnosis, where existing approaches require heavy architectures or fail to achieve high sensitivity.

Method: Custom lightweight CNN architecture with four blocks of stacked convolutional layers, trained on 5,856 chest X-ray images with preprocessing (resizing to 224x224, grayscale conversion, normalization) and data augmentation (rotation, zoom, shear). Contains only 388,082 trainable parameters.

Result: Achieved 94.2% accuracy, 92% precision, 96% F1-Score, and critically 99% sensitivity (recall) on independent test set, demonstrating near-perfect ability to identify true pneumonia cases while minimizing false negatives.

Conclusion: LightPneumoNet provides an efficient, accessible diagnostic solution that can be deployed on low-cost hardware, serving as a reliable second-opinion tool to improve patient outcomes in underserved clinics.

Abstract: Effective pneumonia diagnosis is often challenged by the difficulty of
deploying large, computationally expensive deep learning models in
resource-limited settings. This study introduces LightPneumoNet, an efficient,
lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) built from scratch to provide an
accessible and accurate diagnostic solution for pneumonia detection from chest
X-rays. Our model was trained on a public dataset of 5,856 chest X-ray images.
Preprocessing included image resizing to 224x224, grayscale conversion, and
pixel normalization, with data augmentation (rotation, zoom, shear) to prevent
overfitting. The custom architecture features four blocks of stacked
convolutional layers and contains only 388,082 trainable parameters, resulting
in a minimal 1.48 MB memory footprint. On the independent test set, our model
delivered exceptional performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 0.942,
precision of 0.92, and an F1-Score of 0.96. Critically, it obtained a
sensitivity (recall) of 0.99, demonstrating a near-perfect ability to identify
true pneumonia cases and minimize clinically significant false negatives.
Notably, LightPneumoNet achieves this high recall on the same dataset where
existing approaches typically require significantly heavier architectures or
fail to reach comparable sensitivity levels. The model's efficiency enables
deployment on low-cost hardware, making advanced computer-aided diagnosis
accessible in underserved clinics and serving as a reliable second-opinion tool
to improve patient outcomes.

*Shutong Lin,Zhengkang Xiang,Jianzhong Qi,Kourosh Khoshelham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RareBoost3D is a synthetic point cloud dataset that addresses the long-tail problem in LiDAR perception by providing more instances for rare object classes, complemented by a cross-domain semantic alignment method (CSC loss) to improve segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world point cloud datasets suffer from long-tail distribution where rare classes have limited instances, hindering the development of robust LiDAR-based perception systems for autonomous driving.

Method: Created RareBoost3D synthetic dataset with more instances for rare classes, and proposed CSC loss for cross-domain semantic alignment to align feature representations of same classes across synthetic and real-world domains.

Result: Experimental results show that the cross-domain alignment significantly enhances LiDAR point cloud segmentation performance over real-world data.

Conclusion: The combination of synthetic RareBoost3D dataset and CSC loss alignment method effectively addresses the long-tail problem and improves segmentation performance for rare object classes in LiDAR perception.

Abstract: Real-world point cloud datasets have made significant contributions to the
development of LiDAR-based perception technologies, such as object segmentation
for autonomous driving. However, due to the limited number of instances in some
rare classes, the long-tail problem remains a major challenge in existing
datasets. To address this issue, we introduce a novel, synthetic point cloud
dataset named RareBoost3D, which complements existing real-world datasets by
providing significantly more instances for object classes that are rare in
real-world datasets. To effectively leverage both synthetic and real-world
data, we further propose a cross-domain semantic alignment method named CSC
loss that aligns feature representations of the same class across different
domains. Experimental results demonstrate that this alignment significantly
enhances the performance of LiDAR point cloud segmentation models over
real-world data.

Motivation: Digital linguistic dataset resources for underrepresented sign languages like Nepali Sign Language (NSL) remain scarce, creating a need for systematic research in low-resource settings.

Method: Created the first NSL benchmark dataset with 36 gesture classes and 1,500 samples per class, then fine-tuned MobileNetV2 and ResNet50 architectures on this dataset for sign recognition.

Result: MobileNetV2 achieved 90.45% classification accuracy and ResNet50 achieved 88.78% accuracy, demonstrating effective sign recognition performance.

Abstract: Sign languages serve as essential communication systems for individuals with
hearing and speech impairments. However, digital linguistic dataset resources
for underrepresented sign languages, such as Nepali Sign Language (NSL), remain
scarce. This study introduces the first benchmark dataset for NSL, consisting
of 36 gesture classes with 1,500 samples per class, designed to capture the
structural and visual features of the language. To evaluate recognition
performance, we fine-tuned MobileNetV2 and ResNet50 architectures on the

TL;DR: EarthWhere is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLM image geolocation capabilities, testing visual recognition, reasoning, and evidence use across 810 global images at country and street levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs lack comprehensive evaluation for image-grounded geolocation in open-world conditions, which is challenging and in high demand for real-life applications.

Method: Created EarthWhere benchmark with 810 globally distributed images across two scales: WhereCountry (500 country-level MCQs with panoramas) and WhereStreet (310 street-level tasks requiring multi-step reasoning with optional web search). Uses location accuracy metrics and proposes Shapley-reweighted thinking score for intermediate reasoning.

Result: Benchmarked 13 state-of-the-art VLMs: Gemini-2.5-Pro achieved best accuracy at 56.32%, GLM-4.5V (strongest open-weight) reached 34.71%. Found web search and reasoning don't guarantee improved performance with limited visual clues, and models show regional biases (up to 42.7% higher scores in certain areas).

Conclusion: EarthWhere reveals both promise and persistent challenges in VLM geolocation - highlighting needs to mitigate bias and achieve robust fine-grained localization. The benchmark is open-sourced for community use.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced rapidly, yet their capacity for
image-grounded geolocation in open-world conditions, a task that is challenging
and of demand in real life, has not been comprehensively evaluated. We present
EarthWhere, a comprehensive benchmark for VLM image geolocation that evaluates
visual recognition, step-by-step reasoning, and evidence use. EarthWhere
comprises 810 globally distributed images across two complementary geolocation
scales: WhereCountry (i.e., 500 multiple-choice question-answering, with
country-level answer and panoramas) and WhereStreet (i.e., 310 fine-grained
street-level identification tasks requiring multi-step reasoning with optional
web search). For evaluation, we adopt the final-prediction metrics: location
accuracies within k km (Acc@k) for coordinates and hierarchical path scores for
textual localization. Beyond this, we propose to explicitly score intermediate
reasoning chains using human-verified key visual clues and a Shapley-reweighted
thinking score that attributes credit to each clue's marginal contribution. We
benchmark 13 state-of-the-art VLMs with web searching tools on our EarthWhere
and report different types of final answer accuracies as well as the calibrated
model thinking scores. Overall, Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the best average
accuracy at 56.32%, while the strongest open-weight model, GLM-4.5V, reaches
34.71%. We reveal that web search and reasoning do not guarantee improved
performance when visual clues are limited, and models exhibit regional biases,
achieving up to 42.7% higher scores in certain areas than others. These
findings highlight not only the promise but also the persistent challenges of
models to mitigate bias and achieve robust, fine-grained localization. We
open-source our benchmark at https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/EarthWhere.

*Yuxuan Chen,Ruotong Yang,Zhengyang Zhang,Mehreen Ahmed,Yanming Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Automated multi-modal framework for SEM scale bar detection using object detection, hybrid OCR, and LLM agent to eliminate manual operations and improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual scale bar detection in SEM images is time-consuming and error-prone, creating a need for automated solutions to improve efficiency and accuracy in microscopic analysis.

Method: Four-phase framework: 1) Auto-DG for synthetic dataset generation, 2) object detection for scale bar localization, 3) hybrid OCR with DenseNet and CRNN for text extraction, 4) LLM agent for result verification and analysis.

Result: Object detection achieved 100% precision, 95.8% recall, 99.2% mAP@0.5; OCR achieved 89% precision, 65% recall, 75% F1 score; outperformed standalone OCR engines.

Conclusion: The automated LLM-powered framework significantly enhances SEM scale bar detection efficiency and accuracy, providing a valuable tool for scientific imaging advancement.

Abstract: Microscopic characterizations, such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM),
are widely used in scientific research for visualizing and analyzing
microstructures. Determining the scale bars is an important first step of
accurate SEM analysis; however, currently, it mainly relies on manual
operations, which is both time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this
issue, we propose a multi-modal and automated scale bar detection and
extraction framework that provides concurrent object detection, text detection
and text recognition with a Large Language Model (LLM) agent. The proposed
framework operates in four phases; i) Automatic Dataset Generation (Auto-DG)
model to synthesize a diverse dataset of SEM images ensuring robust training
and high generalizability of the model, ii) scale bar object detection, iii)
information extraction using a hybrid Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
system with DenseNet and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) based
algorithms, iv) an LLM agent to analyze and verify accuracy of the results. The
proposed model demonstrates a strong performance in object detection and
accurate localization with a precision of 100%, recall of 95.8%, and a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 99.2% at IoU=0.5 and 69.1% at IoU=0.5:0.95. The
hybrid OCR system achieved 89% precision, 65% recall, and a 75% F1 score on the
Auto-DG dataset, significantly outperforming several mainstream standalone
engines, highlighting its reliability for scientific image analysis. The LLM is
introduced as a reasoning engine as well as an intelligent assistant that
suggests follow-up steps and verifies the results. This automated method
powered by an LLM agent significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of
scale bar detection and extraction in SEM images, providing a valuable tool for
microscopic analysis and advancing the field of scientific imaging.

### [143] [When Does Supervised Training Pay Off? The Hidden Economics of Object Detection in the Era of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11302)
*Samer Al-Hamadani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper compares supervised object detection (YOLO) vs zero-shot VLM inference (Gemini Flash 2.5), finding YOLO has 91.2% accuracy vs 68.5% for Gemini but requires $10,800 annotation costs. Zero-shot Gemini works on diverse categories where YOLO fails, with break-even at 55M inferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional supervised detection requires expensive manual annotations, while zero-shot VLMs eliminate annotation costs but have lower accuracy. Need comprehensive cost-effectiveness analysis to guide architecture selection.

Method: Systematic evaluation on 1,000 COCO images and 200 diverse product images, combined with Total Cost of Ownership modeling to establish quantitative break-even thresholds.

Result: YOLO: 91.2% accuracy on standard categories, costs $10,800 annotation. Gemini: 68.5% accuracy on standard categories, 52.3% on diverse products (vs 0% for YOLO). Break-even at 55M inferences. Gemini cost per detection: $0.00050 vs $0.143 for YOLO at 100k inferences.

Conclusion: Optimal architecture selection depends on deployment volume, category stability, budget constraints, and accuracy requirements rather than purely technical performance metrics.

Abstract: Object detection systems have traditionally relied on supervised learning
with manually annotated bounding boxes, achieving high accuracy at the cost of
substantial annotation investment. The emergence of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) offers an alternative paradigm enabling zero-shot detection through
natural language queries, eliminating annotation requirements but operating
with reduced accuracy. This paper presents the first comprehensive
cost-effectiveness analysis comparing supervised detection (YOLO) with
zero-shot VLM inference (Gemini Flash 2.5). Through systematic evaluation on
1,000 stratified COCO images and 200 diverse product images spanning consumer
electronics and rare categories, combined with detailed Total Cost of Ownership
modeling, we establish quantitative break-even thresholds governing
architecture selection. Our findings reveal that supervised YOLO achieves 91.2%
accuracy versus 68.5% for zero-shot Gemini on standard categories, representing
a 22.7 percentage point advantage that costs $10,800 in annotation for
100-category systems. However, this advantage justifies investment only beyond
55 million inferences, equivalent to 151,000 images daily for one year.
Zero-shot Gemini demonstrates 52.3% accuracy on diverse product categories
(ranging from highly web-prevalent consumer electronics at 75-85% to rare
specialized equipment at 25-40%) where supervised YOLO achieves 0% due to
architectural constraints preventing detection of untrained classes. Cost per
Correct Detection analysis reveals substantially lower per-detection costs for
Gemini ($0.00050 vs $0.143) at 100,000 inferences despite accuracy deficits. We
develop decision frameworks demonstrating that optimal architecture selection
depends critically on deployment volume, category stability, budget
constraints, and accuracy requirements rather than purely technical performance
metrics.

*Honghui Yuan,Keiji Yanai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneTextStylizer is a training-free diffusion-based framework for flexible and high-fidelity style transfer of text in scene images, enabling prompt-guided style transformation while preserving text readability and stylistic consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scene text editing methods are limited to content replacement and simple styles, lacking the ability for free-style transfer. There's a need for flexible and localized style editing for scene text.

Method: The framework uses a feature injection module with diffusion model inversion and self-attention, a region control mechanism with distance-based changing masks, and a style enhancement module based on Fourier transform.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior performance in scene text style transformation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both visual fidelity and text preservation.

Conclusion: SceneTextStylizer successfully addresses the challenge of flexible and localized style editing for scene text, achieving high-quality style transfer while maintaining text readability.

Abstract: With the rapid development of diffusion models, style transfer has made
remarkable progress. However, flexible and localized style editing for scene
text remains an unsolved challenge. Although existing scene text editing
methods have achieved text region editing, they are typically limited to
content replacement and simple styles, which lack the ability of free-style
transfer. In this paper, we introduce SceneTextStylizer, a novel training-free
diffusion-based framework for flexible and high-fidelity style transfer of text
in scene images. Unlike prior approaches that either perform global style
transfer or focus solely on textual content modification, our method enables
prompt-guided style transformation specifically for text regions, while
preserving both text readability and stylistic consistency. To achieve this, we
design a feature injection module that leverages diffusion model inversion and
self-attention to transfer style features effectively. Additionally, a region
control mechanism is introduced by applying a distance-based changing mask at
each denoising step, enabling precise spatial control. To further enhance
visual quality, we incorporate a style enhancement module based on the Fourier
transform to reinforce stylistic richness. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves superior performance in scene text style
transformation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual
fidelity and text preservation.

*Joshua Niemeijer,Jan Ehrhardt,Heinz Handels,Hristina Uzunova*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an uncertainty-guided ControlNet that uses unlabeled domain data to create synthetic annotated datasets, improving segmentation performance on domain-shifted data without additional supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ControlNets reproduce original training distributions, limiting their effectiveness for domain adaptation. The need arises to leverage unlabeled domain data to create synthetic datasets that can improve segmentation models for domain-shifted data like Home-OCT retinal images.

Method: Proposes uncertainty-guided ControlNet that incorporates uncertainty control from unlabeled datasets alongside semantic control from labeled datasets. The uncertainty indicates when images are outside the training distribution, enabling creation of annotated data from target domains.

Result: The approach successfully synthesizes annotated Home-OCT retinal images, leading to significantly improved segmentation results without additional supervision. Also demonstrated effectiveness in traffic scene experiments, outperforming style transfer methods.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-guidance enables effective domain adaptation by creating synthetic annotated data from unlabeled domains, overcoming limitations of traditional ControlNets and style transfer methods while requiring no additional supervision.

Abstract: Generative Models are a valuable tool for the controlled creation of
high-quality image data. Controlled diffusion models like the ControlNet have
allowed the creation of labeled distributions. Such synthetic datasets can
augment the original training distribution when discriminative models, like
semantic segmentation, are trained. However, this augmentation effect is
limited since ControlNets tend to reproduce the original training distribution.
  This work introduces a method to utilize data from unlabeled domains to train
ControlNets by introducing the concept of uncertainty into the control
mechanism. The uncertainty indicates that a given image was not part of the
training distribution of a downstream task, e.g., segmentation. Thus, two types
of control are engaged in the final network: an uncertainty control from an
unlabeled dataset and a semantic control from the labeled dataset. The
resulting ControlNet allows us to create annotated data with high uncertainty
from the target domain, i.e., synthetic data from the unlabeled distribution
with labels. In our scenario, we consider retinal OCTs, where typically
high-quality Spectralis images are available with given ground truth
segmentations, enabling the training of segmentation networks. The recent
development in Home-OCT devices, however, yields retinal OCTs with lower
quality and a large domain shift, such that out-of-the-pocket segmentation
networks cannot be applied for this type of data. Synthesizing annotated images
from the Home-OCT domain using the proposed approach closes this gap and leads
to significantly improved segmentation results without adding any further
supervision. The advantage of uncertainty-guidance becomes obvious when
compared to style transfer: it enables arbitrary domain shifts without any
strict learning of an image style. This is also demonstrated in a traffic scene
experiment.

Motivation: Current agentic workflows for document generation focus primarily on textual quality while neglecting visual structure and style, which are crucial for readability and engagement. There is a gap in suitable reward models to guide workflows toward producing documents with stronger structural and stylistic quality.

Method: The authors propose DocReward, a document reward model trained using Bradley-Terry loss on a multi-domain dataset called DocPair containing 117K paired documents across 32 domains and 267 document types. Each pair includes high- and low-professionalism documents with identical content but different structure and style.

Result: DocReward outperforms GPT-4o and GPT-5 in accuracy by 30.6 and 19.4 percentage points respectively. In document generation tasks, DocReward achieves a 60.8% win rate compared to GPT-5's 37.7% win rate, demonstrating its effectiveness in guiding generation agents to produce human-preferred documents.

Conclusion: DocReward effectively addresses the gap in evaluating document structure and style, providing a superior reward model that can guide agentic workflows to generate more professional and human-preferred documents.

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic workflows have enabled the automation of tasks
such as professional document generation. However, they primarily focus on
textual quality, neglecting visual structure and style, which are crucial for
readability and engagement. This gap arises mainly from the absence of suitable
reward models to guide agentic workflows toward producing documents with
stronger structural and stylistic quality. To address this, we propose
DocReward, a document reward model that evaluates documents based on their
structure and style. We construct a multi-domain dataset DocPair of 117K paired
documents, covering 32 domains and 267 document types, each including a high-
and low-professionalism document with identical content but different structure
and style. This enables the model to evaluate professionalism comprehensively,
and in a textual-quality-agnostic way. DocReward is trained using the
Bradley-Terry loss to score documents, penalizing predictions that contradict
the annotated ranking. To assess the performance of reward models, we create a
test dataset containing document bundles ranked by well-educated human
evaluators. Notably, DocReward outperforms GPT-4o and GPT-5 in accuracy by 30.6
and 19.4 percentage points, respectively, demonstrating its superiority over
baselines. In an extrinsic evaluation of document generation, DocReward
achieves a significantly higher win rate of 60.8%, compared to GPT-5's 37.7%
win rate, demonstrating its utility in guiding generation agents toward
producing human-preferred documents.

### [148] [Towards Distribution-Shift Uncertainty Estimation for Inverse Problems with Generative Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10947)
*Namhoon Kim,Sara Fridovich-Keil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a calibration-free uncertainty indicator for detecting distribution shift in generative model-based medical image reconstruction, using reconstruction stability under random measurement variations as a proxy for out-of-distribution detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models improve reconstruction quality with fewer measurements but risk hallucinating features when test images are out-of-distribution. Existing uncertainty methods require calibration datasets, provide heuristic estimates, or don't specifically address distribution shift.

Method: Uses reconstruction stability under random measurement variations as an OOD indicator - in-distribution images remain stable while OOD images show greater instability. No knowledge of training distribution or retraining required.

Result: Validated on MNIST tomographic reconstruction, where a network trained only on digit "0" showed higher reconstruction variability and error for OOD digits (1-9), confirming the indicator's effectiveness.

Conclusion: Enables deployment strategy pairing generative priors with lightweight guardrails, allowing aggressive measurement reduction for in-distribution cases while automatically warning when applied out-of-distribution.

Abstract: Generative models have shown strong potential as data-driven priors for
solving inverse problems such as reconstructing medical images from
undersampled measurements. While these priors improve reconstruction quality
with fewer measurements, they risk hallucinating features when test images lie
outside the training distribution. Existing uncertainty quantification methods
in this setting (i) require an in-distribution calibration dataset, which may
not be available, (ii) provide heuristic rather than statistical estimates, or
(iii) quantify uncertainty from model capacity or limited measurements rather
than distribution shift. We propose an instance-level, calibration-free
uncertainty indicator that is sensitive to distribution shift, requires no
knowledge of the training distribution, and incurs no retraining cost. Our key
hypothesis is that reconstructions of in-distribution images remain stable
under random measurement variations, while reconstructions of
out-of-distribution (OOD) images exhibit greater instability. We use this
stability as a proxy for detecting distribution shift. Our proposed OOD
indicator is efficiently computable for any computational imaging inverse
problem; we demonstrate it on tomographic reconstruction of MNIST digits, where
a learned proximal network trained only on digit "0" is evaluated on all ten
digits. Reconstructions of OOD digits show higher variability and
correspondingly higher reconstruction error, validating this indicator. These
results suggest a deployment strategy that pairs generative priors with
lightweight guardrails, enabling aggressive measurement reduction for
in-distribution cases while automatically warning when priors are applied out
of distribution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately evaluating intuitive physics understanding in video diffusion models is challenging due to difficulty in disentangling physics correctness from visual appearance in generation.

Method: Uses denoising objective as ELBO-based likelihood surrogate on curated dataset of valid-invalid video pairs, with Plausibility Preference Error (PPE) metric tested on 12 scenarios across 4 physics domains.

Result: PPE demonstrates strong alignment with human preference, outperforming state-of-the-art evaluator baselines. Current models struggle with complex dynamics but show improvement trend with scaling model capacity and inference settings.

Conclusion: LikePhys provides effective evaluation of intuitive physics in video diffusion models, revealing domain-specific capacity variations and scaling trends in physics understanding.

Abstract: Intuitive physics understanding in video diffusion models plays an essential
role in building general-purpose physically plausible world simulators, yet
accurately evaluating such capacity remains a challenging task due to the
difficulty in disentangling physics correctness from visual appearance in
generation. To the end, we introduce LikePhys, a training-free method that
evaluates intuitive physics in video diffusion models by distinguishing
physically valid and impossible videos using the denoising objective as an
ELBO-based likelihood surrogate on a curated dataset of valid-invalid pairs. By
testing on our constructed benchmark of twelve scenarios spanning over four
physics domains, we show that our evaluation metric, Plausibility Preference
Error (PPE), demonstrates strong alignment with human preference, outperforming
state-of-the-art evaluator baselines. We then systematically benchmark
intuitive physics understanding in current video diffusion models. Our study
further analyses how model design and inference settings affect intuitive
physics understanding and highlights domain-specific capacity variations across
physical laws. Empirical results show that, despite current models struggling
with complex and chaotic dynamics, there is a clear trend of improvement in
physics understanding as model capacity and inference settings scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs like GPT-4 and DALL-E struggle with preserving logic, object identity, and style in multimodal generation, limiting their generalization in complex image-text scenarios.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) dynamic IUT-Plug extraction module that parses visual scenes into hierarchical symbolic structures, and (2) coordinated narrative-flow and image synthesis mechanism for cross-modal consistency.

Result: IUT-Plug improves accuracy on established benchmarks and effectively alleviates three critical forms of context drift across diverse multimodal QA scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed IUT-Plug framework successfully mitigates context drift issues in VLMs through explicit structured reasoning, enhancing their performance in complex multimodal generation tasks.

Abstract: Existing vision language models (VLMs), including GPT-4 and DALL-E, often
struggle to preserve logic, object identity, and style in multimodal image-text
generation. This limitation significantly hinders the generalization capability
of VLMs in complex image-text input-output scenarios. To address this issue, we
propose IUT-Plug, a module grounded in an Image Understanding Tree (IUT), which
enhances existing interleaved VLMs through explicit structured reasoning,
thereby mitigating context drift in logic, entity identity, and style. The
proposed framework operates in two stages. (1) A dynamic IUT-Plug extraction
module parses visual scenes into hierarchical symbolic structures. (2) A
coordinated narrative-flow and image synthesis mechanism ensures cross-modal
consistency. To evaluate our approach, we construct a novel benchmark based on
3,000 real human-generated question-answer pairs over fine-tuned large models,
introducing a dynamic evaluation protocol for quantifying context drift in
interleaved VLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that IUT-Plug not only
improves accuracy on established benchmarks but also effectively alleviates the
three critical forms of context drift across diverse multimodal question
answering (QA) scenarios.

Result: EvoCAD outperforms previous approaches on multiple metrics, particularly excelling in generating topologically correct objects as measured by the novel topological metrics.

Conclusion: The combination of LLMs with evolutionary computation shows promise for CAD generation, with EvoCAD demonstrating superior performance in topological correctness through novel evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Combining large language models with evolutionary computation algorithms

comparing it to prior methods. Additionally, we introduce two new metrics based
on topological properties defined by the Euler characteristic, which capture a
form of semantic similarity between 3D objects. Our results demonstrate that
EvoCAD outperforms previous approaches on multiple metrics, particularly in
generating topologically correct objects, which can be efficiently evaluated
using our two novel metrics that complement existing spatial metrics.

TL;DR: Chart-RVR is a framework that fine-tunes LVLMs for robust and explainable chart reasoning using Group Relative Policy Optimization with verifiable rewards, achieving SOTA performance on chart reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs struggle with out-of-distribution data and produce unreliable chain-of-thought rationales, limiting their explainability and robustness in chart reasoning tasks.

Method: Fine-tunes LVLMs using Group Relative Policy Optimization with three verifiable rewards: chart-type classification accuracy, faithful chart table reconstruction, and process conformity.

Result: Chart-RVR-3B models achieve state-of-the-art results on six chart-reasoning benchmarks, closing the OOD performance gap while improving rationale fidelity and interpretability.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the power of verifiable rewards with GRPO for training reliable, interpretable chart-reasoning models that strengthen trust and reliability.

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have reached
state-of-the-art on many visual reasoning tasks, including chart reasoning, yet
they still falter on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and degrade further when
asked to produce their chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales, limiting
explainability. We present Chart-RVR, a general framework that fine-tunes LVLMs
to be more robust and explainable for chart reasoning by coupling Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with automatically verifiable rewards. Our
framework comprises of three rewards that maximize: (i) correct chart-type
classification, (ii) faithful chart table reconstruction, and (iii) process
conformity. Applied to 3-billion-parameter LVLMs, Chart-RVR consistently
outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution datasets, closing the OOD performance gap while improving
rationale fidelity. The resulting models, the Chart-RVR-3B series, achieve
state-of-the-art results on six chart-reasoning benchmarks spanning in-domain
and OOD settings, surpassing all existing models of comparable size. Beyond
accuracy, Chart-RVR yields more interpretable CoT rationales, strengthening
trust and reliability - showcasing the power of verifiable rewards with GRPO
for training reliable, interpretable chart-reasoning models.

*Krittin Chaowakarn,Paramin Sangwongngam,Nang Htet Htet Aung,Chalie Charoenlarpnopparut*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NV3D is a 3D object detection model that uses normal vectors computed from voxel neighbors via KNN and PCA to enhance feature representation, with sampling strategies that can eliminate up to 55% of data while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-modal methods face feature alignment challenges, and local feature extraction can be oversimplified for complex 3D object detection tasks. The paper aims to address these limitations by leveraging informative normal vector features.

Method: Proposes NV3D model that computes normal vectors per voxel using KNN and PCA, with two sampling strategies: normal vector density-based sampling and FOV-aware bin-based sampling. Uses element-wise attention fusion with voxel features as query/value and normal vector features as key.

Result: NV3D achieves 86.60% and 80.18% mAP for car and cyclist detection on KITTI dataset, outperforming baseline Voxel R-CNN by 2.61% and 4.23% respectively. With sampling, achieves 85.54% mAP for car detection while filtering out ~55% of voxels.

Conclusion: NV3D demonstrates superior performance in 3D object detection, particularly for cars and cyclists, by effectively leveraging normal vector features and efficient sampling strategies that maintain performance while significantly reducing computational requirements.

Abstract: Recent studies in 3D object detection for autonomous vehicles aim to enrich
features through the utilization of multi-modal setups or the extraction of
local patterns within LiDAR point clouds. However, multi-modal methods face
significant challenges in feature alignment, and gaining features locally can
be oversimplified for complex 3D object detection tasks. In this paper, we
propose a novel model, NV3D, which utilizes local features acquired from voxel
neighbors, as normal vectors computed per voxel basis using K-nearest neighbors
(KNN) and principal component analysis (PCA). This informative feature enables
NV3D to determine the relationship between the surface and pertinent target
entities, including cars, pedestrians, or cyclists. During the normal vector
extraction process, NV3D offers two distinct sampling strategies: normal vector
density-based sampling and FOV-aware bin-based sampling, allowing elimination
of up to 55% of data while maintaining performance. In addition, we applied
element-wise attention fusion, which accepts voxel features as the query and
value and normal vector features as the key, similar to the attention
mechanism. Our method is trained on the KITTI dataset and has demonstrated
superior performance in car and cyclist detection owing to their spatial
shapes. In the validation set, NV3D without sampling achieves 86.60% and 80.18%
mean Average Precision (mAP), greater than the baseline Voxel R-CNN by 2.61%
and 4.23% mAP, respectively. With both samplings, NV3D achieves 85.54% mAP in
car detection, exceeding the baseline by 1.56% mAP, despite roughly 55% of
voxels being filtered out.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Multimodal Mixup (MM) and Balanced Multimodal Mixup (B-MM) to address overfitting of strong modalities in multimodal video understanding by generating virtual feature-label pairs and dynamically adjusting mixing ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal models tend to overfit strong modalities, which dominate learning and suppress weaker modalities, limiting the effectiveness of multimodal video understanding for tasks like action recognition and emotion classification.

Method: First introduces Multimodal Mixup (MM) that applies Mixup strategy at aggregated multimodal feature level to generate virtual feature-label pairs. Then proposes Balanced Multimodal Mixup (B-MM) that dynamically adjusts mixing ratios for each modality based on their relative contributions to address modality imbalance.

Result: Extensive experiments on several datasets show the methods effectively improve generalization and multimodal robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed MM and B-MM approaches successfully mitigate overfitting of strong modalities and enhance multimodal learning performance in video understanding tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal video understanding plays a crucial role in tasks such as action
recognition and emotion classification by combining information from different
modalities. However, multimodal models are prone to overfitting strong
modalities, which can dominate learning and suppress the contributions of
weaker ones. To address this challenge, we first propose Multimodal Mixup (MM),
which applies the Mixup strategy at the aggregated multimodal feature level to
mitigate overfitting by generating virtual feature-label pairs. While MM
effectively improves generalization, it treats all modalities uniformly and
does not account for modality imbalance during training. Building on MM, we
further introduce Balanced Multimodal Mixup (B-MM), which dynamically adjusts
the mixing ratios for each modality based on their relative contributions to
the learning objective. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of our methods in improving generalization and multimodal
robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FACE is a framework that improves concept-based explanations of deep neural networks by using KL divergence regularization with NMF to ensure alignment between original and concept-based predictions, enhancing faithfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automatic concept discovery methods often fail to align extracted concepts with the model's actual decision-making process, compromising explanation faithfulness.

Method: Augments Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) with KL divergence regularization, incorporates classifier supervision during concept learning to enforce predictive consistency, and provides theoretical guarantees for faithful local linearity.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on faithfulness and sparsity metrics across ImageNet, COCO, and CelebA datasets.

Conclusion: FACE successfully bridges the gap between low-level features and human-understandable semantics while maintaining faithful alignment with the model's decision process.

Abstract: Interpreting deep neural networks through concept-based explanations offers a
bridge between low-level features and high-level human-understandable
semantics. However, existing automatic concept discovery methods often fail to
align these extracted concepts with the model's true decision-making process,
thereby compromising explanation faithfulness. In this work, we propose FACE
(Faithful Automatic Concept Extraction), a novel framework that augments
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) with a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
regularization term to ensure alignment between the model's original and
concept-based predictions. Unlike prior methods that operate solely on encoder
activations, FACE incorporates classifier supervision during concept learning,
enforcing predictive consistency and enabling faithful explanations. We provide
theoretical guarantees showing that minimizing the KL divergence bounds the
deviation in predictive distributions, thereby promoting faithful local
linearity in the learned concept space. Systematic evaluations on ImageNet,
COCO, and CelebA datasets demonstrate that FACE outperforms existing methods
across faithfulness and sparsity metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models struggle with multi-instance image generation due to limitations in precise layout control and maintaining identity consistency of multiple distinct subjects.

Method: ContextGen integrates two key components: Contextual Layout Anchoring (CLA) that incorporates composite layout images to anchor objects in desired positions, and Identity Consistency Attention (ICA) that uses reference images to ensure identity consistency across multiple instances. The framework is built on a Diffusion Transformer architecture.

Result: ContextGen achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in control precision, identity fidelity, and overall visual quality. The authors also introduce IMIG-100K, the first large-scale dataset with detailed layout and identity annotations for this task.

Conclusion: The proposed ContextGen framework effectively addresses the challenges of multi-instance image generation by combining layout guidance with identity preservation mechanisms, setting a new benchmark for the field.

Abstract: Multi-instance image generation (MIG) remains a significant challenge for
modern diffusion models due to key limitations in achieving precise control
over object layout and preserving the identity of multiple distinct subjects.
To address these limitations, we introduce ContextGen, a novel Diffusion
Transformer framework for multi-instance generation that is guided by both
layout and reference images. Our approach integrates two key technical
contributions: a Contextual Layout Anchoring (CLA) mechanism that incorporates
the composite layout image into the generation context to robustly anchor the
objects in their desired positions, and Identity Consistency Attention (ICA),
an innovative attention mechanism that leverages contextual reference images to
ensure the identity consistency of multiple instances. Recognizing the lack of
large-scale, hierarchically-structured datasets for this task, we introduce
IMIG-100K, the first dataset with detailed layout and identity annotations.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ContextGen sets a new state-of-the-art,
outperforming existing methods in control precision, identity fidelity, and
overall visual quality.

TL;DR: FASS framework improves medical image segmentation by enhancing foreground focus, using frequency analysis for boundary details, and maintaining geometric continuity, achieving superior performance in complex low-contrast scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models struggle with foreground focus in complex medical images where tumors resemble normal tissues, requiring better contextual differentiation for surgical planning and tumor staging.

Method: Three-module framework: foreground-aware module amplifies background distinction, wavelet-based frequency enhancement extracts high-frequency features for boundaries, and edge constraint module preserves geometric continuity.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior performance across all metrics, with strong robustness in complex conditions and excellent fine structure recognition, especially for low-contrast images.

Conclusion: FASS framework significantly enhances segmentation quality in challenging medical imaging scenarios and enables applications in more diverse and complex medical contexts.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tumors and adjacent normal tissues in medical images
is essential for surgical planning and tumor staging. Although foundation
models generally perform well in segmentation tasks, they often struggle to
focus on foreground areas in complex, low-contrast backgrounds, where some
malignant tumors closely resemble normal organs, complicating contextual
differentiation. To address these challenges, we propose the Foreground-Aware
Spectrum Segmentation (FASS) framework. First, we introduce a foreground-aware
module to amplify the distinction between background and the entire volume
space, allowing the model to concentrate more effectively on target areas.
Next, a feature-level frequency enhancement module, based on wavelet transform,
extracts discriminative high-frequency features to enhance boundary recognition
and detail perception. Eventually, we introduce an edge constraint module to
preserve geometric continuity in segmentation boundaries. Extensive experiments
on multiple medical datasets demonstrate superior performance across all
metrics, validating the effectiveness of our framework, particularly in
robustness under complex conditions and fine structure recognition. Our
framework significantly enhances segmentation of low-contrast images, paving
the way for applications in more diverse and complex medical imaging scenarios.

Motivation: Current LLMs and VLMs struggle with mathematical problems that require visual assistance like drawing auxiliary lines or plotting functions, as they are limited to text-only reasoning chains and lack precision in multimodal generation.

Method: 1) Created Math-VR, a large-scale bilingual dataset with 178K samples for mathematics with visual reasoning; 2) Developed an image-to-code converter to parse mathematical figures into code; 3) Trained CodePlot-CoT model using this data to generate both text reasoning and executable plotting code.

Result: The model achieved up to 21% improvement over base models on the new Math-VR benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of the code-driven reasoning paradigm for mathematical visual reasoning.

Conclusion: CodePlot-CoT opens a new direction for multimodal mathematical reasoning by enabling "thinking with images" through code generation, and provides the community with the first large-scale dataset, benchmark, and strong approach for such problems.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models
(VLMs) have shown significant progress in mathematical reasoning, yet they
still face a critical bottleneck with problems requiring visual assistance,
such as drawing auxiliary lines or plotting functions to solve the problems.
Most LLMs and VLMs are constrained to text-only reasoning chains, while
multimodal unified models that can generate interleaved text and images lack
the necessary precision and controllability for such tasks. To address this, we
propose CodePlot-CoT, a code-driven Chain-of-Thought paradigm for "thinking
with images" in mathematics. Our approach leverages the VLM to generate text
reasoning as well as executable plotting code, which is then rendered into
images as "visual thought", to solve mathematical problems. To achieve this, we
first construct Math-VR, the first large-scale, bilingual dataset and benchmark
for Mathematics problems with Visual Reasoning, comprising 178K samples.
Second, to create high-quality training data, we develop a state-of-the-art
image-to-code converter specialized for parsing complex mathematical figures

achieves up to 21% increase over base model on our new benchmark, fully
validating the efficacy of our proposed code-driven reasoning paradigm. Our

*Sanchit Sinha,Guangzhi Xiong,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COCO-Tree improves VLMs' compositional reasoning by augmenting them with neurosymbolic concept trees learned from LLMs, boosting performance by 5-10% on benchmarks while providing interpretable rationales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with compositional reasoning involving multiple objects, attributes, and relations. Existing approaches either use resource-intensive LLM integration or lack interpretability.

Method: COCO-Tree uses beam search-inspired reasoning with neurosymbolic concept trees learned from LLMs to augment VLM outputs, providing interpretable reasoning processes.

Result: Significant improvement of 5-10% on four compositionality benchmarks (Winoground, EqBench, ColorSwap, SugarCrepe) across seven different VLMs of varying sizes.

Conclusion: COCO-Tree effectively enhances VLMs' compositional generalization while providing interpretable reasoning, addressing key limitations of current approaches.

Abstract: Compositional reasoning remains a persistent weakness of modern vision
language models (VLMs): they often falter when a task hinges on understanding
how multiple objects, attributes, and relations interact within an image.
Multiple research works have attempted to improve compositionality performance
by creative tricks such as improving prompt structure, chain of thought
reasoning, etc. A more recent line of work attempts to impart additional
reasoning in VLMs using well-trained Large Language Models (LLMs), which are
far superior in linguistic understanding than VLMs to compensate for the
limited linguistic prowess of VLMs. However, these approaches are either
resource-intensive or do not provide an interpretable reasoning process. In
this paper, we present 'COCO-Tree' - a novel approach that augments VLM outputs
with carefully designed neurosymbolic concept trees learned from LLMs to
improve VLM's linguistic reasoning. COCO-Tree's beam search-inspired reasoning
process boosts compositionality performance and provides a rationale behind VLM
predictions. Empirical results on four compositionality benchmarks, Winoground,
EqBench, ColorSwap, and SugarCrepe, in seven different open-source VLMs with
varying sizes, demonstrate that COCO-Tree significantly improves compositional
generalization by 5-10% over baselines.

### [161] [High-Resolution Spatiotemporal Modeling with Global-Local State Space Models for Video-Based Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11017)
*Runyang Feng,Hyung Jin Chang,Tze Ho Elden Tse,Boeun Kim,Yi Chang,Yixing Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework that extends Mamba (state space models) to separately learn global and local spatiotemporal representations for video-based human pose estimation, achieving better performance and computational efficiency than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VHPE methods struggle to balance global dynamic contexts and local motion details within single modeling structures, and suffer from quadratic complexity when capturing global dependencies. Mamba shows potential for long-range modeling with linear complexity but is limited to 1D data.

Method: Proposes two extensions of Mamba: Global Spatiotemporal Mamba with 6D selective space-time scan and spatial-temporal modulated scan merging for global representations, and Local Refinement Mamba with windowed space-time scan for local keypoint motion details.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art VHPE approaches while achieving better computational trade-offs.

Conclusion: The framework successfully extends Mamba for VHPE by separately modeling global and local spatiotemporal representations, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Modeling high-resolution spatiotemporal representations, including both
global dynamic contexts (e.g., holistic human motion tendencies) and local
motion details (e.g., high-frequency changes of keypoints), is essential for
video-based human pose estimation (VHPE). Current state-of-the-art methods
typically unify spatiotemporal learning within a single type of modeling
structure (convolution or attention-based blocks), which inherently have
difficulties in balancing global and local dynamic modeling and may bias the
network to one of them, leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, existing
VHPE models suffer from quadratic complexity when capturing global
dependencies, limiting their applicability especially for high-resolution
sequences. Recently, the state space models (known as Mamba) have demonstrated
significant potential in modeling long-range contexts with linear complexity;
however, they are restricted to 1D sequential data. In this paper, we present a
novel framework that extends Mamba from two aspects to separately learn global
and local high-resolution spatiotemporal representations for VHPE.
Specifically, we first propose a Global Spatiotemporal Mamba, which performs 6D
selective space-time scan and spatial- and temporal-modulated scan merging to
efficiently extract global representations from high-resolution sequences. We
further introduce a windowed space-time scan-based Local Refinement Mamba to
enhance the high-frequency details of localized keypoint motions. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model
outperforms state-of-the-art VHPE approaches while achieving better
computational trade-offs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GIR-Bench is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating unified multimodal models across understanding-generation consistency, reasoning-centric text-to-image generation, and multi-step reasoning in editing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The community lacks a rigorous reasoning-centric benchmark to systematically evaluate the alignment between understanding and generation, and their generalization potential in complex visual tasks.

Method: The benchmark evaluates models across three perspectives: understanding-generation consistency (GIR-Bench-UGC), reasoning-centric text-to-image generation (GIR-Bench-T2I), and multi-step reasoning in editing (GIR-Bench-Edit), with carefully designed task-specific evaluation pipelines.

Result: Unified models are more capable of reasoning-driven visual tasks but still exhibit a persistent gap between understanding and generation.

Conclusion: GIR-Bench provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating unified multimodal models, revealing that while these models show promise in reasoning tasks, significant challenges remain in achieving consistent understanding-generation alignment.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models integrate the reasoning capacity of large language
models with both image understanding and generation, showing great promise for
advanced multimodal intelligence. However, the community still lacks a rigorous
reasoning-centric benchmark to systematically evaluate the alignment between
understanding and generation, and their generalization potential in complex
visual tasks. To this end, we introduce \textbf{GIR-Bench}, a comprehensive
benchmark that evaluates unified models across three complementary
perspectives. Firstly, we investigate understanding-generation consistency
(GIR-Bench-UGC), asking whether models can consistently leverage the same
knowledge in both understanding and generation tasks. Secondly, we investigate
whether models can perform reasoning-centric text-to-image generation that
requires applying logical constraints and implicit knowledge to generate
faithful visual content (GIR-Bench-T2I). Thirdly, we evaluate whether models
can handle multi-step reasoning in editing (GIR-Bench-Edit). For each subset,
we carefully design different task-specific evaluation pipelines tailored for
each task. This enables fine-grained and interpretable evaluation while
mitigating biases from the prevalent MLLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. Extensive
ablations over various unified models and generation-only systems have shown
that: Although unified models are more capable of reasoning-driven visual
tasks, they still exhibit a persistent gap between understanding and
generation. The data and code for GIR-Bench are available at

TL;DR: Vlaser is a Vision-Language-Action model that bridges embodied reasoning with policy learning, achieving SOTA performance on embodied reasoning benchmarks and robot control tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical gap between upstream VLM-based reasoning and downstream VLA policy learning in embodied AI systems.

Method: Developed Vlaser - a foundational vision-language model integrating high-level reasoning with low-level control, built on the Vlaser-6M dataset. Systematically examined how different VLM initializations affect supervised VLA fine-tuning.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance across embodied reasoning benchmarks (spatial reasoning, embodied grounding, embodied QA, task planning) and SOTA results on WidowX benchmark with competitive performance on Google Robot benchmark.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges embodied reasoning with VLA policy learning and provides insights into mitigating domain shift between pre-training data and embodied policy learning data.

Abstract: While significant research has focused on developing embodied reasoning
capabilities using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or integrating advanced VLMs
into Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end robot control, few
studies directly address the critical gap between upstream VLM-based reasoning
and downstream VLA policy learning. In this work, we take an initial step
toward bridging embodied reasoning with VLA policy learning by introducing
Vlaser - a Vision-Language-Action Model with synergistic embodied reasoning
capability, which is a foundational vision-language model designed to integrate
high-level reasoning with low-level control for embodied agents. Built upon the
high-quality Vlaser-6M dataset, Vlaser achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a range of embodied reasoning benchmarks - including spatial reasoning,
embodied grounding, embodied QA, and task planning. Furthermore, we
systematically examine how different VLM initializations affect supervised VLA
fine-tuning, offering novel insights into mitigating the domain shift between
internet-scale pre-training data and embodied-specific policy learning data.
Based on these insights, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the
WidowX benchmark and competitive performance on the Google Robot benchmark.

*Yanning Hou,Ke Xu,Junfa Li,Yanran Ruan,Jianfeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel two-stage framework for zero-shot anomaly segmentation that leverages CLIP's anomaly localization and SAM's boundary perception, achieving state-of-the-art results with 10.3% and 7.7% improvements on Visa dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models show strong generalization for zero-shot anomaly segmentation, but effectively guiding them for downstream tasks remains challenging. The paper aims to address SAM's tendency for object segmentation rather than anomaly detection.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) Co-Feature Point Prompt Generation (PPG) module uses CLIP and SAM collaboratively to generate positive/negative point prompts that guide SAM to focus on anomalies. (2) Cascaded Prompts for SAM (CPS) module uses hybrid prompts with SAM's lightweight decoder to refine segmentation and handle rough boundaries.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot anomaly segmentation across multiple datasets. On Visa dataset, outperforms previous methods by 10.3% in F1-max and 7.7% in AP metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively combines CLIP and SAM capabilities for precise anomaly segmentation, demonstrating superior performance in zero-shot industrial anomaly detection tasks.

Abstract: Recently, the powerful generalization ability exhibited by foundation models
has brought forth new solutions for zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks.
However, guiding these foundation models correctly to address downstream tasks
remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel two-stage framework, for
zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks in industrial anomaly detection. This
framework excellently leverages the powerful anomaly localization capability of
CLIP and the boundary perception ability of SAM.(1) To mitigate SAM's
inclination towards object segmentation, we propose the Co-Feature Point Prompt
Generation (PPG) module. This module collaboratively utilizes CLIP and SAM to
generate positive and negative point prompts, guiding SAM to focus on
segmenting anomalous regions rather than the entire object. (2) To further
optimize SAM's segmentation results and mitigate rough boundaries and isolated
noise, we introduce the Cascaded Prompts for SAM (CPS) module. This module
employs hybrid prompts cascaded with a lightweight decoder of SAM, achieving
precise segmentation of anomalous regions. Across multiple datasets, consistent
experimental validation demonstrates that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art zero-shot anomaly segmentation results. Particularly
noteworthy is our performance on the Visa dataset, where we outperform the
state-of-the-art methods by 10.3\% and 7.7\% in terms of {$F_1$-max} and AP
metrics, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Laryngeal cancer imaging research lacks standardized datasets for reproducible deep learning model development, necessitating a curated benchmark to support AI-driven clinical decision making.

Method: Used 1,029 CT scans from TCIA, extracted uniform 1mm isotropic volumes using weakly supervised parameter search, and benchmarked 3D DL architectures (3D CNN, ResNet18,50,101, DenseNet121) on T-stage classification tasks.

Result: 3D CNN achieved AUC-0.881 and F1-macro-0.821 for early vs advanced classification, while ResNet18 achieved AUC-0.892 and F1-macro-0.646 for T4 vs non-T4 classification. 3D GradCAMs showed distinct activation patterns between T4 and non-T4 cases.

Conclusion: LaryngealCT provides a reproducible foundation for AI-driven laryngeal oncology research through open-source data, pretrained models, and integrated explainability tools to support clinical decisions.

Abstract: Laryngeal cancer imaging research lacks standardised datasets to enable
reproducible deep learning (DL) model development. We present LaryngealCT, a
curated benchmark of 1,029 computed tomography (CT) scans aggregated from six
collections from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Uniform 1 mm isotropic
volumes of interest encompassing the larynx were extracted using a weakly
supervised parameter search framework validated by clinical experts. 3D DL
architectures (3D CNN, ResNet18,50,101, DenseNet121) were benchmarked on (i)
early (Tis,T1,T2) vs. advanced (T3,T4) and (ii) T4 vs. non-T4 classification
tasks. 3D CNN (AUC-0.881, F1-macro-0.821) and ResNet18 (AUC-0.892,
F1-macro-0.646) respectively outperformed the other models in the two tasks.
Model explainability assessed using 3D GradCAMs with thyroid cartilage overlays
revealed greater peri-cartilage attention in non-T4 cases and focal activations

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-guided diffusion models struggle to maintain ID and structural consistency in real face editing tasks, limiting their effectiveness for practical face editing applications.

Method: Decompose face representation into ID and attribute features, using them as joint conditions to guide both inversion and reverse diffusion processes, allowing independent control over ID and attributes.

Result: The method supports complex multi-attribute face editing using only text prompts without region-specific input, operates at DDIM inversion speed, and demonstrates strong ID preservation and structural consistency.

Conclusion: The proposed zero-shot face editing method provides an effective solution for maintaining ID consistency while enabling precise facial attribute manipulation, showing practicality and effectiveness in comprehensive experiments.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-guided diffusion models have shown promise for
general image editing via inversion techniques, but often struggle to maintain
ID and structural consistency in real face editing tasks. To address this
limitation, we propose a zero-shot face editing method based on ID-Attribute
Decoupled Inversion. Specifically, we decompose the face representation into ID
and attribute features, using them as joint conditions to guide both the
inversion and the reverse diffusion processes. This allows independent control
over ID and attributes, ensuring strong ID preservation and structural
consistency while enabling precise facial attribute manipulation. Our method
supports a wide range of complex multi-attribute face editing tasks using only
text prompts, without requiring region-specific input, and operates at a speed
comparable to DDIM inversion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate its
practicality and effectiveness.

TL;DR: The 7th LSVOS Challenge at ICCV 2025 introduces a new Complex VOS track (MOSEv2) with more realistic and challenging scenarios, alongside traditional VOS and RVOS tracks, to push video object segmentation robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance video object segmentation by addressing more realistic challenges including dense small objects, disappear/reappear events, severe occlusions, and adverse conditions, pushing beyond curated benchmarks.

Method: The challenge features three tracks: Classic VOS, Referring VOS, and the new Complex VOS (MOSEv2) with increased difficulty. Standard metrics (J, F, J&F) are used for VOS/RVOS, while MOSEv2 adopts J&F-dot to better evaluate across scales and disappearance cases.

Result: The challenge highlights top-performing solutions and emerging trends including the growing role of LLM/MLLM components and memory-aware propagation in video segmentation.

Conclusion: The LSVOS Challenge aims to chart future directions for resilient, language-aware video segmentation in real-world scenarios by introducing more challenging benchmarks and tracking emerging technological trends.

Abstract: This report presents an overview of the 7th Large-scale Video Object
Segmentation (LSVOS) Challenge held in conjunction with ICCV 2025. Besides the
two traditional tracks of LSVOS that jointly target robustness in realistic
video scenarios: Classic VOS (VOS), and Referring VOS (RVOS), the 2025 edition
features a newly introduced track, Complex VOS (MOSEv2). Building upon prior
insights, MOSEv2 substantially increases difficulty, introducing more
challenging but realistic scenarios including denser small objects, frequent
disappear/reappear events, severe occlusions, adverse weather and lighting,
etc., pushing long-term consistency and generalization beyond curated
benchmarks. The challenge retains standard ${J}$, $F$, and ${J\&F}$ metrics for
VOS and RVOS, while MOSEv2 adopts ${J\&\dot{F}}$ as the primary ranking metric
to better evaluate objects across scales and disappearance cases. We summarize
datasets and protocols, highlight top-performing solutions, and distill
emerging trends, such as the growing role of LLM/MLLM components and
memory-aware propagation, aiming to chart future directions for resilient,

*Bozhou Zhang,Nan Song,Jingyu Li,Xiatian Zhu,Jiankang Deng,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeerDrive is an end-to-end autonomous driving framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory planning in a closed-loop manner, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current end-to-end autonomous driving methods operate under a one-shot paradigm that underestimates scene dynamics and temporal evolution, limiting adaptive decision-making in complex scenarios. The authors propose that vehicle trajectory and scene evolution are bidirectionally related.

Method: SeerDrive predicts future bird's-eye view (BEV) representations to anticipate scene dynamics, then uses this foresight for trajectory planning. Key components include future-aware planning (injecting predicted BEV features) and iterative scene modeling with vehicle planning for collaborative optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments on NAVSIM and nuScenes benchmarks show SeerDrive significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed closed-loop framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory planning demonstrates superior performance by leveraging the bidirectional relationship between vehicle trajectory and scene dynamics.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving methods aim to directly map raw sensor inputs
to future driving actions such as planned trajectories, bypassing traditional
modular pipelines. While these approaches have shown promise, they often
operate under a one-shot paradigm that relies heavily on the current scene
context, potentially underestimating the importance of scene dynamics and their
temporal evolution. This limitation restricts the model's ability to make
informed and adaptive decisions in complex driving scenarios. We propose a new
perspective: the future trajectory of an autonomous vehicle is closely
intertwined with the evolving dynamics of its environment, and conversely, the
vehicle's own future states can influence how the surrounding scene unfolds.
Motivated by this bidirectional relationship, we introduce SeerDrive, a novel
end-to-end framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory
planning in a closed-loop manner. Our method first predicts future bird's-eye
view (BEV) representations to anticipate the dynamics of the surrounding scene,
then leverages this foresight to generate future-context-aware trajectories.
Two key components enable this: (1) future-aware planning, which injects
predicted BEV features into the trajectory planner, and (2) iterative scene
modeling and vehicle planning, which refines both future scene prediction and
trajectory generation through collaborative optimization. Extensive experiments
on the NAVSIM and nuScenes benchmarks show that SeerDrive significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a supervised diffusion-based denoising framework to defend multimodal large language models against adversarial attacks on visual inputs, achieving higher quality reconstructions and improved robustness compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks through visual modality manipulation, while existing defenses like adversarial training and input purification have limitations in computational cost, image quality degradation, and generalization to complex multimodal tasks.

Method: Uses supervised diffusion denoising with paired adversarial-clean image datasets and directional task-specific guidance, combined with prompt optimization as complementary defense mechanism.

Result: Extensive experiments on image captioning and VQA show substantial robustness improvement and strong transferability to unknown attacks, outperforming prior methods like DiffPure.

Conclusion: Supervised diffusion-based denoising effectively enhances multimodal defense, enabling more reliable deployment of MLLMs in real-world applications.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, and cross-modal
reasoning by integrating visual and textual modalities. However, their
multimodal nature also exposes them to adversarial threats, where attackers can
perturb either modality or both jointly to induce harmful, misleading, or
policy violating outputs. Existing defense strategies, such as adversarial
training and input purification, face notable limitations: adversarial training
typically improves robustness only against known attacks while incurring high
computational costs, whereas conventional purification approaches often suffer
from degraded image quality and insufficient generalization to complex
multimodal tasks.
  In this work, we focus on defending the visual modality, which frequently
serves as the primary entry point for adversarial manipulation. We propose a
supervised diffusion based denoising framework that leverages paired
adversarial clean image datasets to fine-tune diffusion models with
directional, task specific guidance. Unlike prior unsupervised purification
methods such as DiffPure, our approach achieves higher quality reconstructions
while significantly improving defense robustness in multimodal tasks.
Furthermore, we incorporate prompt optimization as a complementary defense
mechanism, enhancing resistance against diverse and unseen attack strategies.
  Extensive experiments on image captioning and visual question answering
demonstrate that our method not only substantially improves robustness but also
exhibits strong transferability to unknown adversarial attacks. These results
highlight the effectiveness of supervised diffusion based denoising for
multimodal defense, paving the way for more reliable and secure deployment of
MLLMs in real world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CZSL addresses the combinatorial challenge of recognizing unseen attribute-object combinations by leveraging known primitives, which is crucial since visual appearances are highly contextual and compositional.

Method: The survey systematically reviews CZSL methods using a taxonomy grounded in disentanglement, categorizing approaches into four families: no explicit disentanglement, textual disentanglement, visual disentanglement, and cross-modal disentanglement.

Result: The paper provides a detailed comparative analysis of CZSL methods, highlighting their advantages and limitations in different settings like closed-world and open-world scenarios, and identifies significant open challenges.

Conclusion: This survey serves as a foundational resource to guide and inspire further advancements in CZSL by systematically organizing the field and outlining promising future research directions.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) is a critical task in computer vision
that enables models to recognize unseen combinations of known attributes and
objects during inference, addressing the combinatorial challenge of requiring
training data for every possible composition. This is particularly challenging
because the visual appearance of primitives is highly contextual; for example,
``small'' cats appear visually distinct from ``older'' ones, and ``wet'' cars
differ significantly from ``wet'' cats. Effectively modeling this contextuality
and the inherent compositionality is crucial for robust compositional zero-shot
recognition. This paper presents, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive
survey specifically focused on Compositional Zero-Shot Learning. We
systematically review the state-of-the-art CZSL methods, introducing a taxonomy
grounded in disentanglement, with four families of approaches: no explicit
disentanglement, textual disentanglement, visual disentanglement, and
cross-modal disentanglement. We provide a detailed comparative analysis of
these methods, highlighting their core advantages and limitations in different
problem settings, such as closed-world and open-world CZSL. Finally, we
identify the most significant open challenges and outline promising future
research directions. This survey aims to serve as a foundational resource to
guide and inspire further advancements in this fascinating and important field.

Motivation: To address the challenge of learning semantically meaningful 3D motion priors from real-world videos for predicting future 3D scene motion from single input images.

Method: Proposes a novel pixel-aligned Motion Map (MoMap) representation, creates a large-scale database from 50,000+ real videos, and trains a diffusion model on these representations. Also introduces a pipeline for 2D video synthesis by first generating MoMaps then warping images.

Result: The approach generates plausible and semantically consistent 3D scene motion, demonstrating effective motion prediction capabilities.

Conclusion: MoMap representation enables efficient and effective 3D motion prediction from single images, with potential applications in both 3D motion synthesis and 2D video generation.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of learning semantically and functionally
meaningful 3D motion priors from real-world videos, in order to enable
prediction of future 3D scene motion from a single input image. We propose a
novel pixel-aligned Motion Map (MoMap) representation for 3D scene motion,
which can be generated from existing generative image models to facilitate
efficient and effective motion prediction. To learn meaningful distributions
over motion, we create a large-scale database of MoMaps from over 50,000 real
videos and train a diffusion model on these representations. Our motion
generation not only synthesizes trajectories in 3D but also suggests a new
pipeline for 2D video synthesis: first generate a MoMap, then warp an image
accordingly and complete the warped point-based renderings. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach generates plausible and semantically
consistent 3D scene motion.

*Chen Liu,Wenfang Yao,Kejing Yin,William K. Cheung,Jing Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiPro is a framework that disentangles static and dynamic features in sequential chest X-rays and aligns them with EHR data to model disease progression, achieving state-of-the-art performance on clinical prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Longitudinal multimodal data (EHR and sequential CXRs) is underutilized due to redundancy in CXR sequences and temporal misalignment between sparse imaging and continuous EHR data.

Method: Uses region-aware disentanglement to separate static (anatomy) and dynamic (pathology progression) features in CXRs, then hierarchically aligns these features with EHR data via local (interval-level) and global (sequence-level) synchronization.

Result: Extensive experiments on MIMIC dataset show DiPro effectively extracts temporal clinical dynamics and achieves state-of-the-art performance on disease progression identification and ICU prediction tasks.

Conclusion: DiPro successfully addresses key challenges in multimodal longitudinal data analysis through disentanglement and multi-timescale alignment, enabling better modeling of disease progression pathways.

Abstract: Longitudinal multimodal data, including electronic health records (EHR) and
sequential chest X-rays (CXRs), is critical for modeling disease progression,
yet remains underutilized due to two key challenges: (1) redundancy in
consecutive CXR sequences, where static anatomical regions dominate over
clinically-meaningful dynamics, and (2) temporal misalignment between sparse,
irregular imaging and continuous EHR data. We introduce $\texttt{DiPro}$, a
novel framework that addresses these challenges through region-aware
disentanglement and multi-timescale alignment. First, we disentangle static
(anatomy) and dynamic (pathology progression) features in sequential CXRs,
prioritizing disease-relevant changes. Second, we hierarchically align these
static and dynamic CXR features with asynchronous EHR data via local (pairwise
interval-level) and global (full-sequence) synchronization to model coherent
progression pathways. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC dataset demonstrate
that $\texttt{DiPro}$ could effectively extract temporal clinical dynamics and
achieve state-of-the-art performance on both disease progression identification
and general ICU prediction tasks.

*Hao Tang,Shengfeng He,Jing Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynTrans is a novel few-shot learning framework that transfers diverse knowledge from large multimodal models to enhance few-shot learners through synergistic knowledge mining and bi-directional visual-semantic knowledge transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-shot learning methods that leverage semantic knowledge often introduce noise and bias due to data simplicity, creating a need for more robust knowledge transfer approaches.

Method: Uses CLIP as teacher and few-shot vision encoder as student for knowledge distillation, employs synergistic knowledge mining module for collaboration among multimodal models, implements visual-semantic bridging for bi-directional knowledge transfer, and uses visual weight generator and semantic weight reconstructor to construct optimal classifiers.

Result: Significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on four FSL datasets, even when paired with a simple few-shot vision encoder.

Conclusion: SynTrans effectively addresses few-shot learning challenges by synergistically transferring high-quality multimodal knowledge, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses the challenge of classifying novel classes
with limited training samples. While some methods leverage semantic knowledge
from smaller-scale models to mitigate data scarcity, these approaches often
introduce noise and bias due to the data's inherent simplicity. In this paper,
we propose a novel framework, Synergistic Knowledge Transfer (SynTrans), which
effectively transfers diverse and complementary knowledge from large multimodal
models to empower the off-the-shelf few-shot learner. Specifically, SynTrans
employs CLIP as a robust teacher and uses a few-shot vision encoder as a weak
student, distilling semantic-aligned visual knowledge via an unsupervised proxy
task. Subsequently, a training-free synergistic knowledge mining module
facilitates collaboration among large multimodal models to extract high-quality
semantic knowledge. Building upon this, a visual-semantic bridging module
enables bi-directional knowledge transfer between visual and semantic spaces,
transforming explicit visual and implicit semantic knowledge into
category-specific classifier weights. Finally, SynTrans introduces a visual
weight generator and a semantic weight reconstructor to adaptively construct
optimal multimodal FSL classifiers. Experimental results on four FSL datasets
demonstrate that SynTrans, even when paired with a simple few-shot vision
encoder, significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

*Yaqi Zhao,Xiaochen Wang,Li Dong,Wentao Zhang,Yuhui Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion models struggle with counting objects accurately despite scaling up datasets and models. The study shows noise initialization bias affects numerosity, and proposes count-aware layout injection to significantly improve counting accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether scaling up datasets and model size alone can solve numerosity problems in text-to-image generation, and understand why current models fail at accurate counting.

Method: Created two synthetic benchmarks (GrayCount250 and NaturalCount6), analyzed noise initialization biases, and proposed injecting count-aware layout information into noise priors.

Result: Scaling alone doesn't improve counting accuracy. Proposed method boosted accuracy from 20.0% to 85.3% on GrayCount250 and from 74.8% to 86.3% on NaturalCount6.

Conclusion: Noise initialization bias is a key limitation for numerosity in diffusion models, and explicit count-aware layout control effectively addresses this problem.

Abstract: Numerosity remains a challenge for state-of-the-art text-to-image generation
models like FLUX and GPT-4o, which often fail to accurately follow counting
instructions in text prompts. In this paper, we aim to study a fundamental yet
often overlooked question: Can diffusion models inherently generate the correct
number of objects specified by a textual prompt simply by scaling up the
dataset and model size? To enable rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we
construct a clean synthetic numerosity benchmark comprising two complementary
datasets: GrayCount250 for controlled scaling studies, and NaturalCount6
featuring complex naturalistic scenes. Second, we empirically show that the
scaling hypothesis does not hold: larger models and datasets alone fail to
improve counting accuracy on our benchmark. Our analysis identifies a key
reason: diffusion models tend to rely heavily on the noise initialization
rather than the explicit numerosity specified in the prompt. We observe that
noise priors exhibit biases toward specific object counts. In addition, we
propose an effective strategy for controlling numerosity by injecting
count-aware layout information into the noise prior. Our method achieves
significant gains, improving accuracy on GrayCount250 from 20.0\% to 85.3\% and
on NaturalCount6 from 74.8\% to 86.3\%, demonstrating effective generalization
across settings.

TL;DR: AI tool using phase contrast microscopy and ensemble learning to detect sperm DNA fragmentation with 60% sensitivity and 75% specificity, validated against TUNEL assay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional semen analysis fails to evaluate sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF), which is critical for male fertility assessment. Current methods require destructive testing, limiting clinical applications.

Method: Developed a morphology-assisted ensemble AI model combining image processing with transformer-based machine learning (GC-ViT) to predict DNA fragmentation from phase contrast microscopy images. Benchmarking against pure transformer and morphology-only models.

Result: Achieved 60% sensitivity and 75% specificity in detecting sperm DNA fragmentation. The ensemble model outperformed both pure transformer and morphology-only approaches.

Conclusion: This non-destructive AI methodology enables real-time sperm selection based on DNA integrity, representing a significant advancement in reproductive medicine for clinical diagnostics and therapeutic applications.

Abstract: Sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) is a critical parameter in male fertility
assessment that conventional semen analysis fails to evaluate. This study
presents the validation of a novel artificial intelligence (AI) tool designed
to detect SDF through digital analysis of phase contrast microscopy images,
using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)
assay as the gold standard reference. Utilising the established link between
sperm morphology and DNA integrity, the present work proposes a morphology
assisted ensemble AI model that combines image processing techniques with
state-of-the-art transformer based machine learning models (GC-ViT) for the
prediction of DNA fragmentation in sperm from phase contrast images. The
ensemble model is benchmarked against a pure transformer `vision' model as well
as a `morphology-only` model. Promising results show the proposed framework is
able to achieve sensitivity of 60\% and specificity of 75\%. This
non-destructive methodology represents a significant advancement in
reproductive medicine by enabling real-time sperm selection based on DNA
integrity for clinical diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

### [177] [Multiview Manifold Evidential Fusion for PolSAR Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11171)
*Junfei Shi,Haojia Zhang,Haiyan Jin,Junhuai Li,Xiaogang Song,Yuanfan Guo,Haonan Su,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMEFnet is a novel fusion method for PolSAR classification that integrates covariance matrices on HPD manifold and multi-features on Grassmann manifold, using kernel metric learning and Dempster-Shafer theory for reliable uncertainty-aware fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PolSAR fusion methods ignore the different geometric structures of covariance matrices and multi-features, overlook view importance variations, and lack uncertainty quantification, leading to unreliable predictions.

Method: Proposes MMEFnet with: 1) Covariance matrices on HPD manifold and multi-features on Grassmann manifold, 2) Two kernel metric learning networks for manifold representations, 3) Trusted multiview evidence fusion replacing softmax, 4) Dempster-Shafer theory-based fusion strategy.

Result: Extensive experiments on three real-world PolSAR datasets show the method consistently outperforms existing approaches in accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

Conclusion: MMEFnet effectively addresses the limitations of traditional fusion methods by considering manifold structures, view importance, and uncertainty, providing a more reliable and interpretable PolSAR classification framework.

Abstract: Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) covariance matrices and their
extracted multi-features - such as scattering angle, entropy, texture, and
boundary descriptors - provide complementary and physically interpretable
information for image classification. Traditional fusion strategies typically
concatenate these features or employ deep learning networks to combine them.
However, the covariance matrices and multi-features, as two complementary
views, lie on different manifolds with distinct geometric structures. Existing
fusion methods also overlook the varying importance of different views and
ignore uncertainty, often leading to unreliable predictions. To address these
issues, we propose a Multiview Manifold Evidential Fusion (MMEFnet) method to
effectively fuse these two views. It gives a new framework to integrate PolSAR
manifold learning and evidence fusion into a unified architecture.
Specifically, covariance matrices are represented on the Hermitian Positive
Definite (HPD) manifold, while multi-features are modeled on the Grassmann
manifold. Two different kernel metric learning networks are constructed to
learn their manifold representations. Subsequently, a trusted multiview
evidence fusion, replacing the conventional softmax classifier, estimates
belief mass and quantifies the uncertainty of each view from the learned deep
features. Finally, a Dempster-Shafer theory-based fusion strategy combines
evidence, enabling a more reliable and interpretable classification. Extensive
experiments on three real-world PolSAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method consistently outperforms existing approaches in accuracy, robustness,
and interpretability.

*Zhenyu Lu,Liupeng Li,Jinpeng Wang,Yan Feng,Bin Chen,Ke Chen,Yaowei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoPRS introduces a Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought based positional perception model that bridges language reasoning to segmentation through a differentiable heatmap interface, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reasoning segmentation methods either connect language model features directly to mask decoders or use text position representations, which limits interpretability and semantic detail.

Method: CoPRS uses a Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought approach to generate a differentiable positional prior as a heatmap, with a learnable concentration token that aggregates image and reasoning text features, then decoded to masks through a lightweight decoder.

Result: CoPRS matches or surpasses best reported metrics on RefCOCO series and ReasonSeg datasets under comparable protocols, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both validation and test partitions.

Conclusion: The heatmap quality strongly influences mask quality, supporting consistent association between reasoning output and mask generation, demonstrating advantages in concentration driven by reasoning for more precise mask prediction.

Abstract: Existing works on reasoning segmentation either connect hidden features from
a language model directly to a mask decoder or represent positions in text,
which limits interpretability and semantic detail. To solve this, we present
CoPRS, a Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT)-based positional perception model
that bridges language reasoning to segmentation through a differentiable and
interpretable positional prior instantiated as a heatmap. By making the
reasoning process clear via MCoT and expressing it as a dense, differentiable
heatmap, this interface enhances interpretability and diagnostic analysis and
yields more concentrated evidence on the target. A learnable concentration
token aggregates features of the image and reasoning text to generate this
positional prior, which is decoded to precise masks through a lightweight
decoder, providing a direct connection between reasoning and segmentation.
Across the RefCOCO series and ReasonSeg, CoPRS matches or surpasses the best
reported metrics on each standard split under comparable protocols, with
performance at or above prior state of the art across both validation and test
partitions. Extensive experiments reveal that the quality of the heatmap
strongly influences the resulting mask quality, supporting a consistent
association between the reasoning output and downstream mask generation.
Collectively, these findings support the utility of this paradigm in bridging
reasoning and segmentation and show advantages in concentration driven by
reasoning and predicting masks more precisely. Code, checkpoints and logs are
released at https://github.com/ZhenyuLU-Heliodore/CoPRS.git.

### [179] [Reliable Cross-modal Alignment via Prototype Iterative Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11175)
*Xiang Ma,Litian Xu,Lexin Fang,Caiming Zhang,Lizhen Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PICO is a novel framework that suppresses style interference in cross-modal alignment by quantifying semantic probability of feature columns and using performance feedback to iteratively construct prototypes, achieving significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional cross-modal alignment methods assume embeddings contain only semantic information, ignoring non-semantic style variations that cause information bias and loss. There's a need to separate style from semantics during alignment.

Method: PICO quantifies the probability of each feature column representing semantic information and uses this as weight during embedding interaction. It employs a prototype iterative construction method with a performance feedback-based weighting function that theoretically assigns higher weights to prototypes bringing better performance.

Result: Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and model backbones show PICO outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 5.2%-14.1%.

Conclusion: PICO effectively suppresses style interference in cross-modal alignment through semantic probability quantification and iterative prototype construction, demonstrating superior performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment is an important multi-modal task, aiming to bridge the
semantic gap between different modalities. The most reliable fundamention for
achieving this objective lies in the semantic consistency between matched
pairs. Conventional methods implicitly assume embeddings contain solely
semantic information, ignoring the impact of non-semantic information during
alignment, which inevitably leads to information bias or even loss. These
non-semantic information primarily manifest as stylistic variations in the
data, which we formally define as style information. An intuitive approach is
to separate style from semantics, aligning only the semantic information.
However, most existing methods distinguish them based on feature columns, which
cannot represent the complex coupling relationship between semantic and style
information. In this paper, we propose PICO, a novel framework for suppressing
style interference during embedding interaction. Specifically, we quantify the
probability of each feature column representing semantic information, and
regard it as the weight during the embedding interaction. To ensure the
reliability of the semantic probability, we propose a prototype iterative
construction method. The key operation of this method is a performance
feedback-based weighting function, and we have theoretically proven that the
function can assign higher weight to prototypes that bring higher performance
improvements. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and model backbones
demonstrate the superiority of PICO, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by
5.2\%-14.1\%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BLEnD-Vis is a multimodal benchmark that evaluates cultural understanding in VLMs across linguistic rephrasings and visual modalities, revealing significant fragility in current models' cultural knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLM evaluations focus on static recall or isolated visual grounding, leaving gaps in assessing robust and transferable cultural understanding as VLMs are deployed globally.

Method: Built on BLEnD dataset, BLEnD-Vis constructs 313 culturally grounded question templates across 16 regions, generating three aligned multiple-choice formats: text-only baseline, inverted text-only variant, and VQA-style version with generated images.

Result: The benchmark (4,916 images, 21,000+ MCQs) reveals significant performance drops under linguistic rephrasing, low cross-modal consistency, and challenges in integrating textual and visual understanding, especially for lower-resource regions.

Conclusion: BLEnD-Vis provides a crucial testbed for analyzing cultural robustness and multimodal grounding, exposing limitations and guiding development of more culturally competent VLMs.

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) are deployed globally, their ability to
understand culturally situated knowledge becomes essential. Yet, existing
evaluations largely assess static recall or isolated visual grounding, leaving
unanswered whether VLMs possess robust and transferable cultural understanding.
We introduce BLEnD-Vis, a multimodal, multicultural benchmark designed to
evaluate the robustness of everyday cultural knowledge in VLMs across
linguistic rephrasings and visual modalities. Building on the BLEnD dataset,
BLEnD-Vis constructs 313 culturally grounded question templates spanning 16
regions and generates three aligned multiple-choice formats: (i) a text-only
baseline querying from Region $\to$ Entity, (ii) an inverted text-only variant
(Entity $\to$ Region), and (iii) a VQA-style version of (ii) with generated
images. The resulting benchmark comprises 4,916 images and over 21,000
multiple-choice question (MCQ) instances, validated through human annotation.
BLEnD-Vis reveals significant fragility in current VLM cultural knowledge;
models exhibit performance drops under linguistic rephrasing and, whilst visual
cues often aid performance, low cross-modal consistency highlights challenges
in robustly integrating textual and visual understanding, particularly for
lower-resource regions. BLEnD-Vis thus provides a crucial testbed for
systematically analysing cultural robustness and multimodal grounding, exposing
limitations and guiding the development of more culturally competent VLMs.

Abstract: This paper explores the application of T5 models for Saudi Sign Language
(SSL) translation using a novel dataset. The SSL dataset includes three
challenging testing protocols, enabling comprehensive evaluation across
different scenarios. Additionally, it captures unique SSL characteristics, such
as face coverings, which pose challenges for sign recognition and translation.
In our experiments, we investigate the impact of pre-training on American Sign

demonstrate that pre-training on YouTubeASL significantly improves models'
performance (roughly $3\times$ in BLEU-4), indicating cross-linguistic

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlexAC is a training-free framework that enables flexible control over associative reasoning in multimodal LLMs by modulating middle-layer representations using hallucination-guided steering vectors, achieving significant improvements in both creativity and factual accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs face a fundamental trade-off between faithfulness and creativity, but existing methods lack the flexibility to modulate associative reasoning strength for different tasks, limiting adaptability across factual and creative scenarios.

Method: FlexAC induces hallucination-guided intermediate representations to encode associative directions, selects high-association instances to construct steering vectors, adaptively calibrates their strengths, and incorporates task-specific vectors from target-domain samples for multi-dimensional associative reasoning.

Result: Achieves up to 5.8x improvement in creativity on Creation-MMBench and 29% reduction in hallucination rate on CHAIR, surpassing existing baselines in flexible associative reasoning control.

Conclusion: FlexAC effectively enables flexible control over associative reasoning in MLLMs, bridging the gap between factual faithfulness and creative generation through lightweight, training-free modulation of internal representations.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) face an inherent trade-off between
faithfulness and creativity, as different tasks require varying degrees of
associative reasoning. However, existing methods lack the flexibility to
modulate this reasoning strength, limiting MLLMs' adaptability across factual
and creative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose equipping MLLMs with
mechanisms that enable flexible control over associative reasoning. We begin by
investigating the internal mechanisms underlying associative behavior in MLLMs
and find that: (1) middle layers play a pivotal role in shaping model's
associative tendencies, (2) modifying representations in these layers
effectively regulates associative reasoning strength, and (3) hallucinations
can be exploited to derive steering vectors that guide this modulation.
Building on these findings, we introduce Flexible Association Control (FlexAC),
a lightweight and training-free framework for modulating associative behavior
in MLLMs. FlexAC first induces hallucination-guided intermediate
representations to encode associative directions. Then, it selects
high-association instances to construct effective associative steering vectors,
whose strengths are adaptively calibrated to balance creative guidance with
output stability. Finally, recognizing the multi-dimensional nature of
associative reasoning, FlexAC incorporates task-specific associative vectors
derived from a forward pass on a few target-domain samples, enabling models to
follow diverse associative directions and better adapt to creative tasks.
Notably, our method achieves up to a 5.8x improvement in creativity on
Creation-MMBench and a 29% reduction in hallucination rate on CHAIR, surpassing
existing baselines and demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling flexible
control over associative reasoning in MLLMs. Our code is available at

TL;DR: This paper presents a multimodal contrastive learning approach for detecting fine-grained educational content in online videos, focusing on literacy and math skills for early childhood education.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing consumption of online media by children requires data-driven tools to filter appropriate educational content for young learners, particularly literacy and math content.

Method: Proposes a class prototypes-based supervised contrastive learning approach with multimodal transformer networks to capture visual-audio interactions, treating the problem as fine-grained multilabel classification.

Result: The approach outperforms strong baselines on the APPROVE dataset (193 hours of expert-annotated videos with 19 classes) and other benchmarks like YouTube-8M and COIN.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal contrastive learning framework effectively detects fine-grained educational content in videos and the APPROVE dataset provides a valuable resource for educational content analysis.

Abstract: The recent growth in the consumption of online media by children during early
childhood necessitates data-driven tools enabling educators to filter out
appropriate educational content for young learners. This paper presents an
approach for detecting educational content in online videos. We focus on two
widely used educational content classes: literacy and math. For each class, we
choose prominent codes (sub-classes) based on the Common Core Standards. For
example, literacy codes include `letter names', `letter sounds', and math codes
include `counting', `sorting'. We pose this as a fine-grained multilabel
classification problem as videos can contain multiple types of educational
content and the content classes can get visually similar (e.g., `letter names'
vs `letter sounds'). We propose a novel class prototypes based supervised
contrastive learning approach that can handle fine-grained samples associated
with multiple labels. We learn a class prototype for each class and a loss
function is employed to minimize the distances between a class prototype and
the samples from the class. Similarly, distances between a class prototype and
the samples from other classes are maximized. As the alignment between visual
and audio cues are crucial for effective comprehension, we consider a
multimodal transformer network to capture the interaction between visual and
audio cues in videos while learning the embedding for videos. For evaluation,
we present a dataset, APPROVE, employing educational videos from YouTube
labeled with fine-grained education classes by education researchers. APPROVE
consists of 193 hours of expert-annotated videos with 19 classes. The proposed
approach outperforms strong baselines on APPROVE and other benchmarks such as
Youtube-8M, and COIN. The dataset is available at

Motivation: To investigate whether people can be identified purely through the dynamic components of their facial expressions, independent of static facial appearance, which has implications for understanding person-specific signatures in social interactions.

Method: Used FLAME 3D morphable model to disentangle facial shape and expression dynamics, extracting frame-by-frame parameters from conversational videos while keeping only expression and jaw coefficients. Applied Conformer model with supervised contrastive learning on the CANDOR dataset of 1,429 speakers.

Result: Achieved 61.14% accuracy on 1,429-way classification (458 times above chance), demonstrating strong identity signatures in facial dynamics. Introduced drift-to-noise ratio (DNR) that negatively correlates with recognition performance, confirming that unstable shape estimation compromises dynamic identification.

Conclusion: Facial dynamics carry strong person-specific signatures in conversational contexts, with important implications for social perception and clinical assessment applications.

Abstract: This work investigates whether individuals can be identified solely through
the pure dynamical components of their facial expressions, independent of
static facial appearance. We leverage the FLAME 3D morphable model to achieve
explicit disentanglement between facial shape and expression dynamics,
extracting frame-by-frame parameters from conversational videos while retaining
only expression and jaw coefficients. On the CANDOR dataset of 1,429 speakers
in naturalistic conversations, our Conformer model with supervised contrastive
learning achieves 61.14\%accuracy on 1,429-way classification -- 458 times
above chance -- demonstrating that facial dynamics carry strong identity
signatures. We introduce a drift-to-noise ratio (DNR) that quantifies the
reliability of shape expression separation by measuring across-session shape
changes relative to within-session variability. DNR strongly negatively
correlates with recognition performance, confirming that unstable shape
estimation compromises dynamic identification. Our findings reveal
person-specific signatures in conversational facial dynamics, with implications
for social perception and clinical assessment.

Motivation: Current medical image segmentation methods struggle with limited structural representation and insufficient contextual modeling, which affects generalization in complex clinical scenarios.

Method: Proposed DTEA model with Semantic Topology Reconfiguration (STR) module that reorganizes multi-scale semantic features into dynamic hypergraph to model cross-resolution anatomical dependencies, and Entropic Perturbation Gating (EPG) module that assesses channel stability after perturbation and filters high-entropy channels to emphasize clinically important regions.

Result: Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show superior segmentation accuracy and better generalization across various clinical settings.

Conclusion: The DTEA framework with STR and EPG modules effectively addresses structural representation and contextual modeling challenges in medical image segmentation, achieving improved performance and generalization.

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, skip connections are used to merge global
context and reduce the semantic gap between encoder and decoder. Current
methods often struggle with limited structural representation and insufficient
contextual modeling, affecting generalization in complex clinical scenarios. We
propose the DTEA model, featuring a new skip connection framework with the
Semantic Topology Reconfiguration (STR) and Entropic Perturbation Gating (EPG)

hypergraph to better model cross-resolution anatomical dependencies, enhancing
structural and semantic representation. EPG assesses channel stability after
perturbation and filters high-entropy channels to emphasize clinically
important regions and improve spatial attention. Extensive experiments on three

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing classifier editing methods are limited - they either focus narrowly on error correction or require expensive retraining, creating bottlenecks for flexible model editing in image classification.

Method: Introduces Class Vectors that capture class-specific representation adjustments during fine-tuning, disentangling each class's adaptation in latent space. These vectors can steer latent features or map to weight space to update decision boundaries.

Result: Class Vectors demonstrate linearity and orthogonality properties that support efficient concept editing via simple class arithmetic. They effectively capture semantic shifts and enable various applications.

Conclusion: Class Vectors provide a novel approach for flexible, efficient post-hoc editing of image classifiers, overcoming limitations of existing methods and enabling applications like unlearning, environmental adaptation, and adversarial defense.

Abstract: Image classifiers play a critical role in detecting diseases in medical
imaging and identifying anomalies in manufacturing processes. However, their
predefined behaviors after extensive training make post hoc model editing
difficult, especially when it comes to forgetting specific classes or adapting
to distribution shifts. Existing classifier editing methods either focus
narrowly on correcting errors or incur extensive retraining costs, creating a
bottleneck for flexible editing. Moreover, such editing has seen limited
investigation in image classification. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce Class Vectors, which capture class-specific representation
adjustments during fine-tuning. Whereas task vectors encode task-level changes
in weight space, Class Vectors disentangle each class's adaptation in the
latent space. We show that Class Vectors capture each class's semantic shift
and that classifier editing can be achieved either by steering latent features
along these vectors or by mapping them into weight space to update the decision
boundaries. We also demonstrate that the inherent linearity and orthogonality
of Class Vectors support efficient, flexible, and high-level concept editing
via simple class arithmetic. Finally, we validate their utility in applications
such as unlearning, environmental adaptation, adversarial defense, and
adversarial trigger optimization.

TL;DR: EEMS is a medical image segmentation model that combines edge-aware enhancement and multi-scale prompt generation to improve boundary definition and target localization, achieving superior performance on datasets like ISIC2018.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation faces challenges from ambiguous edges and background noise, which affect diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring accuracy.

Method: EEMS integrates three key components: Edge-Aware Enhancement Unit (EAEU) for multi-frequency edge feature extraction, Multi-scale Prompt Generation Unit (MSPGU) for semantic-spatial feature integration via prompt guidance, and Dual-Source Adaptive Gated Fusion Unit (DAGFU) to merge edge and semantic features.

Result: Tests on ISIC2018 and other datasets confirm EEMS's superior segmentation performance and reliability as a clinical tool.

Conclusion: EEMS provides an effective solution for medical image segmentation by enhancing edge perception and precise target localization through its integrated architecture.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is vital for diagnosis, treatment planning, and
disease monitoring but is challenged by complex factors like ambiguous edges
and background noise. We introduce EEMS, a new model for segmentation,
combining an Edge-Aware Enhancement Unit (EAEU) and a Multi-scale Prompt
Generation Unit (MSPGU). EAEU enhances edge perception via multi-frequency
feature extraction, accurately defining boundaries. MSPGU integrates high-level
semantic and low-level spatial features using a prompt-guided approach,
ensuring precise target localization. The Dual-Source Adaptive Gated Fusion
Unit (DAGFU) merges edge features from EAEU with semantic features from MSPGU,
enhancing segmentation accuracy and robustness. Tests on datasets like ISIC2018

*Jian Lan,Zhicheng Liu,Udo Schlegel,Raoyuan Zhao,Yihong Liu,Hinrich Schütze,Michael A. Hedderich,Thomas Seidl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HaDola is a human uncertainty-aware framework that improves VLM training by selectively using high-uncertainty samples and automatic labeling, reducing annotation costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard supervised fine-tuning ignores human uncertainty distributions in annotations, leading to under-calibrated models and inefficient use of training data.

Method: Four-stage framework: discriminate harmful samples, self-annotate, error trigger detection, and iterative training with only 5% seed data.

Result: Outperforms SOTA baselines on VQAv2 and VizWiz with less training data, improves model calibration and accuracy.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling human uncertainty is more effective than scaling dataset size, enabling cost-efficient VLM training.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance in Visual
Question Answering but still rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with
massive labeled datasets, which is costly due to human annotations. Crucially,
real-world datasets often exhibit human uncertainty (HU) -- variation in human
confidence across annotations -- but standard SFT simply optimizes toward the
most frequent label, disregarding HU distributions. This leaves two open
questions: How does HU affect SFT, and how can HU be effectively leveraged in
training? In this work, we first conduct a systematic evaluation of VLMs across
varying HU levels. We have two key findings: (i) surprisingly, high-HU samples
contribute little or even degrade model performance, and (ii) naively training
on the full dataset yields under-calibrated models that fail to capture HU
distributions. Motivated by these findings, we introduce HaDola, a human
uncertainty-aware data selection and automatic labeling framework. HaDola
operates in four stages -- discriminate, self-annotate, error trigger, and
training -- to iteratively identify harmful samples, prioritize informative
ones, and bootstrap from a small seed set (5\% of data). Our approach
substantially reduces reliance on costly HU annotations and makes VLMs more
accurate and better calibrated. Extensive experiments on VQAv2 and VizWiz
datasets demonstrate that HaDola consistently matches or outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines with less training data. Our work highlights the
importance of explicitly modeling HU in SFT, suggesting that better utilization
of HU is more effective than merely scaling up dataset size.

### [189] [$Δ\mathrm{Energy}$: Optimizing Energy Change During Vision-Language Alignment Improves both OOD Detection and OOD Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11296)
*Lin Zhu,Yifeng Yang,Xinbing Wang,Qinying Gu,Nanyang Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ΔEnergy, a novel OOD detection score that leverages energy changes during vision-language modality realignment, and EBM (Energy-based Bound Maximization) to simultaneously improve OOD generalization and detection in VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models encounter both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data in real-world applications, including covariate shifts (style changes) and semantic shifts (unseen classes). Current methods need better generalization to covariate-shifted OOD data while effectively detecting semantic-shifted OOD classes.

Method: Proposed ΔEnergy OOD score based on energy changes during vision-language modality realignment, and EBM framework that uses lower-bound maximization to improve both OOD detection and generalization by achieving domain-consistent Hessian.

Result: Extensive experiments show superiority over recent approaches, achieving 10% to 25% improvement in AUROC on challenging OOD detection and generalization benchmarks.

Conclusion: The unified fine-tuning framework with ΔEnergy and EBM effectively enhances VLMs' robustness for both OOD generalization and detection, providing a comprehensive solution for real-world deployment challenges.

Abstract: Recent approaches for vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable
success in achieving fast downstream adaptation. When applied to real-world
downstream tasks, VLMs inevitably encounter both the in-distribution (ID) data
and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. The OOD datasets often include both
covariate shifts (e.g., known classes with changes in image styles) and
semantic shifts (e.g., test-time unseen classes). This highlights the
importance of improving VLMs' generalization ability to covariate-shifted OOD
data, while effectively detecting open-set semantic-shifted OOD classes. In
this paper, inspired by the substantial energy change observed in closed-set
data when re-aligning vision-language modalities (specifically by directly
reducing the maximum cosine similarity to a low value), we introduce a novel
OOD score, named {\Delta}Energy. {\Delta}Energy significantly outperforms the
vanilla energy-based OOD score and provides a more reliable approach for OOD
detection. Furthermore, {\Delta}Energy can simultaneously improve OOD
generalization under covariate shifts, which is achieved by lower-bound
maximization for {\Delta}Energy (termed EBM). EBM is theoretically proven to
not only enhance OOD detection but also yields a domain-consistent Hessian,
which serves as a strong indicator for OOD generalization. Based on this
finding, we developed a unified fine-tuning framework that allows for improving
VLMs' robustness in both OOD generalization and OOD detection. Extensive
experiments on challenging OOD detection and generalization benchmarks
demonstrate the superiority of our method, outperforming recent approaches by
10% to 25% in AUROC.

TL;DR: Sketch2Symm is a two-stage method that generates geometrically consistent 3D shapes from sketches using semantic bridging (sketch-to-image translation) and symmetry constraints as geometric priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sketch-based 3D reconstruction is challenging due to the abstract and sparse nature of sketch inputs that lack sufficient semantic and geometric information.

Method: Two-stage generation method with semantic bridging via sketch-to-image translation to enrich sparse sketch representations, and incorporation of symmetry constraints as geometric priors to leverage structural regularity.

Result: Superior performance compared to existing sketch-based reconstruction methods on mainstream sketch datasets in terms of Chamfer Distance, Earth Mover's Distance, and F-Score.

Conclusion: The proposed semantic bridging and symmetry-aware design effectively address the challenges of sketch-based 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Sketch-based 3D reconstruction remains a challenging task due to the abstract
and sparse nature of sketch inputs, which often lack sufficient semantic and
geometric information. To address this, we propose Sketch2Symm, a two-stage
generation method that produces geometrically consistent 3D shapes from
sketches. Our approach introduces semantic bridging via sketch-to-image
translation to enrich sparse sketch representations, and incorporates symmetry
constraints as geometric priors to leverage the structural regularity commonly
found in everyday objects. Experiments on mainstream sketch datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing
sketch-based reconstruction methods in terms of Chamfer Distance, Earth Mover's
Distance, and F-Score, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed semantic
bridging and symmetry-aware design.

### [191] [Evaluating the effects of preprocessing, method selection, and hyperparameter tuning on SAR-based flood mapping and water depth estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11305)
*Jean-Paul Travert,Cédric Goeury,Sébastien Boyaval,Vito Bacchi,Fabrice Zaoui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study evaluates SAR imagery processing methods for flood mapping and water depth estimation, finding that method choices at each processing step significantly impact results and advocating for ensemble approaches to account for methodological uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how different preprocessing, flood mapping, and water depth estimation methods from SAR imagery affect flood analysis results, and to quantify the uncertainty introduced by method choices.

Method: Used SAR imagery to evaluate ensemble approaches including speckle noise reduction, flood mapping methods (supervised vs unsupervised), and water depth estimation techniques. Applied to two Garonne River flood events (2019, 2021) with hydrodynamic simulations and in-situ observations as reference.

Result: Speckle filter choice altered flood extent by several square kilometers. Supervised flood mapping outperformed unsupervised methods, but tuned unsupervised approaches achieved comparable results. Compounded uncertainty from preprocessing and mapping steps introduced high variability in water depth estimates.

Conclusion: The entire processing pipeline must be considered, with method choice being most influential for flood mapping and flood map inputs most critical for water depth estimation. Ensemble approaches should be adopted rather than single configurations to account for methodological uncertainty.

Abstract: Flood mapping and water depth estimation from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
imagery are crucial for calibrating and validating hydraulic models. This study
uses SAR imagery to evaluate various preprocessing (especially speckle noise
reduction), flood mapping, and water depth estimation methods. The impact of
the choice of method at different steps and its hyperparameters is studied by
considering an ensemble of preprocessed images, flood maps, and water depth
fields. The evaluation is conducted for two flood events on the Garonne River
(France) in 2019 and 2021, using hydrodynamic simulations and in-situ
observations as reference data. Results show that the choice of speckle filter
alters flood extent estimations with variations of several square kilometers.
Furthermore, the selection and tuning of flood mapping methods also affect
performance. While supervised methods outperformed unsupervised ones, tuned
unsupervised approaches (such as local thresholding or change detection) can
achieve comparable results. The compounded uncertainty from preprocessing and
flood mapping steps also introduces high variability in the water depth field
estimates. This study highlights the importance of considering the entire
processing pipeline, encompassing preprocessing, flood mapping, and water depth
estimation methods and their associated hyperparameters. Rather than relying on
a single configuration, adopting an ensemble approach and accounting for
methodological uncertainty should be privileged. For flood mapping, the method
choice has the most influence. For water depth estimation, the most influential
processing step was the flood map input resulting from the flood mapping step
and the hyperparameters of the methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces InternSVG, a unified multimodal large language model for SVG understanding, editing, and generation, along with SAgoge dataset and SArena benchmark, achieving superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in general SVG modeling including fragmented datasets, limited transferability across tasks, and difficulty handling structural complexity by leveraging MLLMs' transfer and generalization capabilities.

Method: Propose InternSVG with SVG-specific special tokens, subword-based embedding initialization, and two-stage training progressing from short static SVGs to long-sequence illustrations and complex animations. Built on SAgoge dataset and SArena benchmark.

Result: Experiments on SArena and prior benchmarks confirm substantial gains and consistent outperformance over leading open and proprietary counterparts.

Conclusion: The unified formulation induces positive transfer and improves overall performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of leveraging MLLMs for comprehensive SVG modeling tasks.

Abstract: General SVG modeling remains challenging due to fragmented datasets, limited
transferability of methods across tasks, and the difficulty of handling
structural complexity. In response, we leverage the strong transfer and
generalization capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to
achieve unified modeling for SVG understanding, editing, and generation. We
present the InternSVG family, an integrated data-benchmark-model suite. At its
core is SAgoge, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal dataset for SVG
tasks, encompassing both static graphics and dynamic animations. It covers
icons, long-sequence illustrations, scientific diagrams, and dynamic
animations, supporting tasks of varied difficulty levels and providing deeper
hierarchies with richer attributes compared to previous datasets. Based on this
resource, we introduce SArena, a companion benchmark with comprehensive task
definitions and standardized evaluation that aligns with the domains and
difficulty spectrum covered by SAgoge. Building on these foundations, we
propose InternSVG, a unified MLLM for SVG understanding, editing, and
generation with SVG-specific special tokens, subword-based embedding
initialization, and a two-stage training strategy that progresses from short
static SVGs to long-sequence illustrations and complex animations. This unified
formulation induces positive transfer and improves overall performance.
Experiments on SArena and prior benchmark confirm that InternSVG achieves
substantial gains and consistently outperforms leading open and proprietary

*Hai Dang Nguyen,Nguyen Dang Huy Pham,The Minh Duc Nguyen,Dac Thai Nguyen,Hang Thi Nguyen,Duong M. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMAP is a novel framework that uses multi-magnification patch representations and prototype embeddings to predict spatial gene expression from H&E-stained whole-slide images, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting spatial gene expression from histological images is challenging due to the modality gap between visual features and molecular signals, and existing methods have insufficient local feature granularity and inadequate global spatial context coverage.

Method: MMAP leverages multi-magnification patch representations to capture fine-grained histological details for local feature extraction, and learns latent prototype embeddings as compact representations of slide-level information for global contextual understanding.

Result: MMAP consistently outperforms all existing state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC).

Conclusion: The proposed MMAP framework effectively addresses both local feature granularity and global spatial context limitations in predicting spatial gene expression from histological images.

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) enables the measurement of gene expression while
preserving spatial information, offering critical insights into tissue
architecture and disease pathology. Recent developments have explored the use
of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) to predict
transcriptome-wide gene expression profiles through deep neural networks. This
task is commonly framed as a regression problem, where each input corresponds
to a localized image patch extracted from the WSI. However, predicting spatial
gene expression from histological images remains a challenging problem due to
the significant modality gap between visual features and molecular signals.
Recent studies have attempted to incorporate both local and global information
into predictive models. Nevertheless, existing methods still suffer from two
key limitations: (1) insufficient granularity in local feature extraction, and
(2) inadequate coverage of global spatial context. In this work, we propose a
novel framework, MMAP (Multi-MAgnification and Prototype-enhanced
architecture), that addresses both challenges simultaneously. To enhance local
feature granularity, MMAP leverages multi-magnification patch representations
that capture fine-grained histological details. To improve global contextual
understanding, it learns a set of latent prototype embeddings that serve as
compact representations of slide-level information. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that MMAP consistently outperforms all existing
state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics, including Mean
Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Pearson Correlation
Coefficient (PCC).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RALI uses contrastive learning to align images with generalizable text representations learned by RL, achieving comparable generalization to reasoning-based IQA models with 95% fewer parameters and inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning-based IQA models show great generalization but have high inference costs (energy and latency), limiting deployment. The mechanisms behind their generalization are not well understood.

Method: Proposed RALI algorithm that uses contrastive learning to directly align images with compact, cross-domain aligned text representations learned through RL training, eliminating the need for reasoning processes and LLMs.

Result: RALI achieves generalization performance comparable to reasoning-based IQA models while requiring less than 5% of model parameters and inference time.

Conclusion: The key to reasoning-based IQA generalization is the conversion of visual representations into compact text representations, which can be directly learned through contrastive alignment without expensive reasoning processes.

Abstract: Reasoning-based image quality assessment (IQA) models trained through
reinforcement learning (RL) exhibit exceptional generalization, yet the
underlying mechanisms and critical factors driving this capability remain
underexplored in current research. Moreover, despite their superior
performance, these models incur inference energy usage and latency orders of
magnitude higher than their earlier counterparts, restricting their deployment
in specific scenarios. Through extensive experiments, this paper verifies and
elaborates that through RL training, MLLMs leverage their reasoning capability
to convert redundant visual representations into compact, cross-domain aligned
text representations. This conversion is precisely the source of the
generalization exhibited by these reasoning-based IQA models. Building on this
fundamental insight, we propose a novel algorithm, RALI, which employs
contrastive learning to directly align images with these generalizable text
representations learned by RL. This approach eliminates the reliance on
reasoning processes and even obviates the need to load an LLM. For the quality
scoring task, this framework achieves generalization performance comparable to
reasoning-based models while requiring less than 5% of their model parameters
and inference time.

*Wenyuan Zhang,Jimin Tang,Weiqi Zhang,Yi Fang,Yu-Shen Liu,Zhizhong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to improve reflection modeling in Gaussian Splatting by enforcing multi-view consistent material inference and introducing physically-based environment modeling with ray tracing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches using Gaussian primitives for reflection modeling suffer from insufficient constraints in material inference, leading to illumination aliasing and reduced generalization, especially under limited environment modeling.

Method: The method enforces 2D Gaussians to produce multi-view consistent material maps during deferred shading, tracks photometric variations across views to identify reflective regions as priors, and introduces environment modeling through ray tracing with 2DGS to handle indirect illumination from inter-object occlusions.

Result: Experiments on widely used benchmarks show the method faithfully recovers both illumination and geometry, achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality in novel view synthesis.

Conclusion: Multi-view consistent material inference with physically-based environment modeling is key to learning accurate reflections with Gaussian Splatting, enabling photorealistic rendering of indirect radiance.

Abstract: Modeling reflections from 2D images is essential for photorealistic rendering
and novel view synthesis. Recent approaches enhance Gaussian primitives with
reflection-related material attributes to enable physically based rendering
(PBR) with Gaussian Splatting. However, the material inference often lacks
sufficient constraints, especially under limited environment modeling,
resulting in illumination aliasing and reduced generalization. In this work, we
revisit the problem from a multi-view perspective and show that multi-view
consistent material inference with more physically-based environment modeling
is key to learning accurate reflections with Gaussian Splatting. To this end,
we enforce 2D Gaussians to produce multi-view consistent material maps during
deferred shading. We also track photometric variations across views to identify
highly reflective regions, which serve as strong priors for reflection strength
terms. To handle indirect illumination caused by inter-object occlusions, we
further introduce an environment modeling strategy through ray tracing with
2DGS, enabling photorealistic rendering of indirect radiance. Experiments on
widely used benchmarks show that our method faithfully recovers both
illumination and geometry, achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality in
novel views synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Establishing object-level correspondence between egocentric and exocentric views is essential for intelligent assistants but faces challenges like extreme viewpoint variations, occlusions, and small objects. Existing approaches and SAM 2 struggle with ineffective feature fusion and limited long-term memory capacity.

Method: Proposes LM-EEC framework with: (i) Memory-View MoE module using dual-branch routing to adaptively assign weights to expert features along channel and spatial dimensions, and (ii) dual-memory bank system with compression strategy to retain critical long-term information while eliminating redundancy.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art results on EgoExo4D benchmark, significantly outperforming existing methods and SAM 2 baseline, with strong generalization across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed LM-EEC framework effectively addresses the limitations of SAM 2 for ego-exo correspondence tasks through innovative memory architecture and adaptive feature routing, demonstrating superior performance in challenging real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Establishing object-level correspondence between egocentric and exocentric
views is essential for intelligent assistants to deliver precise and intuitive
visual guidance. However, this task faces numerous challenges, including
extreme viewpoint variations, occlusions, and the presence of small objects.
Existing approaches usually borrow solutions from video object segmentation
models, but still suffer from the aforementioned challenges. Recently, the
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has shown strong generalization capabilities
and excellent performance in video object segmentation. Yet, when simply
applied to the ego-exo correspondence (EEC) task, SAM 2 encounters severe
difficulties due to ineffective ego-exo feature fusion and limited long-term
memory capacity, especially for long videos. Addressing these problems, we
propose a novel EEC framework based on SAM 2 with long-term memories by
presenting a dual-memory architecture and an adaptive feature routing module
inspired by Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Compared to SAM 2, our approach features
(i) a Memory-View MoE module which consists of a dual-branch routing mechanism
to adaptively assign contribution weights to each expert feature along both
channel and spatial dimensions, and (ii) a dual-memory bank system with a
simple yet effective compression strategy to retain critical long-term
information while eliminating redundancy. In the extensive experiments on the
challenging EgoExo4D benchmark, our method, dubbed LM-EEC, achieves new
state-of-the-art results and significantly outperforms existing methods and the
SAM 2 baseline, showcasing its strong generalization across diverse scenarios.

TL;DR: A novel framework fusing satellite imagery with AIS data for inland waterway monitoring, using YOLO v11 to detect vessels and identify dark vessels with high accuracy across multiple classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of AIS-based monitoring in inland waterways by leveraging non-cooperative satellite imagery to identify dark vessels, validate cooperative traffic, and support advanced Maritime Domain Awareness.

Method: Fusion of high-resolution satellite imagery with AIS trajectory data using YOLO v11 object detection model for vessel detection and characterization (type, barge cover, operational status, direction, count). Developed annotated dataset from 5,973 mi² of Lower Mississippi River imagery.

Result: High performance across tasks: vessel classification F1=95.8%, barge cover detection F1=91.6%, operational status F1=99.4%, directionality accuracy=93.8%, barge count MAE=2.4. Spatial transferability maintained up to 98% accuracy across disjoint river segments.

Conclusion: Integration of non-cooperative satellite sensing with AIS fusion is viable for near-real-time fleet inventories, anomaly detection, and high-quality inland waterway surveillance. Future work will expand datasets and incorporate temporal tracking.

Abstract: Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) for inland waterways remains challenged by
cooperative system vulnerabilities. This paper presents a novel framework that
fuses high-resolution satellite imagery with vessel trajectory data from the
Automatic Identification System (AIS). This work addresses the limitations of
AIS-based monitoring by leveraging non-cooperative satellite imagery and
implementing a fusion approach that links visual detections with AIS data to
identify dark vessels, validate cooperative traffic, and support advanced MDA.
The You Only Look Once (YOLO) v11 object detection model is used to detect and
characterize vessels and barges by vessel type, barge cover, operational
status, barge count, and direction of travel. An annotated data set of 4,550
instances was developed from $5{,}973~\mathrm{mi}^2$ of Lower Mississippi River
imagery. Evaluation on a held-out test set demonstrated vessel classification
(tugboat, crane barge, bulk carrier, cargo ship, and hopper barge) with an F1
score of 95.8\%; barge cover (covered or uncovered) detection yielded an F1
score of 91.6\%; operational status (staged or in motion) classification
reached an F1 score of 99.4\%. Directionality (upstream, downstream) yielded
93.8\% accuracy. The barge count estimation resulted in a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 2.4 barges. Spatial transferability analysis across geographically
disjoint river segments showed accuracy was maintained as high as 98\%. These
results underscore the viability of integrating non-cooperative satellite
sensing with AIS fusion. This approach enables near-real-time fleet
inventories, supports anomaly detection, and generates high-quality data for
inland waterway surveillance. Future work will expand annotated datasets,
incorporate temporal tracking, and explore multi-modal deep learning to further
enhance operational scalability.

TL;DR: VGDCFusion is a novel infrared and visible image fusion method that tightly couples degradation modeling with fusion, using vision-language models for degradation-aware perception and guided suppression to handle degraded images effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IVIF methods assume high-quality inputs and rely on manual pre-processing for degraded images, leading to performance degradation due to decoupled degradation handling and fusion processes.

Method: Proposes VGDCFusion with two key components: Specific-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Extractor (SPDCE) for modality-specific degradation awareness and joint modeling, and Joint-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Fusion (JPDCF) for cross-modal degradation perception and residual degradation filtering.

Result: Extensive experiments show VGDCFusion significantly outperforms state-of-the-art fusion approaches under various degraded image scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully couples degradation modeling with fusion process and leverages VLMs for effective degradation-aware perception, achieving superior performance on degraded infrared and visible image fusion tasks.

Abstract: Existing Infrared and Visible Image Fusion (IVIF) methods typically assume
high-quality inputs. However, when handing degraded images, these methods
heavily rely on manually switching between different pre-processing techniques.
This decoupling of degradation handling and image fusion leads to significant
performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel VLM-Guided
Degradation-Coupled Fusion network (VGDCFusion), which tightly couples
degradation modeling with the fusion process and leverages vision-language
models (VLMs) for degradation-aware perception and guided suppression.
Specifically, the proposed Specific-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Extractor
(SPDCE) enables modality-specific degradation awareness and establishes a joint
modeling of degradation suppression and intra-modal feature extraction. In
parallel, the Joint-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Fusion (JPDCF) facilitates
cross-modal degradation perception and couples residual degradation filtering
with complementary cross-modal feature fusion. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our VGDCFusion significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art fusion approaches under various degraded image scenarios. Our

<details>

Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting is efficient for novel view synthesis but struggles with accurate surface reconstruction due to its discrete and unstructured nature, leading to inaccurate geometry and inconsistent multi-view alignment when supervised only by image rendering loss.

Method: The method introduces view alignment (VA) with four key components: 1) edge-aware image cues in rendering loss for better surface boundaries, 2) visibility-aware photometric alignment loss to handle occlusions and spatial relationships, 3) normal-based constraints to refine spatial orientation and local surfaces, and 4) deep image feature embeddings for cross-view consistency under varying conditions.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show the method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

Conclusion: The proposed view alignment approach significantly improves the geometric representation of 3D Gaussian Splatting, addressing its limitations in surface reconstruction while maintaining its efficiency for novel view synthesis.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently emerged as an efficient solution for
high-quality and real-time novel view synthesis. However, its capability for
accurate surface reconstruction remains underexplored. Due to the discrete and
unstructured nature of Gaussians, supervision based solely on image rendering
loss often leads to inaccurate geometry and inconsistent multi-view alignment.
In this work, we propose a novel method that enhances the geometric
representation of 3D Gaussians through view alignment (VA). Specifically, we
incorporate edge-aware image cues into the rendering loss to improve surface
boundary delineation. To enforce geometric consistency across views, we
introduce a visibility-aware photometric alignment loss that models occlusions
and encourages accurate spatial relationships among Gaussians. To further
mitigate ambiguities caused by lighting variations, we incorporate normal-based
constraints to refine the spatial orientation of Gaussians and improve local
surface estimation. Additionally, we leverage deep image feature embeddings to
enforce cross-view consistency, enhancing the robustness of the learned
geometry under varying viewpoints and illumination. Extensive experiments on
standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis. The source

### [200] [Towards Fast and Scalable Normal Integration using Continuous Components](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11508)
*Francesco Milano,Jen Jen Chung,Lionel Ott,Roland Siegwart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel normal integration method that reduces optimization variables by grouping pixels into continuous components and estimating relative scales, achieving state-of-the-art results with significant speed improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing normal integration approaches require iterative global optimization for each pixel, which scales poorly to larger normal maps and becomes computationally expensive.

Method: Recasts normal integration as estimating relative scales of continuous components, uses heuristic for accurate component estimation, rebalances optimization terms, and iteratively merges components to reduce problem size.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks in seconds, with one-order-of-magnitude speedup over pixel-level approaches on large-resolution normal maps.

Conclusion: The proposed component-based approach provides an efficient and scalable solution to normal integration, significantly outperforming traditional pixel-level methods in both speed and accuracy.

Abstract: Surface normal integration is a fundamental problem in computer vision,
dealing with the objective of reconstructing a surface from its corresponding
normal map. Existing approaches require an iterative global optimization to
jointly estimate the depth of each pixel, which scales poorly to larger normal
maps. In this paper, we address this problem by recasting normal integration as
the estimation of relative scales of continuous components. By constraining
pixels belonging to the same component to jointly vary their scale, we
drastically reduce the number of optimization variables. Our framework includes
a heuristic to accurately estimate continuous components from the start, a
strategy to rebalance optimization terms, and a technique to iteratively merge
components to further reduce the size of the problem. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art results on the standard normal integration benchmark in as
little as a few seconds and achieves one-order-of-magnitude speedup over
pixel-level approaches on large-resolution normal maps.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Situat3DChange is a comprehensive 3D dataset for situation-aware change understanding with 121K QA pairs, 36K change descriptions, and 17K rearrangement instructions, addressing limitations in current dynamic scene understanding benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D datasets focus on either dynamic scenarios or dynamic situations in isolation, leading to incomplete comprehension of environmental changes. There's a need for comprehensive datasets that support situation-aware change understanding for human-AI collaboration.

Method: The dataset leverages 11K human observations enriched with egocentric/allocentric perspectives and spatial relations, integrated using LLMs. Also proposed SCReasoner, an efficient 3D MLLM approach for point cloud comparison with minimal parameter overhead.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation shows progress and limitations of MLLMs in dynamic scene understanding. Additional experiments demonstrate the task-agnostic effectiveness of using Situat3DChange as training data for MLLMs, with successful cross-domain transfer.

Conclusion: Situat3DChange provides a valuable benchmark for advancing 3D scene understanding in dynamic environments, supporting shared mental models for human-AI collaboration and enabling efficient change detection through the proposed SCReasoner approach.

Abstract: Physical environments and circumstances are fundamentally dynamic, yet
current 3D datasets and evaluation benchmarks tend to concentrate on either
dynamic scenarios or dynamic situations in isolation, resulting in incomplete
comprehension. To overcome these constraints, we introduce Situat3DChange, an
extensive dataset supporting three situation-aware change understanding tasks
following the perception-action model: 121K question-answer pairs, 36K change
descriptions for perception tasks, and 17K rearrangement instructions for the
action task. To construct this large-scale dataset, Situat3DChange leverages
11K human observations of environmental changes to establish shared mental
models and shared situational awareness for human-AI collaboration. These
observations, enriched with egocentric and allocentric perspectives as well as
categorical and coordinate spatial relations, are integrated using an LLM to
support understanding of situated changes. To address the challenge of
comparing pairs of point clouds from the same scene with minor changes, we
propose SCReasoner, an efficient 3D MLLM approach that enables effective point
cloud comparison with minimal parameter overhead and no additional tokens
required for the language decoder. Comprehensive evaluation on Situat3DChange
tasks highlights both the progress and limitations of MLLMs in dynamic scene
and situation understanding. Additional experiments on data scaling and
cross-domain transfer demonstrate the task-agnostic effectiveness of using
Situat3DChange as a training dataset for MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: mmWalk is a multi-modal dataset for outdoor navigation assistance for blind/low vision users, featuring 120 walking trajectories with synchronized sensor data and accessibility features, plus a VQA benchmark showing current VLMs struggle with risk assessment tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of walking assistance in extreme/complex environments for BLV users by providing holistic scene understanding through multi-modal data integration.

Method: Created mmWalk dataset with 120 manually controlled walking trajectories (62k synchronized frames) containing RGB, depth, and semantic modalities, plus mmWalkVQA benchmark with 69k visual question-answer triplets across 9 categories.

Result: State-of-the-art VLMs struggle with risk assessment and navigational tasks in zero- and few-shot settings. The mmWalk-finetuned model shows effectiveness when validated on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The mmWalk dataset advances multi-modal walking assistance by providing comprehensive accessibility-oriented data that addresses real-world BLV navigation challenges.

Abstract: Walking assistance in extreme or complex environments remains a significant
challenge for people with blindness or low vision (BLV), largely due to the
lack of a holistic scene understanding. Motivated by the real-world needs of
the BLV community, we build mmWalk, a simulated multi-modal dataset that
integrates multi-view sensor and accessibility-oriented features for outdoor
safe navigation. Our dataset comprises 120 manually controlled,
scenario-categorized walking trajectories with 62k synchronized frames. It
contains over 559k panoramic images across RGB, depth, and semantic modalities.
Furthermore, to emphasize real-world relevance, each trajectory involves
outdoor corner cases and accessibility-specific landmarks for BLV users.
Additionally, we generate mmWalkVQA, a VQA benchmark with over 69k visual
question-answer triplets across 9 categories tailored for safe and informed
walking assistance. We evaluate state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
using zero- and few-shot settings and found they struggle with our risk
assessment and navigational tasks. We validate our mmWalk-finetuned model on
real-world datasets and show the effectiveness of our dataset for advancing
multi-modal walking assistance.

*Chaofan Gan,Zicheng Zhao,Yuanpeng Tu,Xi Chen,Ziran Qin,Tieyuan Chen,Mehrtash Harandi,Weiyao Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates Massive Activations (MAs) in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) and proposes Detail Guidance (DG), a training-free method to enhance local detail synthesis by leveraging these activations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent observations reveal Massive Activations (MAs) in DiTs' internal feature maps, but their function remains poorly understood. The authors aim to systematically investigate these activations and their role in visual generation.

Method: The authors propose Detail Guidance (DG), a MAs-driven training-free self-guidance strategy. DG constructs a degraded 'detail-deficient' model by disrupting MAs and uses it to guide the original network toward higher-quality detail synthesis. DG can integrate with Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG).

Result: Extensive experiments show that DG consistently improves fine-grained detail quality across various pre-trained DiTs (SD3, SD3.5, and Flux). The method enhances local detail fidelity without impacting overall semantic content.

Conclusion: Massive Activations in DiTs play a key role in local detail synthesis. The proposed Detail Guidance effectively leverages these activations to improve detail quality in visual generation, working complementarily with existing guidance methods like CFG.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently emerged as a powerful backbone
for visual generation. Recent observations reveal \emph{Massive Activations}
(MAs) in their internal feature maps, yet their function remains poorly
understood. In this work, we systematically investigate these activations to
elucidate their role in visual generation. We found that these massive
activations occur across all spatial tokens, and their distribution is
modulated by the input timestep embeddings. Importantly, our investigations
further demonstrate that these massive activations play a key role in local
detail synthesis, while having minimal impact on the overall semantic content
of output. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{D}etail
\textbf{G}uidance (\textbf{DG}), a MAs-driven, training-free self-guidance
strategy to explicitly enhance local detail fidelity for DiTs. Specifically, DG
constructs a degraded ``detail-deficient'' model by disrupting MAs and
leverages it to guide the original network toward higher-quality detail
synthesis. Our DG can seamlessly integrate with Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG),
enabling further refinements of fine-grained details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our DG consistently improves fine-grained detail quality
across various pre-trained DiTs (\eg, SD3, SD3.5, and Flux).

### [204] [ODI-Bench: Can MLLMs Understand Immersive Omnidirectional Environments?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11549)
*Liu Yang,Huiyu Duan,Ran Tao,Juntao Cheng,Sijing Wu,Yunhao Li,Jing Liu,Xiongkuo Min,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ODI-Bench is a comprehensive benchmark for omnidirectional image understanding with 2,000 images and 4,000 QA pairs across 10 tasks, revealing that current MLLMs struggle with ODI comprehension. Omni-CoT is proposed as a training-free enhancement method using chain-of-thought reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs perform well on 2D images but their ability to understand immersive omnidirectional images (ODIs) used in VR/AR applications remains unexplored, creating a gap in evaluating and improving ODI comprehension.

Method: Created ODI-Bench with 2,000 ODIs and 4,000 QA pairs across 10 tasks, benchmarked 20 MLLMs, and introduced Omni-CoT - a training-free chain-of-thought reasoning method that integrates textual and visual cues.

Result: Experiments show current MLLMs struggle to capture immersive ODI context. Omni-CoT significantly enhances MLLMs' ODI comprehension ability without requiring additional training.

Conclusion: The work establishes ODI-Bench as the first comprehensive benchmark for ODI understanding and demonstrates that Omni-CoT effectively improves MLLM performance on omnidirectional image comprehension tasks.

Abstract: Omnidirectional images (ODIs) provide full 360x180 view which are widely
adopted in VR, AR and embodied intelligence applications. While multi-modal
large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
conventional 2D image and video understanding benchmarks, their ability to
comprehend the immersive environments captured by ODIs remains largely
unexplored. To address this gap, we first present ODI-Bench, a novel
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for omnidirectional image
understanding. ODI-Bench contains 2,000 high-quality omnidirectional images and
over 4,000 manually annotated question-answering (QA) pairs across 10
fine-grained tasks, covering both general-level and spatial-level ODI
understanding. Extensive experiments are conducted to benchmark 20
representative MLLMs, including proprietary and open-source models, under both
close-ended and open-ended settings. Experimental results reveal that current
MLLMs still struggle to capture the immersive context provided by ODIs. To this
end, we further introduce Omni-CoT, a training-free method which significantly
enhances MLLMs' comprehension ability in the omnidirectional environment
through chain-of-thought reasoning across both textual information and visual
cues. Both the benchmark and the code will be released upon the publication.

*Nikolay Nechaev,Evgenia Przhezdzetskaya,Viktor Gombolevskiy,Dmitry Umerenkov,Dmitry Dylov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foundation models like XrayCLIP and XraySigLIP achieve strong chest X-ray classification performance with significantly fewer labeled examples than traditional ResNet-50, and learning curves from just 50 labeled cases can accurately predict final performance plateaus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chest X-ray classification is resource-intensive and typically requires extensive annotated data. While foundation models reduce this dependency, it's unclear how many labeled samples are actually needed for specific performance levels.

Method: Systematically evaluate power-law fits to predict required training size for specific ROC-AUC thresholds, testing multiple pathologies and foundation models including XrayCLIP, XraySigLIP, and ResNet-50 baseline.

Result: XrayCLIP and XraySigLIP achieve strong performance with significantly fewer labeled examples than ResNet-50. Learning curve slopes from just 50 labeled cases accurately forecast final performance plateaus.

Conclusion: Practitioners can minimize annotation costs by labeling only the essential samples needed for targeted performance levels, using the predictive power of early learning curves.

Abstract: Chest X-ray classification is vital yet resource-intensive, typically
demanding extensive annotated data for accurate diagnosis. Foundation models
mitigate this reliance, but how many labeled samples are required remains
unclear. We systematically evaluate the use of power-law fits to predict the
training size necessary for specific ROC-AUC thresholds. Testing multiple
pathologies and foundation models, we find XrayCLIP and XraySigLIP achieve
strong performance with significantly fewer labeled examples than a ResNet-50
baseline. Importantly, learning curve slopes from just 50 labeled cases
accurately forecast final performance plateaus. Our results enable

*Aniket Gupta,Hanhui Wang,Charles Saunders,Aruni RoyChowdhury,Hanumant Singh,Huaizu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SNAP is a unified 3D point cloud segmentation model that supports both point-based and text-based prompts across diverse domains (indoor, outdoor, aerial), achieving state-of-the-art performance through domain-adaptive normalization and automatic mask proposal generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current interactive 3D segmentation methods are limited to single domains and single interaction types, with multi-dataset training often causing negative transfer and poor generalizability.

Method: Train on 7 diverse datasets using domain-adaptive normalization to prevent negative transfer. For text prompts, automatically generate mask proposals and match them against CLIP embeddings of textual queries.

Result: Achieves SOTA on 8/9 zero-shot benchmarks for spatial-prompted segmentation and competitive results on all 5 text-prompted benchmarks, outperforming specialized domain-specific approaches.

Conclusion: A unified model can match or exceed specialized domain-specific tools, providing a practical solution for scalable 3D annotation across diverse environments.

Abstract: Interactive 3D point cloud segmentation enables efficient annotation of
complex 3D scenes through user-guided prompts. However, current approaches are
typically restricted in scope to a single domain (indoor or outdoor), and to a
single form of user interaction (either spatial clicks or textual prompts).
Moreover, training on multiple datasets often leads to negative transfer,
resulting in domain-specific tools that lack generalizability. To address these
limitations, we present \textbf{SNAP} (\textbf{S}egment a\textbf{N}ything in
\textbf{A}ny \textbf{P}oint cloud), a unified model for interactive 3D
segmentation that supports both point-based and text-based prompts across
diverse domains. Our approach achieves cross-domain generalizability by
training on 7 datasets spanning indoor, outdoor, and aerial environments, while
employing domain-adaptive normalization to prevent negative transfer. For
text-prompted segmentation, we automatically generate mask proposals without
human intervention and match them against CLIP embeddings of textual queries,
enabling both panoptic and open-vocabulary segmentation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SNAP consistently delivers high-quality segmentation results.
We achieve state-of-the-art performance on 8 out of 9 zero-shot benchmarks for
spatial-prompted segmentation and demonstrate competitive results on all 5
text-prompted benchmarks. These results show that a unified model can match or
exceed specialized domain-specific approaches, providing a practical tool for
scalable 3D annotation. Project page is at, https://neu-vi.github.io/SNAP/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework that adapts diffusion models to generate high-fidelity, target-aligned images from synthetic semantic maps using imperfect pseudo-labels, transforming weak synthetic data into competitive real-domain training sets for urban scene recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic datasets for urban scene recognition show noticeable gaps to real imagery, especially when adapting to specific target domains like Cityscapes. Closing this gap with detailed 3D modeling would be expensive and defeat the purpose of low-cost labeled data.

Method: Adapts an off-the-shelf diffusion model to a target domain using only imperfect pseudo-labels. The method filters suboptimal generations, rectifies image-label misalignments, and standardizes semantics across datasets.

Result: Experiments on five synthetic datasets and two real target datasets show segmentation gains of up to +8.0%pt. mIoU over state-of-the-art translation methods, making rapidly constructed synthetic datasets as effective as high-effort synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: The work presents a collaborative paradigm where fast semantic prototyping combined with generative models enables scalable, high-quality training data creation for urban scene understanding.

Abstract: Synthetic datasets are widely used for training urban scene recognition
models, but even highly realistic renderings show a noticeable gap to real
imagery. This gap is particularly pronounced when adapting to a specific target
domain, such as Cityscapes, where differences in architecture, vegetation,
object appearance, and camera characteristics limit downstream performance.
Closing this gap with more detailed 3D modelling would require expensive asset
and scene design, defeating the purpose of low-cost labelled data. To address
this, we present a new framework that adapts an off-the-shelf diffusion model
to a target domain using only imperfect pseudo-labels. Once trained, it
generates high-fidelity, target-aligned images from semantic maps of any
synthetic dataset, including low-effort sources created in hours rather than
months. The method filters suboptimal generations, rectifies image-label
misalignments, and standardises semantics across datasets, transforming weak
synthetic data into competitive real-domain training sets. Experiments on five
synthetic datasets and two real target datasets show segmentation gains of up
to +8.0%pt. mIoU over state-of-the-art translation methods, making rapidly
constructed synthetic datasets as effective as high-effort, time-intensive
synthetic datasets requiring extensive manual design. This work highlights a
valuable collaborative paradigm where fast semantic prototyping, combined with
generative models, enables scalable, high-quality training data creation for
urban scene understanding.

*Hongyu Zhu,Lin Chen,Mounim A. El-Yacoubi,Mingsheng Shang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MS-Mix is an emotion-sensitive multimodal augmentation framework that addresses label ambiguity in sentiment analysis by adaptively mixing samples based on sentiment compatibility and intensity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Mixup-based augmentation methods struggle with multimodal sentiment analysis due to random mixing causing label ambiguity and semantic inconsistency when samples with contradictory emotions are combined.

Method: MS-Mix uses three key components: Sentiment-Aware Sample Selection to prevent mixing contradictory emotions, Sentiment Intensity Guided module for dynamic modality-specific mixing ratios, and Sentiment Alignment Loss with KL divergence for joint training.

Result: Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets with six state-of-the-art backbones show MS-Mix consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing new standards for robust multimodal sentiment augmentation.

Conclusion: MS-Mix effectively addresses the challenges of multimodal sentiment augmentation through emotion-aware mixing mechanisms and achieves superior performance across various datasets and backbone models.

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) aims to identify and interpret human
emotions by integrating information from heterogeneous data sources such as
text, video, and audio. While deep learning models have advanced in network
architecture design, they remain heavily limited by scarce multimodal annotated
data. Although Mixup-based augmentation improves generalization in unimodal
tasks, its direct application to MSA introduces critical challenges: random
mixing often amplifies label ambiguity and semantic inconsistency due to the
lack of emotion-aware mixing mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose
MS-Mix, an adaptive, emotion-sensitive augmentation framework that
automatically optimizes sample mixing in multimodal settings. The key
components of MS-Mix include: (1) a Sentiment-Aware Sample Selection (SASS)
strategy that effectively prevents semantic confusion caused by mixing samples
with contradictory emotions. (2) a Sentiment Intensity Guided (SIG) module
using multi-head self-attention to compute modality-specific mixing ratios
dynamically based on their respective emotional intensities. (3) a Sentiment
Alignment Loss (SAL) that aligns the prediction distributions across
modalities, and incorporates the Kullback-Leibler-based loss as an additional
regularization term to train the emotion intensity predictor and the backbone
network jointly. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets with six
state-of-the-art backbones confirm that MS-Mix consistently outperforms
existing methods, establishing a new standard for robust multimodal sentiment
augmentation. The source code is available at:

*Leonard Bruns,Axel Barroso-Laguna,Tommaso Cavallari,Áron Monszpart,Sowmya Munukutla,Victor Adrian Prisacariu,Eric Brachmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ACE-G separates coordinate regression from map representation using a generic transformer and scene-specific map code, enabling pre-training on thousands of scenes and improved generalization to unseen query images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional scene coordinate regression (SCR) methods overfit to training views by design, limiting their generalization to query images with different imaging conditions like lighting or viewpoint.

Method: Proposes ACE-G framework that decouples coordinate regressor and map representation into a generic transformer and scene-specific map code, allowing pre-training on thousands of scenes and training for generalization.

Result: Demonstrates significantly increased robustness on multiple challenging relocalization datasets while maintaining attractive computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The separation of coordinate regressor and map representation enables effective pre-training and generalization, overcoming inherent limitations of previous SCR frameworks.

Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) has established itself as a promising
learning-based approach to visual relocalization. After mere minutes of
scene-specific training, SCR models estimate camera poses of query images with
high accuracy. Still, SCR methods fall short of the generalization capabilities
of more classical feature-matching approaches. When imaging conditions of query
images, such as lighting or viewpoint, are too different from the training
views, SCR models fail. Failing to generalize is an inherent limitation of
previous SCR frameworks, since their training objective is to encode the
training views in the weights of the coordinate regressor itself. The regressor
essentially overfits to the training views, by design. We propose to separate
the coordinate regressor and the map representation into a generic transformer
and a scene-specific map code. This separation allows us to pre-train the
transformer on tens of thousands of scenes. More importantly, it allows us to
train the transformer to generalize from mapping images to unseen query images
during pre-training. We demonstrate on multiple challenging relocalization
datasets that our method, ACE-G, leads to significantly increased robustness
while keeping the computational footprint attractive.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks neglect the fine-grained and long-horizon nature of authentic laboratory work, especially in wet-lab settings, making it difficult to understand MLLMs' true capabilities for accelerating scientific discovery.

Method: Created ExpVid benchmark curated from peer-reviewed video publications with a three-level task hierarchy: Fine-grained Perception, Procedural Understanding, and Scientific Reasoning. Used vision-centric annotation pipeline combining automated generation with multi-disciplinary expert validation.

Result: Evaluated 19 leading MLLMs and found they excel at coarse-grained recognition but struggle with fine details, state tracking over time, and linking procedures to outcomes. Notable performance gap between proprietary and open-source models, especially in high-order reasoning.

Conclusion: ExpVid provides a diagnostic tool and roadmap for developing MLLMs capable of becoming trustworthy partners in scientific experimentation, highlighting current limitations that need to be addressed.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold promise for accelerating
scientific discovery by interpreting complex experimental procedures. However,
their true capabilities are poorly understood, as existing benchmarks neglect
the fine-grained and long-horizon nature of authentic laboratory work,
especially in wet-lab settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce ExpVid, the
first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs on scientific
experiment videos. Curated from peer-reviewed video publications, ExpVid
features a new three-level task hierarchy that mirrors the scientific process:
(1) Fine-grained Perception of tools, materials, and actions; (2) Procedural
Understanding of step order and completeness; and (3) Scientific Reasoning that
connects the full experiment to its published conclusions. Our vision-centric
annotation pipeline, combining automated generation with multi-disciplinary
expert validation, ensures that tasks require visual grounding. We evaluate 19
leading MLLMs on ExpVid and find that while they excel at coarse-grained
recognition, they struggle with disambiguating fine details, tracking state
changes over time, and linking experimental procedures to scientific outcomes.
Our results reveal a notable performance gap between proprietary and
open-source models, particularly in high-order reasoning. ExpVid not only
provides a diagnostic tool but also charts a roadmap for developing MLLMs
capable of becoming trustworthy partners in scientific experimentation.

TL;DR: LLF-LUT++ is a pyramid network that combines global and local operators for photo enhancement, achieving both high performance and computational efficiency. It processes 4K images in 13ms with 2.64dB PSNR improvement on HDR+ dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing photo enhancement methods either focus on performance (creating large models unsuitable for edge devices) or computational efficiency (resulting in inadequate performance for real-world applications). There's a need for a method that balances both aspects.

Method: Uses pyramid network with closed-form Laplacian pyramid decomposition and reconstruction. Integrates image-adaptive 3D LUT for global tonal enhancement with spatial-frequency transformer weight predictor, and applies local Laplacian filters for edge detail refinement in high-frequency components.

Result: Achieves 2.64 dB PSNR improvement on HDR+ dataset, processes 4K resolution images in 13ms on single GPU, and performs favorably compared to state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: LLF-LUT++ successfully balances enhancement performance and computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-world applications while maintaining high-quality results.

Abstract: Photo enhancement plays a crucial role in augmenting the visual aesthetics of
a photograph. In recent years, photo enhancement methods have either focused on
enhancement performance, producing powerful models that cannot be deployed on
edge devices, or prioritized computational efficiency, resulting in inadequate
performance for real-world applications. To this end, this paper introduces a
pyramid network called LLF-LUT++, which integrates global and local operators
through closed-form Laplacian pyramid decomposition and reconstruction. This
approach enables fast processing of high-resolution images while also achieving
excellent performance. Specifically, we utilize an image-adaptive 3D LUT that
capitalizes on the global tonal characteristics of downsampled images, while
incorporating two distinct weight fusion strategies to achieve coarse global
image enhancement. To implement this strategy, we designed a spatial-frequency
transformer weight predictor that effectively extracts the desired distinct
weights by leveraging frequency features. Additionally, we apply local
Laplacian filters to adaptively refine edge details in high-frequency
components. After meticulously redesigning the network structure and
transformer model, LLF-LUT++ not only achieves a 2.64 dB improvement in PSNR on
the HDR+ dataset, but also further reduces runtime, with 4K resolution images
processed in just 13 ms on a single GPU. Extensive experimental results on two
benchmark datasets further show that the proposed approach performs favorably
compared to state-of-the-art methods. The source code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/fengzhang427/LLF-LUT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video editing benchmarks fail to adequately support instruction-guided video editing evaluation, suffering from limited source diversity, narrow task coverage, and incomplete evaluation metrics.

Method: IVEBench includes 600 high-quality source videos across 7 semantic dimensions, covers 8 categories of editing tasks with 35 subcategories using LLM-generated prompts, and establishes a three-dimensional evaluation protocol (video quality, instruction compliance, video fidelity) with both traditional metrics and multimodal LLM-based assessments.

Conclusion: IVEBench successfully addresses the limitations of existing benchmarks and provides a comprehensive evaluation framework for instruction-guided video editing methods.

Abstract: Instruction-guided video editing has emerged as a rapidly advancing research
direction, offering new opportunities for intuitive content transformation
while also posing significant challenges for systematic evaluation. Existing
video editing benchmarks fail to support the evaluation of instruction-guided
video editing adequately and further suffer from limited source diversity,
narrow task coverage and incomplete evaluation metrics. To address the above
limitations, we introduce IVEBench, a modern benchmark suite specifically
designed for instruction-guided video editing assessment. IVEBench comprises a
diverse database of 600 high-quality source videos, spanning seven semantic
dimensions, and covering video lengths ranging from 32 to 1,024 frames. It
further includes 8 categories of editing tasks with 35 subcategories, whose
prompts are generated and refined through large language models and expert
review. Crucially, IVEBench establishes a three-dimensional evaluation protocol
encompassing video quality, instruction compliance and video fidelity,
integrating both traditional metrics and multimodal large language model-based
assessments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IVEBench in
benchmarking state-of-the-art instruction-guided video editing methods, showing
its ability to provide comprehensive and human-aligned evaluation outcomes.

*Pradyumna Yalandur Muralidhar,Yuxuan Xue,Xianghui Xie,Margaret Kostyrko,Gerard Pons-Moll*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhySIC reconstructs metrically accurate 3D humans and scenes from single RGB images by addressing depth ambiguity, occlusions, and physical inconsistencies through occlusion-aware inpainting, confidence-weighted optimization, and explicit contact modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with depth ambiguity, occlusions, and physically inconsistent contacts when reconstructing humans and scenes from single images, limiting their practical applications in VR, robotics, and 3D scene understanding.

Method: Starting from coarse monocular depth and body estimates, PhySIC performs occlusion-aware inpainting, fuses visible depth with unscaled geometry, synthesizes missing support surfaces, and uses confidence-weighted optimization to refine body pose, camera parameters, and global scale while enforcing depth alignment, contact priors, interpenetration avoidance, and 2D reprojection consistency.

Result: PhySIC significantly outperforms baselines, reducing mean per-vertex scene error from 641mm to 227mm, halving PA-MPJPE to 42mm, and improving contact F1 from 0.09 to 0.51. It handles multiple humans efficiently (9s for optimization, <27s end-to-end) and produces realistic interactions.

Conclusion: PhySIC advances scalable 3D scene understanding by converting single images into physically plausible 3D human-scene pairs, enabling realistic foot-floor interactions, natural seating, and plausible reconstructions of heavily occluded furniture.

Abstract: Reconstructing metrically accurate humans and their surrounding scenes from a
single image is crucial for virtual reality, robotics, and comprehensive 3D
scene understanding. However, existing methods struggle with depth ambiguity,
occlusions, and physically inconsistent contacts. To address these challenges,
we introduce PhySIC, a framework for physically plausible Human-Scene
Interaction and Contact reconstruction. PhySIC recovers metrically consistent
SMPL-X human meshes, dense scene surfaces, and vertex-level contact maps within
a shared coordinate frame from a single RGB image. Starting from coarse
monocular depth and body estimates, PhySIC performs occlusion-aware inpainting,
fuses visible depth with unscaled geometry for a robust metric scaffold, and
synthesizes missing support surfaces like floors. A confidence-weighted
optimization refines body pose, camera parameters, and global scale by jointly
enforcing depth alignment, contact priors, interpenetration avoidance, and 2D
reprojection consistency. Explicit occlusion masking safeguards invisible
regions against implausible configurations. PhySIC is efficient, requiring only
9 seconds for joint human-scene optimization and under 27 seconds end-to-end.
It naturally handles multiple humans, enabling reconstruction of diverse
interactions. Empirically, PhySIC outperforms single-image baselines, reducing
mean per-vertex scene error from 641 mm to 227 mm, halving PA-MPJPE to 42 mm,
and improving contact F1 from 0.09 to 0.51. Qualitative results show realistic
foot-floor interactions, natural seating, and plausible reconstructions of
heavily occluded furniture. By converting a single image into a physically
plausible 3D human-scene pair, PhySIC advances scalable 3D scene understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfiniHuman is a framework that distills foundation models to generate unlimited, richly annotated 3D human data at minimal cost, enabling realistic and controllable avatar generation with unprecedented diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating realistic 3D human avatars covering broad attribute ranges is challenging due to the prohibitive cost and limited scale/diversity of manually captured datasets.

Method: Proposes InfiniHumanData (automatic pipeline using vision-language/image generation models) and InfiniHumanGen (diffusion-based generative model conditioned on text, body shape, and clothing assets).

Result: Generated 111K identities with unprecedented diversity, indistinguishable from scan renderings in user studies. Achieves significant improvements in visual quality, generation speed, and controllability over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Enables high-quality avatar generation with fine-grained control at effectively unbounded scale through a practical and affordable solution.

Abstract: Generating realistic and controllable 3D human avatars is a long-standing
challenge, particularly when covering broad attribute ranges such as ethnicity,
age, clothing styles, and detailed body shapes. Capturing and annotating
large-scale human datasets for training generative models is prohibitively
expensive and limited in scale and diversity. The central question we address
in this paper is: Can existing foundation models be distilled to generate
theoretically unbounded, richly annotated 3D human data? We introduce
InfiniHuman, a framework that synergistically distills these models to produce
richly annotated human data at minimal cost and with theoretically unlimited
scalability. We propose InfiniHumanData, a fully automatic pipeline that
leverages vision-language and image generation models to create a large-scale
multi-modal dataset. User study shows our automatically generated identities
are undistinguishable from scan renderings. InfiniHumanData contains 111K
identities spanning unprecedented diversity. Each identity is annotated with
multi-granularity text descriptions, multi-view RGB images, detailed clothing
images, and SMPL body-shape parameters. Building on this dataset, we propose
InfiniHumanGen, a diffusion-based generative pipeline conditioned on text, body
shape, and clothing assets. InfiniHumanGen enables fast, realistic, and
precisely controllable avatar generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in visual quality,
generation speed, and controllability. Our approach enables high-quality avatar
generation with fine-grained control at effectively unbounded scale through a
practical and affordable solution. We will publicly release the automatic data
generation pipeline, the comprehensive InfiniHumanData dataset, and the
InfiniHumanGen models at https://yuxuan-xue.com/infini-human.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified framework that simultaneously predicts 6D pose, size, and dense shape from single RGB-D images without requiring CAD models or category labels, achieving real-time performance and strong zero-shot generalization across 300+ categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 6D pose estimation methods rely on object-specific priors like CAD models or suffer from limited generalization due to pose-shape entanglement and multi-stage pipelines, limiting their applicability in robotics.

Method: Fuses dense 2D features from vision foundation models with partial 3D point clouds using Transformer encoder enhanced by Mixture-of-Experts, with parallel decoders for pose-size estimation and shape reconstruction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on seen categories and remarkably strong zero-shot generalization to unseen real-world objects across four benchmarks (SOPE, ROPE, ObjaversePose, HANDAL) spanning 300+ categories, with real-time inference at 28 FPS.

Conclusion: Establishes a new standard for open-set 6D understanding in robotics and embodied AI by providing a category-agnostic framework that eliminates the need for templates, CAD models, or category labels at test time.

Abstract: Estimating an object's 6D pose, size, and shape from visual input is a
fundamental problem in computer vision, with critical applications in robotic
grasping and manipulation. Existing methods either rely on object-specific
priors such as CAD models or templates, or suffer from limited generalization
across categories due to pose-shape entanglement and multi-stage pipelines. In
this work, we propose a unified, category-agnostic framework that
simultaneously predicts 6D pose, size, and dense shape from a single RGB-D
image, without requiring templates, CAD models, or category labels at test
time. Our model fuses dense 2D features from vision foundation models with
partial 3D point clouds using a Transformer encoder enhanced by a
Mixture-of-Experts, and employs parallel decoders for pose-size estimation and
shape reconstruction, achieving real-time inference at 28 FPS. Trained solely
on synthetic data from 149 categories in the SOPE dataset, our framework is
evaluated on four diverse benchmarks SOPE, ROPE, ObjaversePose, and HANDAL,
spanning over 300 categories. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on seen
categories while demonstrating remarkably strong zero-shot generalization to
unseen real-world objects, establishing a new standard for open-set 6D

### [217] [Diffusion Transformers with Representation Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11690)
*Boyang Zheng,Nanye Ma,Shengbang Tong,Saining Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes replacing traditional VAEs with Representation Autoencoders (RAEs) using pretrained representation encoders (DINO, SigLIP, MAE) for diffusion transformers, achieving better image generation quality and faster convergence without auxiliary losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DiTs rely on outdated VAE encoders that have limitations: outdated backbones, low-dimensional latent spaces restricting information capacity, and weak representations from purely reconstruction-based training that limit generative quality.

Method: Replace VAE with pretrained representation encoders (DINO, SigLIP, MAE) paired with trained decoders to form RAEs. Address high-dimensional latent space challenges with theoretically motivated solutions and use a DiT variant with lightweight DDT head.

Result: Achieved strong image generation results on ImageNet: 1.51 FID at 256x256 (no guidance) and 1.13 FID at both 256x256 and 512x512 (with guidance). Faster convergence without auxiliary representation alignment losses.

Conclusion: RAE offers clear advantages over traditional VAEs and should be the new default for diffusion transformer training, providing both high-quality reconstructions and semantically rich latent spaces.

Abstract: Latent generative modeling, where a pretrained autoencoder maps pixels into a
latent space for the diffusion process, has become the standard strategy for
Diffusion Transformers (DiT); however, the autoencoder component has barely
evolved. Most DiTs continue to rely on the original VAE encoder, which
introduces several limitations: outdated backbones that compromise
architectural simplicity, low-dimensional latent spaces that restrict
information capacity, and weak representations that result from purely
reconstruction-based training and ultimately limit generative quality. In this
work, we explore replacing the VAE with pretrained representation encoders
(e.g., DINO, SigLIP, MAE) paired with trained decoders, forming what we term
Representation Autoencoders (RAEs). These models provide both high-quality
reconstructions and semantically rich latent spaces, while allowing for a
scalable transformer-based architecture. Since these latent spaces are
typically high-dimensional, a key challenge is enabling diffusion transformers
to operate effectively within them. We analyze the sources of this difficulty,
propose theoretically motivated solutions, and validate them empirically. Our
approach achieves faster convergence without auxiliary representation alignment
losses. Using a DiT variant equipped with a lightweight, wide DDT head, we
achieve strong image generation results on ImageNet: 1.51 FID at 256x256 (no
guidance) and 1.13 at both 256x256 and 512x512 (with guidance). RAE offers
clear advantages and should be the new default for diffusion transformer
training.

*Sarah Harkins Dayton,Hayden Everett,Ioannis Schizas,David L. Boothe Jr.,Vasileios Maroulas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new Bayesian topological CNN that combines topology-aware learning with Bayesian sampling to improve training efficiency, reduce calibration error, and provide better uncertainty quantification in image classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard CNNs require large datasets, produce overconfident predictions, and lack uncertainty quantification. The paper aims to address these limitations by integrating topological information with Bayesian methods.

Method: Proposes a Bayesian topological CNN that uses manifold information to accelerate training, places prior distributions on network parameters, learns appropriate posteriors, and includes a consistency condition in the learning cost to modify prior distributions.

Result: The model outperforms conventional CNNs, Bayesian neural networks, and topological CNNs on benchmark datasets, especially with limited or corrupted training data. It provides better uncertainty quantification and more readily identifies out-of-distribution examples.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach combining topological learning with Bayesian methods shows potential for more efficient and robust image classification, particularly in data-scarce or uncertain scenarios.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been established as the main
workhorse in image data processing; nonetheless, they require large amounts of
data to train, often produce overconfident predictions, and frequently lack the
ability to quantify the uncertainty of their predictions. To address these
concerns, we propose a new Bayesian topological CNN that promotes a novel
interplay between topology-aware learning and Bayesian sampling. Specifically,
it utilizes information from important manifolds to accelerate training while
reducing calibration error by placing prior distributions on network parameters
and properly learning appropriate posteriors. One important contribution of our
work is the inclusion of a consistency condition in the learning cost, which
can effectively modify the prior distributions to improve the performance of
our novel network architecture. We evaluate the model on benchmark image
classification datasets and demonstrate its superiority over conventional CNNs,
Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), and topological CNNs. In particular, we supply
evidence that our method provides an advantage in situations where training
data is limited or corrupted. Furthermore, we show that the new model allows
for better uncertainty quantification than standard BNNs since it can more
readily identify examples of out-of-distribution data on which it has not been
trained. Our results highlight the potential of our novel hybrid approach for
more efficient and robust image classification.

*Haoran Feng,Dizhe Zhang,Xiangtai Li,Bo Du,Lu Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiT360 is a DiT-based framework for panoramic image generation that uses hybrid training on perspective and panoramic data, addressing data scarcity issues through inter-domain transformation and intra-domain augmentation at both image and token levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The main motivation is to address the lack of large-scale, high-quality real-world panoramic data, which causes issues in maintaining geometric fidelity and photorealism in panoramic image generation, taking a data-centric approach rather than focusing on model design.

Method: DiT360 uses hybrid training with key modules for inter-domain transformation and intra-domain augmentation. At image level: cross-domain knowledge through perspective guidance and panoramic refinement. At token level: hybrid supervision with circular padding for boundary continuity, yaw loss for rotational robustness, and cube loss for distortion awareness.

Result: Extensive experiments on text-to-panorama, inpainting, and outpainting tasks demonstrate better boundary consistency and image fidelity across eleven quantitative metrics compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: The proposed DiT360 framework effectively addresses panoramic image generation challenges through data-centric hybrid training approach, achieving superior performance in maintaining geometric fidelity and photorealism across multiple generation tasks.

Abstract: In this work, we propose DiT360, a DiT-based framework that performs hybrid
training on perspective and panoramic data for panoramic image generation. For
the issues of maintaining geometric fidelity and photorealism in generation
quality, we attribute the main reason to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,
real-world panoramic data, where such a data-centric view differs from prior
methods that focus on model design. Basically, DiT360 has several key modules
for inter-domain transformation and intra-domain augmentation, applied at both
the pre-VAE image level and the post-VAE token level. At the image level, we
incorporate cross-domain knowledge through perspective image guidance and
panoramic refinement, which enhance perceptual quality while regularizing
diversity and photorealism. At the token level, hybrid supervision is applied
across multiple modules, which include circular padding for boundary
continuity, yaw loss for rotational robustness, and cube loss for distortion
awareness. Extensive experiments on text-to-panorama, inpainting, and
outpainting tasks demonstrate that our method achieves better boundary
consistency and image fidelity across eleven quantitative metrics. Our code is

*Ayush Shrivastava,Sanyam Mehta,Daniel Geng,Andrew Owens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pretrained video diffusion models can perform zero-shot point tracking by marking query points with colored markers and regenerating videos, outperforming prior zero-shot methods and competing with specialized self-supervised models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trackers and video generators solve related problems - analyzing vs synthesizing motion. This connection enables leveraging pretrained video diffusion models for tracking tasks without additional training.

Method: Place distinctively colored markers at query points, then regenerate the rest of the video from intermediate noise levels to propagate markers across frames. Use unedited initial frames as negative prompts to maintain marker visibility.

Result: The emergent tracks outperform prior zero-shot methods, persist through occlusions, and achieve performance competitive with specialized self-supervised tracking models.

Conclusion: Video diffusion models inherently possess tracking capabilities that can be unlocked through simple prompting techniques, bridging the gap between video generation and motion analysis tasks.

Abstract: Trackers and video generators solve closely related problems: the former
analyze motion, while the latter synthesize it. We show that this connection
enables pretrained video diffusion models to perform zero-shot point tracking
by simply prompting them to visually mark points as they move over time. We
place a distinctively colored marker at the query point, then regenerate the
rest of the video from an intermediate noise level. This propagates the marker
across frames, tracing the point's trajectory. To ensure that the marker
remains visible in this counterfactual generation, despite such markers being
unlikely in natural videos, we use the unedited initial frame as a negative
prompt. Through experiments with multiple image-conditioned video diffusion
models, we find that these "emergent" tracks outperform those of prior
zero-shot methods and persist through occlusions, often obtaining performance
that is competitive with specialized self-supervised models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ev4DGS is the first method for novel view rendering of non-rigidly deforming objects from monocular event streams alone, without requiring RGB inputs, using deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing event-based rendering approaches for non-rigid objects require additional sparse RGB inputs, creating practical limitations. It was unknown if similar models could be learned from event streams only.

Method: Regresses a deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting representation using: 1) a loss relating model outputs with 2D event observation space, and 2) a coarse 3D deformation model trained from binary masks generated from events.

Result: Experimental comparisons on synthetic and real datasets show Ev4DGS is valid and outperforms multiple naive baselines in this setting.

Conclusion: Ev4DGS successfully demonstrates novel view rendering of non-rigid objects from event streams only, overcoming previous limitations that required RGB inputs.

Abstract: Event cameras offer various advantages for novel view rendering compared to
synchronously operating RGB cameras, and efficient event-based techniques
supporting rigid scenes have been recently demonstrated in the literature. In
the case of non-rigid objects, however, existing approaches additionally
require sparse RGB inputs, which can be a substantial practical limitation; it
remains unknown if similar models could be learned from event streams only.
This paper sheds light on this challenging open question and introduces Ev4DGS,
i.e., the first approach for novel view rendering of non-rigidly deforming
objects in the explicit observation space (i.e., as RGB or greyscale images)
from monocular event streams. Our method regresses a deformable 3D Gaussian
Splatting representation through 1) a loss relating the outputs of the
estimated model with the 2D event observation space, and 2) a coarse 3D
deformation model trained from binary masks generated from events. We perform
experimental comparisons on existing synthetic and newly recorded real datasets
with non-rigid objects. The results demonstrate the validity of Ev4DGS and its
superior performance compared to multiple naive baselines that can be applied
in our setting. We will release our models and the datasets used in the
evaluation for research purposes; see the project webpage:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Diffusion Policy and ACT methods lack temporal context, leading to local optima traps and excessive repetitive actions in temporal sequential tasks for humanoid robots.

Method: Integrates Classifier-Free Guidance with conditional and unconditional models, using timestep inputs to track task progression and ensure precise cycle termination. Dynamically adjusts action predictions based on task phase with tuned guidance factor.

Result: Real-world experiments show high success rates and minimal repetitive actions. Model effectively terminates actions and performance is sensitive to component adjustments and parameters.

Conclusion: The framework significantly enhances deterministic control and execution reliability for sequential robotic tasks.

Abstract: Temporal sequential tasks challenge humanoid robots, as existing Diffusion
Policy (DP) and Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT) methods often lack
temporal context, resulting in local optima traps and excessive repetitive
actions. To address these issues, this paper introduces a Classifier-Free
Guidance-Based Diffusion Policy (CFG-DP), a novel framework to enhance DP by
integrating Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) with conditional and unconditional
models. Specifically, CFG leverages timestep inputs to track task progression
and ensure precise cycle termination. It dynamically adjusts action predictions
based on task phase, using a guidance factor tuned to balance temporal
coherence and action accuracy. Real-world experiments on a humanoid robot
demonstrate high success rates and minimal repetitive actions. Furthermore, we
assessed the model's ability to terminate actions and examined how different
components and parameter adjustments affect its performance. This framework
significantly enhances deterministic control and execution reliability for
sequential robotic tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes two methods for cross-sensor tactile image generation: Touch2Touch (end-to-end with paired data) and T2D2 (uses intermediate depth representation without paired data), enabling sensor-specific models to work across different tactile sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of developing general-purpose tactile representations due to diverse visuo-tactile sensor designs, where most models are tied to specific sensors.

Method: Two approaches: 1) Touch2Touch - end-to-end method using paired data, 2) T2D2 - builds intermediate depth representation without requiring paired data. Both enable cross-sensor touch generation.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on downstream tasks including in-hand pose estimation and behavior cloning, successfully transferring models trained on one sensor to another.

Conclusion: The proposed models offer flexible solutions for sensor translation depending on data availability and application needs, enabling broader use of sensor-specific models across multiple tactile sensors.

Abstract: Today's visuo-tactile sensors come in many shapes and sizes, making it
challenging to develop general-purpose tactile representations. This is because
most models are tied to a specific sensor design. To address this challenge, we
propose two approaches to cross-sensor image generation. The first is an
end-to-end method that leverages paired data (Touch2Touch). The second method
builds an intermediate depth representation and does not require paired data
(T2D2: Touch-to-Depth-to-Touch). Both methods enable the use of sensor-specific
models across multiple sensors via the cross-sensor touch generation process.
Together, these models offer flexible solutions for sensor translation,
depending on data availability and application needs. We demonstrate their
effectiveness on downstream tasks such as in-hand pose estimation and behavior
cloning, successfully transferring models trained on one sensor to another.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VG-Mapping is an online 3DGS-based mapping system for semi-static scenes that uses a hybrid representation combining 3D Gaussian Splatting with TSDF-based voxel mapping to efficiently identify and update changed regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maintaining up-to-date maps is crucial for robots in repeated environments, as outdated maps degrade localization and operational efficiency. Current 3DGS methods struggle with efficiently updating changed regions in semi-static scenes.

Method: Proposes a hybrid representation augmenting 3DGS with TSDF-based voxel mapping for change detection, plus a variation-aware density control strategy that inserts/deletes Gaussian primitives in changing regions.

Result: Experimental results show substantial improvements in rendering quality and map update efficiency in semi-static environments compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: VG-Mapping effectively addresses the challenge of updating changed regions in semi-static scenes, providing a practical solution for maintaining current maps in robotic applications.

Abstract: Maintaining an up-to-date map that accurately reflects recent changes in the
environment is crucial, especially for robots that repeatedly traverse the same
space. Failing to promptly update the changed regions can degrade map quality,
resulting in poor localization, inefficient operations, and even lost robots.
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently seen widespread adoption in online
map reconstruction due to its dense, differentiable, and photorealistic
properties, yet accurately and efficiently updating the regions of change
remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose VG-Mapping, a novel online
3DGS-based mapping system tailored for such semi-static scenes. Our approach
introduces a hybrid representation that augments 3DGS with a TSDF-based voxel
map to efficiently identify changed regions in a scene, along with a
variation-aware density control strategy that inserts or deletes Gaussian
primitives in regions undergoing change. Furthermore, to address the absence of
public benchmarks for this task, we construct a RGB-D dataset comprising both
synthetic and real-world semi-static environments. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method substantially improves the rendering quality and
map update efficiency in semi-static scenes. The code and dataset are available

*Chaoran Wang,Jingyuan Sun,Yanhui Zhang,Mingyu Zhang,Changju Wu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A framework using LLMs to dynamically generate behavior trees for heterogeneous multi-robot systems, enabling adaptive task execution and failure recovery through local tree extension or centralized coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional robots with fixed functional attributes cannot efficiently reconfigure strategies in response to task failures or environmental changes in dynamic environments.

Method: Four interconnected modules: task initialization, task assignment, BT update, and failure node detection. Uses LLMs to generate/extend BTs dynamically. Robots tick BTs during execution and can extend trees locally or invoke centralized coordinator (Alex) for reassignment and synchronization.

Result: Validated on 60 tasks across three simulated scenarios and real-world cafe environment. Consistently outperforms baseline approaches in task success rate, robustness, and scalability.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enables long-term cooperative execution in heterogeneous multi-robot teams for complex scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for automatic behavior tree (BT) construction
in heterogeneous multi-robot systems, designed to address the challenges of
adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments. Traditional robots are
limited by fixed functional attributes and cannot efficiently reconfigure their
strategies in response to task failures or environmental changes. To overcome
this limitation, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate and
extend BTs dynamically, combining the reasoning and generalization power of
LLMs with the modularity and recovery capability of BTs. The proposed framework
consists of four interconnected modules task initialization, task assignment,
BT update, and failure node detection which operate in a closed loop. Robots
tick their BTs during execution, and upon encountering a failure node, they can
either extend the tree locally or invoke a centralized virtual coordinator
(Alex) to reassign subtasks and synchronize BTs across peers. This design
enables long-term cooperative execution in heterogeneous teams. We validate the
framework on 60 tasks across three simulated scenarios and in a real-world cafe
environment with a robotic arm and a wheeled-legged robot. Results show that
our method consistently outperforms baseline approaches in task success rate,
robustness, and scalability, demonstrating its effectiveness for multi-robot
collaboration in complex scenarios.

### [226] [FORM: Fixed-Lag Odometry with Reparative Mapping utilizing Rotating LiDAR Sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09966)
*Easton R. Potokar,Taylor Pool,Daniel McGann,Michael Kaess*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FORM is a LiDAR Odometry method that uses a densely connected factor graph for smoothing while maintaining real-time performance with a single iterative map, addressing issues of error propagation and jittery trajectories in submap-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most LiDAR Odometry methods use submap-based approaches that propagate pose estimation errors to fixed submaps, causing jittery trajectories and degrading future registrations. Existing smoothing methods require matching against multiple scans and don't achieve real-time performance.

Method: Fixed-Lag Odometry with Reparative Mapping (FORM) uses a densely connected factor graph for smoothing while utilizing a single iterative map for matching. This allows active correction of the local map as pose estimates are refined.

Result: FORM achieves real-time performance and provides smooth trajectory estimates. Evaluation on various datasets shows it is robust, accurate, and outperforms prior state-of-the-art LiDAR Odometry methods.

Conclusion: FORM successfully addresses the limitations of submap-based LiDAR Odometry by combining factor graph smoothing with a single iterative map, enabling real-time performance while correcting pose estimation errors and producing smooth trajectories.

Abstract: Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors have become a de-facto sensor for
many robot state estimation tasks, spurring development of many LiDAR Odometry
(LO) methods in recent years. While some smoothing-based LO methods have been
proposed, most require matching against multiple scans, resulting in
sub-real-time performance. Due to this, most prior works estimate a single
state at a time and are ``submap''-based. This architecture propagates any
error in pose estimation to the fixed submap and can cause jittery trajectories
and degrade future registrations. We propose Fixed-Lag Odometry with Reparative
Mapping (FORM), a LO method that performs smoothing over a densely connected
factor graph while utilizing a single iterative map for matching. This allows
for both real-time performance and active correction of the local map as pose
estimates are further refined. We evaluate on a wide variety of datasets to
show that FORM is robust, accurate, real-time, and provides smooth trajectory
estimates when compared to prior state-of-the-art LO methods.

TL;DR: ATRos is an RL-based hybrid locomotion framework for wheeled-legged robots that intelligently coordinates wheel and leg movements without predefined gait patterns, achieving improved terrain adaptability and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hybrid locomotion combines the agility of legged locomotion with the efficiency of wheeled motion, but whole-body control remains challenging for wheeled-legged robots.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning with a prediction policy network to estimate environmental states from proprioceptive sensors, and an actor-critic network to produce optimal joint commands without predefined gait patterns.

Result: Validated through simulations and real-world experiments across diverse terrains (flat ground, stairs, grassy surfaces), showing robust performance and generalization capability on unseen terrains.

Conclusion: The RL-based hybrid locomotion framework successfully enables wheeled-legged robots to perform adaptive walking-driving motions with improved terrain adaptability and energy efficiency.

Abstract: Hybrid locomotion of wheeled-legged robots has recently attracted increasing
attention due to their advantages of combining the agility of legged locomotion
and the efficiency of wheeled motion. But along with expanded performance, the
whole-body control of wheeled-legged robots remains challenging for hybrid
locomotion. In this paper, we present ATRos, a reinforcement learning
(RL)-based hybrid locomotion framework to achieve hybrid walking-driving
motions on the wheeled-legged robot. Without giving predefined gait patterns,
our planner aims to intelligently coordinate simultaneous wheel and leg
movements, thereby achieving improved terrain adaptability and improved energy
efficiency. Based on RL techniques, our approach constructs a prediction policy
network that could estimate external environmental states from proprioceptive
sensory information, and the outputs are then fed into an actor critic network
to produce optimal joint commands. The feasibility of the proposed framework is
validated through both simulations and real-world experiments across diverse
terrains, including flat ground, stairs, and grassy surfaces. The hybrid
locomotion framework shows robust performance over various unseen terrains,
highlighting its generalization capability.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel hybrid gripper for tomato harvesting using soft auxetic lattice in different orientations (0°, 30°, 45°, 60°) shows that lattice orientation significantly affects compliance, contact forces, and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agricultural automation needs gentle handling solutions to reduce labor-intensive fruit/vegetable harvesting and minimize post-harvest losses, with soft robotics offering promising approaches.

Method: Developed a hybrid gripper with rigid outer frame and soft auxetic internal lattice in six-finger 3D caging-effect design. Evaluated different auxetic lattice orientations using experimental validation, 2D Digital Image Correlation, and nonlinear finite element analysis.

Result: Lattice orientation strongly influences gripper performance - different configurations (0°, 30°, 45°, 60°) show distinct advantages in compliance, contact forces, and energy efficiency, enabling optimization for specific grasping requirements.

Conclusion: Tailoring auxetic geometries can optimize robotic gripper performance for precision agriculture, providing new insights into soft-rigid hybrid gripper design to advance automation while minimizing crop damage.

Abstract: The agricultural sector is rapidly evolving to meet growing global food
demands, yet tasks like fruit and vegetable handling remain labor-intensive,
causing inefficiencies and post-harvest losses. Automation, particularly
selective harvesting, offers a viable solution, with soft robotics emerging as
a key enabler. This study introduces a novel hybrid gripper for tomato
harvesting, incorporating a rigid outer frame with a soft auxetic internal
lattice. The six-finger, 3D caging-effect design enables gentle yet secure
grasping in unstructured environments. Uniquely, the work investigates the
effect of auxetic lattice orientation on grasping conformability, combining
experimental validation with 2D Digital Image Correlation (DIC) and nonlinear
finite element analysis (FEA). Auxetic configurations with unit cell
inclinations of 0 deg, 30 deg, 45 deg, and 60 deg are evaluated, and their
grasping forces, deformation responses, and motor torque requirements are
systematically compared. Results demonstrate that lattice orientation strongly
influences compliance, contact forces, and energy efficiency, with distinct
advantages across configurations. This comparative framework highlights the
novelty of tailoring auxetic geometries to optimize robotic gripper
performance. The findings provide new insights into soft-rigid hybrid gripper
design, advancing automation strategies for precision agriculture while
minimizing crop damage.

*Mingke Lu,Shuaikang Wang,Meng Guo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LOMORO is an online coordination scheme for multi-robot systems that enables collaborative target monitoring with resource constraints, ensuring bounded monitoring intervals and resource levels while minimizing active robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-term monitoring of dynamic targets is challenging for humans or single robots. Existing multi-robot approaches often use all available robots without minimizing fleet size and neglect resource constraints like battery and memory.

Method: Three core components: (I) modeling multi-robot task assignment with resource and monitoring interval constraints; (II) resource-aware task coordination algorithm with high-level target assignment and low-level multi-objective routing via Martin's algorithm; (III) online adaptation for unpredictable target behaviors and robot failures.

Result: The method ensures explicitly upper-bounded monitoring intervals for all targets and lower-bounded resource levels for all robots while minimizing the average number of active robots. Validated through large-scale simulations against baselines under various conditions.

Conclusion: LOMORO provides an effective online coordination scheme for collaborative target monitoring that addresses resource constraints and minimizes robot deployment while maintaining monitoring quality.

Abstract: Long-term monitoring of numerous dynamic targets can be tedious for a human
operator and infeasible for a single robot, e.g., to monitor wild flocks,
detect intruders, search and rescue. Fleets of autonomous robots can be
effective by acting collaboratively and concurrently. However, the online
coordination is challenging due to the unknown behaviors of the targets and the
limited perception of each robot. Existing work often deploys all robots
available without minimizing the fleet size, or neglects the constraints on
their resources such as battery and memory. This work proposes an online
coordination scheme called LOMORO for collaborative target monitoring, path
routing and resource charging. It includes three core components: (I) the
modeling of multi-robot task assignment problem under the constraints on
resources and monitoring intervals; (II) the resource-aware task coordination
algorithm iterates between the high-level assignment of dynamic targets and the
low-level multi-objective routing via the Martin's algorithm; (III) the online
adaptation algorithm in case of unpredictable target behaviors and robot
failures. It ensures the explicitly upper-bounded monitoring intervals for all
targets and the lower-bounded resource levels for all robots, while minimizing
the average number of active robots. The proposed methods are validated
extensively via large-scale simulations against several baselines, under
different road networks, robot velocities, charging rates and monitoring
intervals.

*Keidai Iiyama,Grace Gao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper analyzes ionospheric and plasmaspheric delays affecting GNSS signals used for lunar positioning, showing delays can exceed 100m during high solar activity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unmodeled ionospheric and plasmaspheric delays remain a significant error source for GNSS-based lunar navigation, particularly due to unique signal geometry and extended propagation paths.

Method: Used Global Core Plasma Model (GCPM) and custom low-cost ray-tracing algorithm to simulate first-, second-, and third-order group delays and excess path length from ray bending for GNSS signals at lunar orbit and south pole under varying solar/geomagnetic conditions.

Result: Mean group delays are typically ~1m but can exceed 100m for low-altitude ray paths during high solar activity. Bending delays are smaller but non-negligible for low-altitude paths. Signal frequency, geomagnetic Kp index, and solar R12 index significantly influence delays.

Conclusion: These findings inform the design of robust positioning and timing algorithms for terrestrial GNSS signals used in lunar navigation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in lunar positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) have
demonstrated that terrestrial GNSS signals, including weak sidelobe
transmissions, can be exploited for lunar spacecraft positioning and timing.
While GNSS-based navigation at the Moon has been validated recently, unmodeled
ionospheric and plasmaspheric delays remain a significant error source,
particularly given the unique signal geometry and extended propagation paths.
This paper characterizes these delays using the Global Core Plasma Model (GCPM)
and a custom low-cost ray-tracing algorithm that iteratively solves for bent
signal paths. We simulate first-, second-, and third-order group delays, as
well as excess path length from ray bending, for GNSS signals received at both
lunar orbit and the lunar south pole under varying solar and geomagnetic
conditions. Results show that mean group delays are typically on the order of 1
m, but can exceed 100 m for low-altitude ray paths during high solar activity,
while bending delays are generally smaller but non-negligible for low-altitude
ray paths. We also quantify the influence of signal frequency, geomagnetic
$K_p$ index, and solar R12 index. These findings inform the design of robust
positioning and timing algorithms that utilize terrestrial GNSS signals.

### [231] [Beyond ADE and FDE: A Comprehensive Evaluation Framework for Safety-Critical Prediction in Multi-Agent Autonomous Driving Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10086)
*Feifei Liu,Haozhe Wang,Zejun Wei,Qirong Lu,Yiyang Wen,Xiaoyu Tang,Jingyan Jiang,Zhijian He*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel testing framework to evaluate autonomous driving prediction models beyond traditional metrics like ADE and FDE, focusing on complex scenarios involving agent interactions, map context, and spatial distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods using simple metrics like ADE and FDE fail to capture nuanced prediction behavior in complex, interactive, and safety-critical driving scenarios, lacking systematic testing of model robustness across multi-agent interactions.

Method: The authors propose a novel testing framework that evaluates prediction performance under diverse scene structures including map context, agent density, and spatial distribution, with empirical analysis quantifying the impact of agent proximity on trajectory prediction.

Result: The framework identifies scenario-specific failure cases not exposed by traditional metrics, highlights key vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art prediction models, and demonstrates the differential impact of agent proximity on target trajectory prediction.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables rigorous, safety-driven prediction validation, contributing to identifying failure-prone corner cases and developing robust, certifiable prediction systems for autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: Current evaluation methods for autonomous driving prediction models rely
heavily on simplistic metrics such as Average Displacement Error (ADE) and
Final Displacement Error (FDE). While these metrics offer basic performance
assessments, they fail to capture the nuanced behavior of prediction modules
under complex, interactive, and safety-critical driving scenarios. For
instance, existing benchmarks do not distinguish the influence of nearby versus
distant agents, nor systematically test model robustness across varying
multi-agent interactions. This paper addresses this critical gap by proposing a
novel testing framework that evaluates prediction performance under diverse
scene structures, saying, map context, agent density and spatial distribution.
Through extensive empirical analysis, we quantify the differential impact of
agent proximity on target trajectory prediction and identify scenario-specific
failure cases that are not exposed by traditional metrics. Our findings
highlight key vulnerabilities in current state-of-the-art prediction models and
demonstrate the importance of scenario-aware evaluation. The proposed framework
lays the groundwork for rigorous, safety-driven prediction validation,
contributing significantly to the identification of failure-prone corner cases
and the development of robust, certifiable prediction systems for autonomous
vehicles.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a controllable multi-view world model for evaluating and improving generalist robot policies, addressing the challenges of costly real-world rollouts and expert-labeled corrective data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating and improving generalist robot policies with unfamiliar objects and instructions requires extensive real-world rollouts and expert-labeled corrective data, which are slow, costly, and difficult to scale.

Method: Proposes a controllable multi-view world model with pose-conditioned memory retrieval for long-horizon consistency and frame-level action conditioning for precise action control, trained on the DROID dataset (95k trajectories, 564 scenes).

Result: The model generates spatially and temporally consistent trajectories for over 20 seconds under novel scenarios and new camera placements, accurately ranks policy performance without real-world rollouts, and improves policy success by 44.7% through supervised fine-tuning with synthesized successful trajectories.

Conclusion: The controllable world model provides a scalable alternative to real-world evaluation and improvement of generalist robot policies, enabling accurate performance ranking and significant policy enhancement through imagination-based fine-tuning.

Abstract: Generalist robot policies can now perform a wide range of manipulation
skills, but evaluating and improving their ability with unfamiliar objects and
instructions remains a significant challenge. Rigorous evaluation requires a
large number of real-world rollouts, while systematic improvement demands
additional corrective data with expert labels. Both of these processes are
slow, costly, and difficult to scale. World models offer a promising, scalable
alternative by enabling policies to rollout within imagination space. However,
a key challenge is building a controllable world model that can handle
multi-step interactions with generalist robot policies. This requires a world
model compatible with modern generalist policies by supporting multi-view
prediction, fine-grained action control, and consistent long-horizon
interactions, which is not achieved by previous works. In this paper, we make a
step forward by introducing a controllable multi-view world model that can be
used to evaluate and improve the instruction-following ability of generalist
robot policies. Our model maintains long-horizon consistency with a
pose-conditioned memory retrieval mechanism and achieves precise action control
through frame-level action conditioning. Trained on the DROID dataset (95k
trajectories, 564 scenes), our model generates spatially and temporally
consistent trajectories under novel scenarios and new camera placements for
over 20 seconds. We show that our method can accurately rank policy performance
without real-world robot rollouts. Moreover, by synthesizing successful
trajectories in imagination and using them for supervised fine-tuning, our
approach can improve policy success by 44.7\%.

*LinFeng Li,Jian Zhao,Yuan Xie,Xin Tan,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new paradigm shift from Path Imitation to Decision Understanding for training Large Vision-Language Models in navigation, introducing Compass-Data-22k dataset and a gap-aware hybrid reward function that enables agents to develop an internal compass for goal navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLM training for navigation relies on imitating expert trajectories, which limits exploration and generalization by reducing navigation to sequence replication rather than true decision-making understanding.

Method: Two core contributions: 1) Compass-Data-22k dataset with 22k trajectories and RFT subset annotating all feasible actions with A* geodesic distances, 2) Gap-aware hybrid reward function that dynamically adapts feedback to decision certainty, integrated into SFT-then-RFT training recipe.

Result: The 7B CompassNav agent sets new state-of-the-art on Goal navigation benchmarks, outperforming larger proprietary models, and achieves robust real-world goal navigation on a physical robot.

Conclusion: Shifting from path imitation to decision understanding enables agents to develop true navigation comprehension through an internal compass that evaluates relative quality of all possible moves, leading to superior performance and real-world applicability.

Abstract: The dominant paradigm for training Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in
navigation relies on imitating expert trajectories. This approach reduces the
complex navigation task to a sequence-to-sequence replication of a single
correct path, fundamentally limiting the agent's ability to explore and
generalize. In this work, we argue for and introduce a new paradigm: a shift
from Path Imitation to Decision Understanding. The goal of this paradigm is to
build agents that do not just follow, but truly understand how to navigate. We
materialize this through two core contributions: first, we introduce
Compass-Data-22k, a novel 22k-trajectory dataset.Its Reinforcement Fine-Tuning
(RFT) subset provides a panoramic view of the decision landscape by annotating
all feasible actions with A* geodesic distances. Second, we design a novel
gap-aware hybrid reward function that dynamically adapts its feedback to
decision certainty, shifting between decisive signals for optimal actions and
nuanced scores to encourage exploration. Integrated into an SFT-then-RFT
recipe, our CompassNav agent is trained not to memorize static routes, but to
develop an internal ``compass'' that constantly intuits the direction to the
goal by evaluating the relative quality of all possible moves. This approach
enables our 7B agent to set a new state-of-the-art on Goal navigation
benchmarks, outperforming even larger proprietary models, and achieve robust
real-world goal navigation on a physical robot.

TL;DR: Dejavu is a post-deployment learning framework that enhances frozen VLA policies by retrieving and conditioning on successful past experiences through an Experience Feedback Network, enabling continual improvement without weight updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied agents become static after deployment and cannot acquire new knowledge to improve task performance, limiting their adaptability and robustness in real-world environments.

Method: Uses an Experience Feedback Network (EFN) that retrieves successful execution memories and conditions action prediction on this guidance. Employs reinforcement learning with semantic similarity rewards to align predicted actions with past successful behaviors.

Result: Experiments across diverse embodied tasks show significant improvements in adaptability, robustness, and success rates compared to frozen baselines, with agents demonstrating learning from experience despite fixed weights.

Conclusion: Dejavu presents a promising approach for creating embodied agents that can continually refine their behavior after deployment through experience-based learning without requiring model weight updates.

Abstract: Embodied agents face a fundamental limitation: once deployed in real-world
environments to perform specific tasks, they are unable to acquire new useful
knowledge to enhance task performance. In this paper, we propose a general
post-deployment learning framework called Dejavu, which employs an Experience
Feedback Network (EFN) and augments the frozen Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
policy with retrieved execution memories. EFN automatically identifies
contextually successful prior action experiences and conditions action
prediction on this retrieved guidance. We adopt reinforcement learning with
semantic similarity rewards on EFN to ensure that the predicted actions align
with past successful behaviors under current observations. During deployment,
EFN continually enriches its memory with new trajectories, enabling the agent
to exhibit "learning from experience" despite fixed weights. Experiments across
diverse embodied tasks show that EFN significantly improves adaptability,
robustness, and success rates over frozen baselines. These results highlight a
promising path toward embodied agents that continually refine their behavior
after deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current single-humanoid methods suffer from the isolation issue, ignoring inter-agent dynamics and causing misaligned contacts, interpenetrations, and unrealistic motions. The true promise of humanoid robotics lies in enabling physically grounded, socially meaningful whole-body interactions between multiple humanoids.

Method: Harmanoid comprises two key components: (1) contact-aware motion retargeting that restores inter-body coordination by aligning SMPL contacts with robot vertices, and (2) interaction-driven motion controller that leverages interaction-specific rewards to enforce coordinated keypoints and physically plausible contacts.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that Harmanoid significantly improves interactive motion imitation, surpassing existing single-humanoid frameworks that largely fail in such scenarios.

Conclusion: By explicitly modeling inter-agent contacts and interaction-aware dynamics, Harmanoid captures the coupled behaviors between humanoids that single-humanoid frameworks inherently overlook, enabling realistic multi-humanoid interactions.

Abstract: The true promise of humanoid robotics lies beyond single-agent autonomy: two
or more humanoids must engage in physically grounded, socially meaningful
whole-body interactions that echo the richness of human social interaction.
However, single-humanoid methods suffer from the isolation issue, ignoring
inter-agent dynamics and causing misaligned contacts, interpenetrations, and
unrealistic motions. To address this, we present Harmanoid , a dual-humanoid
motion imitation framework that transfers interacting human motions to two
robots while preserving both kinematic fidelity and physical realism. Harmanoid
comprises two key components: (i) contact-aware motion retargeting, which
restores inter-body coordination by aligning SMPL contacts with robot vertices,
and (ii) interaction-driven motion controller, which leverages
interaction-specific rewards to enforce coordinated keypoints and physically

TL;DR: UF-RNN combines time-series prediction with an active Foresight module that performs internal simulations to minimize predicted variance, enabling selective exploration under uncertainty without requiring failure demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training robots for environments with uncertain states is challenging, and imitation learning methods typically neglect failure scenarios where uncertainty is most pronounced.

Method: Proposed Uncertainty-driven Foresight RNN (UF-RNN) with standard time-series prediction and an active Foresight module that performs internal simulations of multiple future trajectories to refine hidden states and minimize predicted variance.

Result: UF-RNN demonstrated robust adaptation on door-opening tasks in simulation and real-robot settings, showing improved success rates compared to conventional stochastic RNN baselines by leveraging self-induced chaotic dynamics for exploratory behaviors under ambiguity.

Conclusion: Integrating uncertainty-driven foresight into imitation learning pipelines can significantly enhance a robot's ability to handle unpredictable real-world conditions.

Abstract: Training robots to operate effectively in environments with uncertain states,
such as ambiguous object properties or unpredictable interactions, remains a
longstanding challenge in robotics. Imitation learning methods typically rely
on successful examples and often neglect failure scenarios where uncertainty is
most pronounced. To address this limitation, we propose the Uncertainty-driven
Foresight Recurrent Neural Network (UF-RNN), a model that combines standard
time-series prediction with an active "Foresight" module. This module performs
internal simulations of multiple future trajectories and refines the hidden
state to minimize predicted variance, enabling the model to selectively explore
actions under high uncertainty. We evaluate UF-RNN on a door-opening task in
both simulation and a real-robot setting, demonstrating that, despite the
absence of explicit failure demonstrations, the model exhibits robust
adaptation by leveraging self-induced chaotic dynamics in its latent space.
When guided by the Foresight module, these chaotic properties stimulate
exploratory behaviors precisely when the environment is ambiguous, yielding
improved success rates compared to conventional stochastic RNN baselines. These
findings suggest that integrating uncertainty-driven foresight into imitation
learning pipelines can significantly enhance a robot's ability to handle
unpredictable real-world conditions.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes A³RNN, a novel attention model that integrates top-down predictive signals and bottom-up saliency cues through bi-directional attention architecture, showing how structured attentional behavior emerges in robotic learning through mutual adaptation of these mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how structured, human-like attentional behavior emerges through the mutual adaptation of top-down and bottom-up visual attention mechanisms over time in robotic learning.

Method: Proposed A³RNN model with bi-directional attention architecture integrating predictive top-down signals and saliency-based bottom-up cues, evaluated in robotic manipulation tasks using imitation learning.

Result: Attention behaviors evolve from saliency-driven exploration to prediction-driven direction during training. Initially bottom-up attention guides top-down processes, then top-down attention stabilizes and reshapes what is perceived as salient, exhibiting more coherent and interpretable attention patterns than baselines.

Conclusion: The developmental interaction between top-down and bottom-up attention mechanisms through mutual adaptation contributes to robust attention formation, reflecting cognitive science principles and the free-energy framework.

Abstract: This study investigates the developmental interaction between top-down (TD)
and bottom-up (BU) visual attention in robotic learning. Our goal is to
understand how structured, human-like attentional behavior emerges through the
mutual adaptation of TD and BU mechanisms over time. To this end, we propose a
novel attention model $A^3 RNN$ that integrates predictive TD signals and
saliency-based BU cues through a bi-directional attention architecture.
  We evaluate our model in robotic manipulation tasks using imitation learning.
Experimental results show that attention behaviors evolve throughout training,
from saliency-driven exploration to prediction-driven direction. Initially, BU
attention highlights visually salient regions, which guide TD processes, while
as learning progresses, TD attention stabilizes and begins to reshape what is
perceived as salient. This trajectory reflects principles from cognitive
science and the free-energy framework, suggesting the importance of
self-organizing attention through interaction between perception and internal
prediction. Although not explicitly optimized for stability, our model exhibits
more coherent and interpretable attention patterns than baselines, supporting
the idea that developmental mechanisms contribute to robust attention
formation.

Motivation: The lack of a TIAGo++ Omni robot model in Isaac Sim has limited research using this versatile mobile manipulator with omnidirectional movement capabilities in GPU-accelerated simulation environments.

Method: Developed two control models: a physically accurate model replicating real-world wheel dynamics and a lightweight velocity-based model optimized for learning. Used a learning-based calibration approach with minimal trajectory data to approximate the robot's S-shaped velocity profile.

Result: Successfully created and calibrated a simulation model of the TIAGo++ Omni robot for Isaac Sim that approximates real robot behavior, particularly focusing on omnidirectional drive dynamics.

Conclusion: The publicly available simulation integration enables researchers to experiment with the TIAGo++ Omni robot and perform efficient learning-based control in diverse environments using Isaac Sim.

Abstract: Efficient physics simulation has significantly accelerated research progress
in robotics applications such as grasping and assembly. The advent of
GPU-accelerated simulation frameworks like Isaac Sim has particularly empowered
learning-based methods, enabling them to tackle increasingly complex tasks. The
PAL Robotics TIAGo++ Omni is a versatile mobile manipulator equipped with a
mecanum-wheeled base, allowing omnidirectional movement and a wide range of
task capabilities. However, until now, no model of the robot has been available
in Isaac Sim. In this paper, we introduce such a model, calibrated to
approximate the behavior of the real robot, with a focus on its omnidirectional
drive dynamics. We present two control models for the omnidirectional drive: a
physically accurate model that replicates real-world wheel dynamics and a
lightweight velocity-based model optimized for learning-based applications.
With these models, we introduce a learning-based calibration approach to
approximate the real robot's S-shaped velocity profile using minimal trajectory
data recordings. This simulation should allow researchers to experiment with
the robot and perform efficient learning-based control in diverse environments.

Conclusion: The soft prompt approach with embodiment-specific embeddings enables effective cross-embodiment learning, making X-VLA a scalable and high-performing solution for generalist Vision-Language-Action models.

Abstract: Successful generalist Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models rely on effective
training across diverse robotic platforms with large-scale, cross-embodiment,
heterogeneous datasets. To facilitate and leverage the heterogeneity in rich,
diverse robotic data sources, we propose a novel Soft Prompt approach with
minimally added parameters, by infusing prompt learning concepts into
cross-embodiment robot learning and introducing separate sets of learnable
embeddings for each distinct data source. These embeddings serve as
embodiment-specific prompts, which in unity empower VLA models with effective
exploitation of varying cross-embodiment features. Our new X-VLA, a neat
flow-matching-based VLA architecture, relies exclusively on soft-prompted
standard Transformer encoders, enjoying both scalability and simplicity.
Evaluated across 6 simulations as well as 3 real-world robots, our 0.9B
instantiation-X-VLA-0.9B simultaneously achieves SOTA performance over a sweep
of benchmarks, demonstrating superior results on a wide axes of capabilities,
from flexible dexterity to quick adaptation across embodiments, environments,

Conclusion: The proposed deep reinforcement learning framework provides an effective solution for safe and precise maneuvering of complex non-holonomic robots in cluttered environments without requiring manual trajectory planning.

Abstract: We present a deep reinforcement learning framework based on Soft Actor-Critic
(SAC) for safe and precise maneuvering of double-Ackermann-steering mobile

differential-drive robots, DASMRs face strong kinematic constraints that make
classical planners brittle in cluttered environments. Our framework leverages
the Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) and the CrossQ overlay to encourage
maneuvering efficiency while avoiding obstacles. Simulation results with a
heavy four-wheel-steering rover show that the learned policy can robustly reach
up to 97% of target positions while avoiding obstacles. Our framework does not

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces the concept of "robochemist" - autonomous systems integrating robotics and AI to assist in chemical experiments, creating a symbiotic partnership between human chemists and automated systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chemistry has traditionally relied on manual processes that are time-consuming. The field needs evolution through automation to enhance discovery, improve reproducibility, and accelerate innovation in pharmaceuticals, materials science, and sustainable manufacturing.

Method: Integration of mobile manipulators, advanced perception, teleoperation, and data-driven protocols to create autonomous systems that can design, execute, and analyze chemical experiments with greater adaptability and safety.

Result: The robochemist concept enables more efficient exploration of chemical space, enhances reproducibility, and accelerates innovation while maintaining human oversight and collaboration.

Conclusion: The future of chemistry lies in a symbiotic partnership where human intuition and expertise is amplified by robotic precision and AI-driven insight, rather than full automation replacing human chemists.

Abstract: Chemistry, a long-standing discipline, has historically relied on manual and
often time-consuming processes. While some automation exists, the field is now
on the cusp of a significant evolution driven by the integration of robotics
and artificial intelligence (AI), giving rise to the concept of the
robochemist: a new paradigm where autonomous systems assist in designing,
executing, and analyzing experiments. Robochemists integrate mobile
manipulators, advanced perception, teleoperation, and data-driven protocols to
execute experiments with greater adaptability, reproducibility, and safety.
Rather than a fully automated replacement for human chemists, we envisioned the
robochemist as a complementary partner that works collaboratively to enhance
discovery, enabling a more efficient exploration of chemical space and
accelerating innovation in pharmaceuticals, materials science, and sustainable
manufacturing. This article traces the technologies, applications, and
challenges that define this transformation, highlighting both the opportunities
and the responsibilities that accompany the emergence of the robochemist.
Ultimately, the future of chemistry is argued to lie in a symbiotic partnership
where human intuition and expertise is amplified by robotic precision and
AI-driven insight.

*Yuxiang Peng,Chuchu Chen,Kejian Wu,Guoquan Huang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents sqrtVINS, an ultra-fast square-root filter-based visual-inertial navigation system that achieves superior numerical stability and operates at twice the speed of state-of-the-art methods, with robust dynamic initialization even in extreme conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Resource constraints and numerical instability on embedded robotic systems with limited precision remain critical challenges in visual-inertial navigation systems (VINS). Square-root covariance-based filters offer numerical stability and efficient memory usage but suffer from inefficiencies due to disruptions in triangular structure during updates.

Method: The proposed method uses a novel Cholesky decomposition (LLT)-based square-root filter update that fully exploits system structure to preserve triangular structure. It also includes a fast dynamic initialization method that first recovers minimal states without 3D feature triangulation, then performs iterative SRF update to refine full states.

Result: The LLT-based SRF demonstrates superior numerical stability and achieves robust efficient performance on 32-bit single-precision floats, operating at twice the speed of SOTA methods. Initialization achieves high success rate even within 100 ms window under minimal conditions on both mobile workstations and Jetson Nano computers.

Conclusion: sqrtVINS shows strong efficiency, robustness, and reliability across diverse scenarios, with full open-source implementation released to support future research and applications in visual-inertial navigation systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we develop and open-source, for the first time, a square-root
filter (SRF)-based visual-inertial navigation system (VINS), termed sqrtVINS,
which is ultra-fast, numerically stable, and capable of dynamic initialization
even under extreme conditions (i.e., extremely small time window). Despite
recent advancements in VINS, resource constraints and numerical instability on
embedded (robotic) systems with limited precision remain critical challenges. A
square-root covariance-based filter offers a promising solution by providing
numerical stability, efficient memory usage, and guaranteed positive
semi-definiteness. However, canonical SRFs suffer from inefficiencies caused by
disruptions in the triangular structure of the covariance matrix during
updates. The proposed method significantly improves VINS efficiency with a
novel Cholesky decomposition (LLT)-based SRF update, by fully exploiting the
system structure to preserve the structure. Moreover, we design a fast, robust,
dynamic initialization method, which first recovers the minimal states without
triangulating 3D features and then efficiently performs iterative SRF update to
refine the full states, enabling seamless VINS operation. The proposed
LLT-based SRF is extensively verified through numerical studies, demonstrating
superior numerical stability and achieving robust efficient performance on
32-bit single-precision floats, operating at twice the speed of
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Our initialization method, tested on both
mobile workstations and Jetson Nano computers, achieving a high success rate of
initialization even within a 100 ms window under minimal conditions. Finally,
the proposed sqrtVINS is extensively validated across diverse scenarios,
demonstrating strong efficiency, robustness, and reliability. The full
open-source implementation is released to support future research and
applications.

### [243] [Learning to Throw-Flip](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10357)
*Yang Liu,Bruno Da Costa,Aude Billard*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A robot throwing method that enables accurate "throw-flipping" of objects to desired landing positions and orientations by decoupling parasitic rotation and combining physics-based modeling with learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robot throwing methods focus only on landing location while ignoring orientation control, and conventional throwing suffers from parasitic rotation that restricts controllable landing poses.

Method: Leverages impulse-momentum principle to design throwing motions that decouple parasitic rotation, and combines physics-based free flight modeling with regression-based learning to handle unmodeled effects.

Result: Achieves throw-flipping accuracy within ±5 cm and ±45 degrees in dozens of trials, reduces sample complexity by 40% compared to end-to-end learning, and accelerates learning by 70% when reusing past knowledge for new objects.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enables robots to accurately throw-flip objects to desired poses while significantly improving learning efficiency and transferability across different objects.

Abstract: Dynamic manipulation, such as robot tossing or throwing objects, has recently
gained attention as a novel paradigm to speed up logistic operations. However,
the focus has predominantly been on the object's landing location, irrespective
of its final orientation. In this work, we present a method enabling a robot to
accurately "throw-flip" objects to a desired landing pose (position and
orientation). Conventionally, objects thrown by revolute robots suffer from
parasitic rotation, resulting in highly restricted and uncontrollable landing
poses. Our approach is based on two key design choices: first, leveraging the
impulse-momentum principle, we design a family of throwing motions that
effectively decouple the parasitic rotation, significantly expanding the
feasible set of landing poses. Second, we combine a physics-based model of free
flight with regression-based learning methods to account for unmodeled effects.
Real robot experiments demonstrate that our framework can learn to throw-flip
objects to a pose target within ($\pm$5 cm, $\pm$45 degrees) threshold in
dozens of trials. Thanks to data assimilation, incorporating projectile
dynamics reduces sample complexity by an average of 40% when throw-flipping to
unseen poses compared to end-to-end learning methods. Additionally, we show
that past knowledge on in-hand object spinning can be effectively reused,
accelerating learning by 70% when throwing a new object with a Center of Mass
(CoM) shift. A video summarizing the proposed method and the hardware
experiments is available at https://youtu.be/txYc9b1oflU.

### [246] [Hierarchical Planning for Long-Horizon Multi-Target Tracking Under Target Motion Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10421)
*Junbin Yuan,Brady Moon,Muqing Cao,Sebastian Scherer*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Hierarchical planner for multi-target tracking using aerial vehicles that decomposes tracking into search/detection sub-tasks, uses motion models and uncertainty propagation, and solves as MDP with tree-based algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-robot systems struggle with persistent multi-target tracking in large areas due to limited sensing capabilities and uncertainty accumulation when targets leave field of view. Existing approaches use short planning horizons and assume small environments, leading to poor performance and target loss.

Method: Hierarchical decomposition into single target search/detection sub-tasks; low-level coverage planner for searching in evolving belief areas; estimation method to assess sub-task success likelihood; conversion to Markov decision process solved with tree-based algorithm.

Result: Validated in simulation, outperforms existing planners with 11-70% reduction in final uncertainty across different environments.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical planner effectively addresses multi-target tracking challenges in large-scale scenarios by incorporating motion models, uncertainty propagation, and long-horizon planning through MDP formulation.

Abstract: Achieving persistent tracking of multiple dynamic targets over a large
spatial area poses significant challenges for a single-robot system with
constrained sensing capabilities. As the robot moves to track different
targets, the ones outside the field of view accumulate uncertainty, making them
progressively harder to track. An effective path planning algorithm must manage
uncertainty over a long horizon and account for the risk of permanently losing
track of targets that remain unseen for too long. However, most existing
approaches rely on short planning horizons and assume small, bounded
environments, resulting in poor tracking performance and target loss in
large-scale scenarios. In this paper, we present a hierarchical planner for
tracking multiple moving targets with an aerial vehicle. To address the
challenge of tracking non-static targets, our method incorporates motion models
and uncertainty propagation during path execution, allowing for more informed
decision-making. We decompose the multi-target tracking task into sub-tasks of
single target search and detection, and our proposed pipeline consists a novel
low-level coverage planner that enables searching for a target in an evolving
belief area, and an estimation method to assess the likelihood of success for
each sub-task, making it possible to convert the active target tracking task to
a Markov decision process (MDP) that we solve with a tree-based algorithm to
determine the sequence of sub-tasks. We validate our approach in simulation,
demonstrating its effectiveness compared to existing planners for active target
tracking tasks, and our proposed planner outperforms existing approaches,
achieving a reduction of 11-70% in final uncertainty across different
environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning framework that generates versatile quadrupedal gaits using symmetry principles, eliminating the need for predefined trajectories and enabling smooth transitions between different locomotion patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for generating specific footfall sequences in quadrupedal robots require laborious expert tuning of numerous variables like touch-down/lift-off events and holonomic constraints for each leg.

Method: Proposes a symmetry-guided reward function design incorporating temporal, morphological, and time-reversal symmetries, leveraging intrinsic symmetries and velocity-period relationship of dynamic legged systems.

Result: Implemented on Unitree Go2 robot, demonstrating robust performance across speed ranges in simulations and hardware tests, with improved gait adaptability without extensive reward tuning or explicit foot placement control.

Conclusion: The work provides insights into dynamic locomotion strategies and underscores the crucial role of symmetries in robotic gait design, enabling versatile gait generation through natural dynamics.

Abstract: Quadrupedal robots exhibit a wide range of viable gaits, but generating
specific footfall sequences often requires laborious expert tuning of numerous
variables, such as touch-down and lift-off events and holonomic constraints for
each leg. This paper presents a unified reinforcement learning framework for
generating versatile quadrupedal gaits by leveraging the intrinsic symmetries
and velocity-period relationship of dynamic legged systems. We propose a
symmetry-guided reward function design that incorporates temporal,
morphological, and time-reversal symmetries. By focusing on preserved
symmetries and natural dynamics, our approach eliminates the need for
predefined trajectories, enabling smooth transitions between diverse locomotion
patterns such as trotting, bounding, half-bounding, and galloping. Implemented
on the Unitree Go2 robot, our method demonstrates robust performance across a
range of speeds in both simulations and hardware tests, significantly improving
gait adaptability without extensive reward tuning or explicit foot placement
control. This work provides insights into dynamic locomotion strategies and
underscores the crucial role of symmetries in robotic gait design.

*Robert Mahony,Jonathan Kelly,Stephan Weiss*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces Galilean symmetry to robotics, presenting it as a matrix Lie group that can describe two pose representations (Galilean frames and extended poses) and demonstrating its application to inertial navigation, manipulator kinematics, and sensor fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Galilean symmetry underpins Newtonian physics but lacks a robotics-focused treatment, unlike the well-established rigid-body symmetry. The paper aims to bridge this gap by leveraging the robotics community's familiarity with pose representations.

Method: The authors present Galilean symmetry as a matrix Lie group that can describe two different pose representations: Galilean frames (using inertial velocity) and extended poses (using coordinate velocity). They contrast this with physics literature approaches that treat it as a stepping stone to relativity.

Result: The paper demonstrates three applications where Galilean matrix Lie-group algebra provides straightforward solutions and significant insights: inertial navigation above rotating Earth, manipulator kinematics, and sensor data fusion under temporal uncertainty.

Conclusion: The time is right for the robotics community to benefit from rediscovering and extending Galilean symmetry, applying this classical material to modern robotics problems with straightforward implementation and valuable insights.

Abstract: Galilean symmetry is the natural symmetry of inertial motion that underpins
Newtonian physics. Although rigid-body symmetry is one of the most established
and fundamental tools in robotics, there appears to be no comparable treatment
of Galilean symmetry for a robotics audience. In this paper, we present a
robotics-tailored exposition of Galilean symmetry that leverages the
community's familiarity with and understanding of rigid-body transformations
and pose representations. Our approach contrasts with common treatments in the
physics literature that introduce Galilean symmetry as a stepping stone to
Einstein's relativity. A key insight is that the Galilean matrix Lie group can
be used to describe two different pose representations, Galilean frames, that
use inertial velocity in the state definition, and extended poses, that use
coordinate velocity. We provide three examples where applying the Galilean
matrix Lie-group algebra to robotics problems is straightforward and yields
significant insights: inertial navigation above the rotating Earth, manipulator
kinematics, and sensor data fusion under temporal uncertainty. We believe that
the time is right for the robotics community to benefit from rediscovering and
extending this classical material and applying it to modern problems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SuperEx integrates non-line-of-sight (NLOS) sensing into robotic exploration using single-photon LiDARs to detect hidden objects, improving mapping accuracy by 12% and exploration efficiency compared to line-of-sight methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robot perception is limited to line-of-sight, making occluded regions unknown until physically traversed, which leads to inefficient exploration when environments deviate from assumptions.

Method: Uses single-photon LiDARs to capture time-of-flight histograms that encode hidden objects. SuperEx framework carves empty NLOS regions from timing histograms and reconstructs occupied structure via physics-based and data-driven approaches leveraging structural regularities.

Result: 12% gain in mapping accuracy under <30% coverage and improved exploration efficiency compared to line-of-sight baselines in simulated and real-world KTH Floorplan dataset evaluations.

Conclusion: SuperEx enables reliable mapping beyond direct visibility by integrating NLOS sensing into the exploration-mapping loop, opening new possibilities for efficient robotic exploration.

Abstract: Efficient exploration and mapping in unknown indoor environments is a
fundamental challenge, with high stakes in time-critical settings. In current
systems, robot perception remains confined to line-of-sight; occluded regions
remain unknown until physically traversed, leading to inefficient exploration
when layouts deviate from prior assumptions. In this work, we bring
non-line-of-sight (NLOS) sensing to robotic exploration. We leverage
single-photon LiDARs, which capture time-of-flight histograms that encode the
presence of hidden objects - allowing robots to look around blind corners.
Recent single-photon LiDARs have become practical and portable, enabling
deployment beyond controlled lab settings. Prior NLOS works target 3D
reconstruction in static, lab-based scenarios, and initial efforts toward
NLOS-aided navigation consider simplified geometries. We introduce SuperEx, a
framework that integrates NLOS sensing directly into the mapping-exploration
loop. SuperEx augments global map prediction with beyond-line-of-sight cues by
(i) carving empty NLOS regions from timing histograms and (ii) reconstructing
occupied structure via a two-step physics-based and data-driven approach that
leverages structural regularities. Evaluations on complex simulated maps and
the real-world KTH Floorplan dataset show a 12% gain in mapping accuracy under
< 30% coverage and improved exploration efficiency compared to line-of-sight
baselines, opening a path to reliable mapping beyond direct visibility.

Result: The proposed method enables manipulators with different structures to work together effectively while allowing intuitive human control through adjustable dynamics.

Conclusion: The 4-channel bilateral control method successfully achieves dimension decoupling in Cartesian coordinates, providing improved operability for remote control tasks regardless of scaling factors.

Abstract: Four-channel bilateral control is a method for achieving remote control with
force feedback and adjustment operability by synchronizing the positions and
forces of two manipulators. This is expected to significantly improve the
operability of the remote control in contact-rich tasks. Among these, 4-channel
bilateral control on the Cartesian coordinate system is advantageous owing to
its suitability for manipulators with different structures and because it
allows the dynamics in the Cartesian coordinate system to be adjusted by
adjusting the control parameters, thus achieving intuitive operability for
humans. This paper proposes a 4-channel bilateral control method that achieves
the desired dynamics by decoupling each dimension in the Cartesian coordinate

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RL agent dynamically switches cost function parameters of trajectory planner for autonomous racing, achieving 0% collision rate and 60% faster overtaking compared to static planners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static cost function weights in sampling-based trajectory planners force suboptimal tactical compromises across diverse racing scenarios, limiting adaptability.

Method: Use Reinforcement Learning as high-level behavioral selector to dynamically switch cost function parameters of analytical low-level trajectory planner during runtime.

Result: Achieved 0% collision rate while reducing overtaking time by up to 60% compared to state-of-the-art static planners, enabling interactive maneuvers unattainable with static configurations.

Conclusion: Integrating RL as high-level selector resolves trade-off between safety and competitiveness in autonomous racing, offering pathway toward adaptive yet interpretable motion planning for broader autonomous driving.

Abstract: Sampling-based trajectory planners are widely used for agile autonomous
driving due to their ability to generate fast, smooth, and kinodynamically
feasible trajectories. However, their behavior is often governed by a cost
function with manually tuned, static weights, which forces a tactical
compromise that is suboptimal across the wide range of scenarios encountered in
a race. To address this shortcoming, we propose using a Reinforcement Learning
(RL) agent as a high-level behavioral selector that dynamically switches the
cost function parameters of an analytical, low-level trajectory planner during
runtime. We show the effectiveness of our approach in simulation in an
autonomous racing environment where our RL-based planner achieved 0% collision
rate while reducing overtaking time by up to 60% compared to state-of-the-art
static planners. Our new agent now dynamically switches between aggressive and
conservative behaviors, enabling interactive maneuvers unattainable with static
configurations. These results demonstrate that integrating reinforcement
learning as a high-level selector resolves the inherent trade-off between
safety and competitiveness in autonomous racing planners. The proposed
methodology offers a pathway toward adaptive yet interpretable motion planning

Abstract: Improving robotic navigation is critical for extending exploration range and
enhancing operational efficiency. Vision-based navigation relying on
traditional CCD or CMOS cameras faces major challenges when complex
illumination conditions are paired with motion, limiting the range and
accessibility of mobile planetary robots. In this study, we propose a novel
approach to planetary navigation that leverages the unique imaging capabilities
of Single-Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) cameras. We present the first
comprehensive evaluation of single-photon imaging as an alternative passive
sensing technology for robotic exploration missions targeting perceptually
challenging locations, with a special emphasis on high-latitude lunar regions.
We detail the operating principles and performance characteristics of SPAD
cameras, assess their advantages and limitations in addressing key perception
challenges of upcoming exploration missions to the Moon, and benchmark their
performance under representative illumination conditions.

*Zhuoheng Gao,Jiyao Zhang,Zhiyong Xie,Hao Dong,Zhaofei Yu,Rongmei Chen,Guozhang Chen,Tiejun Huang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SpikeGrasp is a neuro-inspired 6-DoF grasp detection framework that processes raw stereo spike camera events directly to infer grasp poses, eliminating the need for 3D point cloud reconstruction and outperforming traditional methods in cluttered scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional robotic grasping systems rely on converting sensor data to explicit 3D point clouds, which is computationally intensive and not biologically inspired. The authors aim to develop a more efficient, neuro-inspired approach that mimics biological visuomotor pathways.

Method: The framework processes raw asynchronous events from stereo spike cameras (similar to retinas) and uses a recurrent spiking neural network to iteratively refine grasp hypotheses without reconstructing point clouds. A large-scale synthetic benchmark dataset was created for validation.

Result: SpikeGrasp surpasses traditional point-cloud-based baselines, particularly in cluttered and textureless scenes, and demonstrates remarkable data efficiency.

Conclusion: SpikeGrasp establishes the viability of end-to-end neuro-inspired approaches for robotic grasping, paving the way for more fluid and efficient manipulation systems, especially for dynamic objects.

Abstract: Most robotic grasping systems rely on converting sensor data into explicit 3D
point clouds, which is a computational step not found in biological
intelligence. This paper explores a fundamentally different, neuro-inspired
paradigm for 6-DoF grasp detection. We introduce SpikeGrasp, a framework that
mimics the biological visuomotor pathway, processing raw, asynchronous events
from stereo spike cameras, similarly to retinas, to directly infer grasp poses.
Our model fuses these stereo spike streams and uses a recurrent spiking neural
network, analogous to high-level visual processing, to iteratively refine grasp
hypotheses without ever reconstructing a point cloud. To validate this
approach, we built a large-scale synthetic benchmark dataset. Experiments show
that SpikeGrasp surpasses traditional point-cloud-based baselines, especially
in cluttered and textureless scenes, and demonstrates remarkable data
efficiency. By establishing the viability of this end-to-end, neuro-inspired
approach, SpikeGrasp paves the way for future systems capable of the fluid and
efficient manipulation seen in nature, particularly for dynamic objects.

*Haoyu Zhao,Cheng Zeng,Linghao Zhuang,Yaxi Zhao,Shengke Xue,Hao Wang,Xingyue Zhao,Zhongyu Li,Kehan Li,Siteng Huang,Mingxiu Chen,Xin Li,Deli Zhao,Hua Zou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoboSimGS is a Real2Sim2Real framework that converts real-world images into high-fidelity simulation environments using 3D Gaussian Splatting for photorealism and mesh primitives for physics, with MLLM automation for physical properties and kinematics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the scalability bottleneck in robotic learning caused by expensive real-world data collection and the sim-to-real gap in simulated data.

Method: Uses hybrid representation with 3DGS for visual appearance and mesh primitives for physics simulation, plus MLLM to automatically infer physical properties and kinematic structures from visual data.

Result: Policies trained entirely on RoboSimGS data achieve successful zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and enhance performance of state-of-the-art methods across diverse manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: RoboSimGS provides a powerful and scalable solution for bridging the sim-to-real gap in robotic manipulation.

Abstract: The scalability of robotic learning is fundamentally bottlenecked by the
significant cost and labor of real-world data collection. While simulated data
offers a scalable alternative, it often fails to generalize to the real world
due to significant gaps in visual appearance, physical properties, and object
interactions. To address this, we propose RoboSimGS, a novel Real2Sim2Real
framework that converts multi-view real-world images into scalable,
high-fidelity, and physically interactive simulation environments for robotic
manipulation. Our approach reconstructs scenes using a hybrid representation:
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) captures the photorealistic appearance of the
environment, while mesh primitives for interactive objects ensure accurate
physics simulation. Crucially, we pioneer the use of a Multi-modal Large
Language Model (MLLM) to automate the creation of physically plausible,
articulated assets. The MLLM analyzes visual data to infer not only physical
properties (e.g., density, stiffness) but also complex kinematic structures
(e.g., hinges, sliding rails) of objects. We demonstrate that policies trained
entirely on data generated by RoboSimGS achieve successful zero-shot
sim-to-real transfer across a diverse set of real-world manipulation tasks.
Furthermore, data from RoboSimGS significantly enhances the performance and
generalization capabilities of SOTA methods. Our results validate RoboSimGS as
a powerful and scalable solution for bridging the sim-to-real gap.

*Jianke Zhang,Yucheng Hu,Yanjiang Guo,Xiaoyu Chen,Yichen Liu,Wenna Chen,Chaochao Lu,Jianyu Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: UniCoD is a unified robot policy that combines vision-language understanding and visual generation capabilities through large-scale pretraining on instructional videos, enabling better performance in diverse robotic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generalist robot policies either use vision-language models or generative models, but both semantic understanding and visual dynamics modeling are crucial for embodied robots. Unified models that combine comprehension and generation have shown strong capabilities.

Method: UniCoD is pretrained on over 1M internet-scale instructional manipulation videos to model high-dimensional visual features, then fine-tuned on robot embodiment data to learn mappings from predictive representations to action tokens.

Result: Extensive experiments show UniCoD consistently outperforms baseline methods by 9% in simulation environments and 12% in real-world out-of-distribution tasks.

Conclusion: Robotic policy learning benefits from combining understanding, planning and continuous future representation learning through unified pretraining approaches like UniCoD.

Abstract: Building generalist robot policies that can handle diverse tasks in
open-ended environments is a central challenge in robotics. To leverage
knowledge from large-scale pretraining, prior work has typically built
generalist policies either on top of vision-language understanding models
(VLMs) or generative models. However, both semantic understanding from
vision-language pretraining and visual dynamics modeling from visual-generation
pretraining are crucial for embodied robots. Recent unified models of
generation and understanding have demonstrated strong capabilities in both
comprehension and generation through large-scale pretraining. We posit that
robotic policy learning can likewise benefit from the combined strengths of
understanding, planning and continuous future representation learning. Building
on this insight, we introduce UniCoD, which acquires the ability to dynamically
model high-dimensional visual features through pretraining on over 1M
internet-scale instructional manipulation videos. Subsequently, UniCoD is
fine-tuned on data collected from the robot embodiment, enabling the learning
of mappings from predictive representations to action tokens. Extensive
experiments show our approach consistently outperforms baseline methods in
terms of 9\% and 12\% across simulation environments and real-world
out-of-distribution tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To replace legacy MC architecture with a unified system that combines understandable symbolic reasoning with machine learning for practical oceanographic applications.

Method: Built from ground-up in Python3 as an extensible, modular system supporting declarative mission specification and flexible behavior specification using both real-time task planning and hard-coded plans.

Result: Successfully demonstrated in field tests on AUV Sentry and various simulated cases, showing practical implementation of the unified architecture.

Conclusion: DINOS-R provides a reusable, extensible platform for AUV mission planning that bridges symbolic AI and machine learning, with potential for future oceanography and robotics research.

Abstract: A new AUV mission planning and execution software has been tested on AUV
Sentry. Dubbed DINOS-R, it draws inspiration from cognitive architectures and
AUV control systems to replace the legacy MC architecture. Unlike these
existing architectures, however, DINOS-R is built from the ground-up to unify
symbolic decision making (for understandable, repeatable, provable behavior)
with machine learning techniques and reactive behaviors, for field-readiness
across oceanographic platforms. Implemented primarily in Python3, DINOS-R is
extensible, modular, and reusable, with an emphasis on non-expert use as well
as growth for future research in oceanography and robot algorithms. Mission
specification is flexible, and can be specified declaratively. Behavior
specification is similarly flexible, supporting simultaneous use of real-time
task planning and hard-coded user specified plans. These features were
demonstrated in the field on Sentry, in addition to a variety of simulated
cases. These results are discussed, and future work is outlined.

*Yongxi Cao,Julian F. Schumann,Jens Kober,Joni Pajarinen,Arkady Zgonnikov*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PrefCVAE is an augmented conditional variational autoencoder framework that uses preference pairs to enable controllable, semantically diverse trajectory predictions for autonomous vehicles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing trajectory prediction models lack controllably diverse generation, which is crucial for safe autonomous vehicle planning since human behaviors are inherently multimodal and uncertain.

Method: Augmented CVAE framework using weakly labeled preference pairs to imbue latent variables with semantic attributes (e.g., average velocity), enabling controllable trajectory generation.

Result: PrefCVAE achieves controllable, semantically meaningful predictions without degrading baseline accuracy, demonstrating effectiveness of preference supervision as a cost-effective enhancement.

Conclusion: Preference supervision provides a practical way to enhance generative models for controllable diversity in trajectory prediction, addressing the need for safer autonomous vehicle planning.

Abstract: Deep generative models such as conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs)
have shown great promise for predicting trajectories of surrounding agents in
autonomous vehicle planning. State-of-the-art models have achieved remarkable
accuracy in such prediction tasks. Besides accuracy, diversity is also crucial
for safe planning because human behaviors are inherently uncertain and
multimodal. However, existing methods generally lack a scheme to generate
controllably diverse trajectories, which is arguably more useful than randomly
diversified trajectories, to the end of safe planning. To address this, we
propose PrefCVAE, an augmented CVAE framework that uses weakly labeled
preference pairs to imbue latent variables with semantic attributes. Using
average velocity as an example attribute, we demonstrate that PrefCVAE enables
controllable, semantically meaningful predictions without degrading baseline
accuracy. Our results show the effectiveness of preference supervision as a
cost-effective way to enhance sampling-based generative models.

### [259] [Gain Tuning Is Not What You Need: Reward Gain Adaptation for Constrained Locomotion Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10759)
*Arthicha Srisuchinnawong,Poramate Manoonpong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ROGER is a method that adapts reward-weighting gains online during robot locomotion learning to ensure constraint satisfaction while maximizing performance, achieving near-zero constraint violations and up to 50% higher rewards than state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robot locomotion learning techniques cannot guarantee constraint satisfaction during training and rely heavily on manual reward weighting gain selection, which limits their practical application in real-world scenarios.

Method: ROGER adapts reward-weighting gains online based on penalties received during embodied interaction. It automatically reduces the ratio between positive and negative reward gains when approaching constraint thresholds to avoid violations, and increases the ratio in safe states to prioritize performance.

Result: ROGER achieved near-zero constraint violation throughout multiple learning trials with a 60-kg quadruped robot, up to 50% more primary reward than state-of-the-art techniques, and comparable or up to 100% higher performance with 60% less torque usage and orientation deviation in MuJoCo benchmarks. Real-world locomotion learning was achieved from scratch within one hour without any falls.

Conclusion: ROGER contributes to constraint-satisfying real-world continual robot locomotion learning and simplifies reward weighting gain tuning, facilitating the development of physical robots that can learn directly in the real world.

Abstract: Existing robot locomotion learning techniques rely heavily on the offline
selection of proper reward weighting gains and cannot guarantee constraint
satisfaction (i.e., constraint violation) during training. Thus, this work aims
to address both issues by proposing Reward-Oriented Gains via Embodied
Regulation (ROGER), which adapts reward-weighting gains online based on
penalties received throughout the embodied interaction process. The ratio
between the positive reward (primary reward) and negative reward (penalty)
gains is automatically reduced as the learning approaches the constraint
thresholds to avoid violation. Conversely, the ratio is increased when learning
is in safe states to prioritize performance. With a 60-kg quadruped robot,
ROGER achieved near-zero constraint violation throughout multiple learning
trials. It also achieved up to 50% more primary reward than the equivalent
state-of-the-art techniques. In MuJoCo continuous locomotion benchmarks,
including a single-leg hopper, ROGER exhibited comparable or up to 100% higher
performance and 60% less torque usage and orientation deviation compared to
those trained with the default reward function. Finally, real-world locomotion
learning of a physical quadruped robot was achieved from scratch within one
hour without any falls. Therefore, this work contributes to
constraint-satisfying real-world continual robot locomotion learning and
simplifies reward weighting gain tuning, potentially facilitating the
development of physical robots and those that learn in the real world.

*Christopher D. Hsu,Pratik Chaudhari*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Universal Scene Description (USD) as a general representation for LLM-based robotics tasks, demonstrating a system that builds USD representations from real-world sensor data and uses LLMs for scene understanding and planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for using LLMs in robotics are task-specific (e.g., navigation, mapping). The authors argue that USD provides a universal, human- and LLM-readable representation that can support essentially any robotics task.

Method: Developed a "Real to USD" system using a quadruped robot with LiDAR and RGB camera to build explicit USD representations of indoor environments. Used Google's Gemini to parse USD for scene understanding, complex inferences, and planning. Also studied the system in simulated warehouse and hospital settings using Nvidia's Isaac Sim.

Result: Successfully demonstrated that USD can effectively represent geometric, photometric and semantic information for LLM-based robotics tasks. The system can handle diverse objects and challenging settings including environments with lots of glass.

Conclusion: USD is an effective and general representation for LLM-based robotics tasks, providing a universal scene description language that bridges the gap between classical robot environment representations and natural language-based priors needed for LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can help robots reason about abstract task
specifications. This requires augmenting classical representations of the
environment used by robots with natural language-based priors. There are a
number of existing approaches to doing so, but they are tailored to specific
tasks, e.g., visual-language models for navigation, language-guided neural
radiance fields for mapping, etc. This paper argues that the Universal Scene
Description (USD) language is an effective and general representation of
geometric, photometric and semantic information in the environment for
LLM-based robotics tasks. Our argument is simple: a USD is an XML-based scene
graph, readable by LLMs and humans alike, and rich enough to support
essentially any task -- Pixar developed this language to store assets, scenes
and even movies. We demonstrate a ``Real to USD'' system using a Unitree Go2
quadruped robot carrying LiDAR and a RGB camera that (i) builds an explicit USD
representation of indoor environments with diverse objects and challenging
settings with lots of glass, and (ii) parses the USD using Google's Gemini to
demonstrate scene understanding, complex inferences, and planning. We also
study different aspects of this system in simulated warehouse and hospital
settings using Nvidia's Issac Sim. Code is available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A two-layer Voronoi coverage control method for hybrid aerial-ground robot teams that addresses limitations of traditional Voronoi coverage in emergency response scenarios, achieving 88% faster response time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Voronoi coverage control methods have limitations in emergency contexts: heterogeneous agent capabilities with different velocities, clustered initial deployments, and urgent time constraints requiring rapid response rather than eventual convergence.

Method: Decoupled two-layer architecture that separately optimizes aerial and ground robot positioning, with aerial agents delivering ground sensors via airdrop to high-priority locations. Includes bounded Voronoi cell computation, efficient numerical integration for importance-weighted centroids, and robust control strategies to prevent agent trapping.

Result: 88% reduction in response time, achieving target sensor coverage (18.5% of initial sensor loss) in 25 seconds compared to 220 seconds for ground-only deployment.

Conclusion: The two-layer Voronoi coverage control approach effectively addresses emergency response challenges and significantly improves deployment speed for hybrid aerial-ground robot teams in hazardous material scenarios.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive two-layer Voronoi coverage control approach for
coordinating hybrid aerial-ground robot teams in hazardous material emergency
response scenarios. Traditional Voronoi coverage control methods face three
critical limitations in emergency contexts: heterogeneous agent capabilities
with vastly different velocities, clustered initial deployment configurations,
and urgent time constraints requiring rapid response rather than eventual
convergence. Our method addresses these challenges through a decoupled
two-layer architecture that separately optimizes aerial and ground robot
positioning, with aerial agents delivering ground sensors via airdrop to
high-priority locations. We provide detailed implementation of bounded Voronoi
cell computation, efficient numerical integration techniques for
importance-weighted centroids, and robust control strategies that prevent agent
trapping. Simulation results demonstrate an 88% reduction in response time,
achieving target sensor coverage (18.5% of initial sensor loss) in 25 seconds
compared to 220 seconds for ground-only deployment. Complete implementation

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This survey paper analyzes tactile data representation in robotic perception, identifying six common data structures and providing guidelines for selecting appropriate representations based on hardware, required information, and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tactile perception requires transforming sensor data into structured formats for high-level computation, but this transformation affects information encoding and task execution. Existing techniques from domains like computer vision expect properly structured input data.

Method: The paper reviews previous studies on tactile information representation, investigating relationships among hardware, representations, and high-level computation methods. It identifies six common data structures used in the literature.

Result: The analysis identified six structures commonly used to represent tactile data. The paper provides discussions and guidelines for selecting appropriate representations based on operating conditions.

Conclusion: Proper selection of tactile data representation is crucial and should consider available hardware, required tactile information, and the specific task at hand, as the representation directly affects information encoding and task execution.

Abstract: Robotic tactile perception is a complex process involving several
computational steps performed at different levels. Tactile information is
shaped by the interplay of robot actions, the mechanical properties of its
body, and the software that processes the data. In this respect, high-level
computation, required to process and extract information, is commonly performed
by adapting existing techniques from other domains, such as computer vision,
which expects input data to be properly structured. Therefore, it is necessary
to transform tactile sensor data to match a specific data structure. This
operation directly affects the tactile information encoded and, as a
consequence, the task execution. This survey aims to address this specific
aspect of the tactile perception pipeline, namely Data Representation. The
paper first clearly defines its contributions to the perception pipeline and
then reviews how previous studies have dealt with the problem of representing
tactile information, investigating the relationships among hardware,
representations, and high-level computation methods. The analysis has led to
the identification of six structures commonly used in the literature to
represent data. The manuscript provides discussions and guidelines for properly
selecting a representation depending on operating conditions, including the
available hardware, the tactile information required to be encoded, and the
task at hand.

TL;DR: A method for detecting and localizing contact along robot legs using distributed joint torque sensors and a single hip-mounted force-torque sensor through a generalized momentum-based observer framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable accurate contact detection and localization along robot legs without complex friction models, using direct torque measurements for more precise readings than motor current-based estimation.

Method: Developed low-cost strain-gauge-based joint torque sensors for every joint, combined with a single hip-mounted FT sensor in a generalized momentum-based observer framework. Validated through simulation on a 2-DoF robot leg and hardware experiments on a 2-DoF manipulator.

Result: Simulation verified accurate recovery of contact force and location along thigh and shin links. Torque sensors achieved 96.4% accuracy relative to ground truth. Hardware experiments showed sub-centimeter contact localization accuracy and force errors below 0.2 N.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enables precise contact detection and localization along robot legs using distributed joint torque sensors, achieving high accuracy in both force measurement and contact position estimation.

Abstract: This paper presents a method for detecting and localizing contact along robot
legs using distributed joint torque sensors and a single hip-mounted
force-torque (FT) sensor using a generalized momentum-based observer framework.
We designed a low-cost strain-gauge-based joint torque sensor that can be
installed on every joint to provide direct torque measurements, eliminating the
need for complex friction models and providing more accurate torque readings
than estimation based on motor current. Simulation studies on a floating-based
2-DoF robot leg verified that the proposed framework accurately recovers
contact force and location along the thigh and shin links. Through a
calibration procedure, our torque sensor achieved an average 96.4% accuracy
relative to ground truth measurements. Building upon the torque sensor, we
performed hardware experiments on a 2-DoF manipulator, which showed
sub-centimeter contact localization accuracy and force errors below 0.2 N.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A multi-objective RL framework for humanoid locomotion that balances command tracking with compliance to external forces, enabling preference-conditioned behaviors in a single policy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL approaches for humanoid locomotion focus mainly on robustness and resist external forces, lacking compliance which is crucial for human interaction and challenging for inherently unstable humanoids.

Method: Preference-conditioned multi-objective RL framework that integrates rigid command following and compliant behaviors, models external forces via velocity-resistance factor, and uses encoder-decoder structure to infer privileged features from deployable observations.

Result: The framework improves adaptability and convergence over standard pipelines, and successfully realizes deployable preference-conditioned humanoid locomotion in both simulation and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-objective RL approach effectively balances command tracking and force compliance, enabling more adaptable and deployable humanoid locomotion policies suitable for human interaction scenarios.

Abstract: Humanoid locomotion requires not only accurate command tracking for
navigation but also compliant responses to external forces during human
interaction. Despite significant progress, existing RL approaches mainly
emphasize robustness, yielding policies that resist external forces but lack
compliance-particularly challenging for inherently unstable humanoids. In this
work, we address this by formulating humanoid locomotion as a multi-objective
optimization problem that balances command tracking and external force
compliance. We introduce a preference-conditioned multi-objective RL (MORL)
framework that integrates rigid command following and compliant behaviors
within a single omnidirectional locomotion policy. External forces are modeled
via velocity-resistance factor for consistent reward design, and training
leverages an encoder-decoder structure that infers task-relevant privileged
features from deployable observations. We validate our approach in both
simulation and real-world experiments on a humanoid robot. Experimental results
indicate that our framework not only improves adaptability and convergence over
standard pipelines, but also realizes deployable preference-conditioned
humanoid locomotion.

*Ahmed Alanazi,Duy Ho,Yugyung Lee*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GRIP is a unified framework for robot navigation that integrates perception, symbolic reasoning, and spatial planning through dynamic grid construction and three scalable variants optimized for different scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robot navigation methods rely on static priors or limited memory, which constrains adaptability under partial observability and semantic ambiguity in dynamic, cluttered environments.

Method: GRIP uses dynamic 2D grid construction with open-vocabulary object grounding, co-occurrence-aware symbolic planning, and hybrid policy execution combining behavioral cloning, D* search, and grid-conditioned control. It offers three variants: GRIP-L for lightweight symbolic navigation, GRIP-F with multi-hop anchor chaining and LLM-based introspection, and GRIP-R for real-world deployment.

Result: GRIP achieves up to 9.6% higher success rates and over 2× improvement in path efficiency (SPL and SAE) on long-horizon tasks in AI2-THOR and RoboTHOR benchmarks. Real-world deployment on Jetbot validates generalization under sensor noise and environmental variation.

Conclusion: GRIP is a robust, scalable, and explainable framework that effectively bridges simulation and real-world navigation through interpretable symbolic planning and modular design.

Abstract: Robots navigating dynamic, cluttered, and semantically complex environments
must integrate perception, symbolic reasoning, and spatial planning to
generalize across diverse layouts and object categories. Existing methods often
rely on static priors or limited memory, constraining adaptability under
partial observability and semantic ambiguity. We present GRIP, Grid-based Relay
with Intermediate Planning, a unified, modular framework with three scalable
variants: GRIP-L (Lightweight), optimized for symbolic navigation via semantic
occupancy grids; GRIP-F (Full), supporting multi-hop anchor chaining and
LLM-based introspection; and GRIP-R (Real-World), enabling physical robot
deployment under perceptual uncertainty. GRIP integrates dynamic 2D grid
construction, open-vocabulary object grounding, co-occurrence-aware symbolic
planning, and hybrid policy execution using behavioral cloning, D* search, and
grid-conditioned control. Empirical results on AI2-THOR and RoboTHOR benchmarks
show that GRIP achieves up to 9.6% higher success rates and over $2\times$
improvement in path efficiency (SPL and SAE) on long-horizon tasks. Qualitative
analyses reveal interpretable symbolic plans in ambiguous scenes. Real-world
deployment on a Jetbot further validates GRIP's generalization under sensor
noise and environmental variation. These results position GRIP as a robust,
scalable, and explainable framework bridging simulation and real-world
navigation.

*Yashom Dighe,Youngjin Kim,Karthik Dantu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces QuayPoints to preserve global optimality information in autonomous racing pipelines, enabling local planners to make better decisions during overtaking maneuvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard autonomy pipelines lose global racing context when propagating information downstream, particularly reducing optimality understanding to sparse waypoints that limit local planner decision-making.

Method: A framework that preserves essential global knowledge and conveys it to local planner through QuayPoints - regions where deviations from optimal raceline significantly compromise optimality.

Result: Integration of QuayPoints into existing planner enables consistent overtaking of opponents traveling at up to 75% of ego vehicle's speed across four distinct race tracks.

Conclusion: QuayPoints effectively bridge the gap between global and local planning by preserving time-optimality information, improving autonomous racing performance during strategic maneuvers like overtaking.

Abstract: Autonomous racing requires tight integration between perception, planning and
control to minimize latency as well as timely decision making. A standard
autonomy pipeline comprising a global planner, local planner, and controller
loses information as the higher-level racing context is sequentially propagated
downstream into specific task-oriented context. In particular, the global
planner's understanding of optimality is typically reduced to a sparse set of
waypoints, leaving the local planner to make reactive decisions with limited
context. This paper investigates whether additional global insights,
specifically time-optimality information, can be meaningfully passed to the
local planner to improve downstream decisions. We introduce a framework that
preserves essential global knowledge and conveys it to the local planner
through QuayPoints regions where deviations from the optimal raceline result in
significant compromises to optimality. QuayPoints enable local planners to make
more informed global decisions when deviating from the raceline, such as during
strategic overtaking. To demonstrate this, we integrate QuayPoints into an
existing planner and show that it consistently overtakes opponents traveling at
up to 75% of the ego vehicle's speed across four distinct race tracks.

*Dikshant Shehmar,Matthew E. Taylor,Ehsan Hashemi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes an adaptive transition strategy for autonomous driving systems that dynamically adjusts control authority based on driver's real-time tracking performance, improving takeover safety and reducing driver effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fixed time-based takeover strategies don't account for real-time driver performance variations, leading to reduced driver readiness and increased reaction times in out-of-the-loop circumstances.

Method: Models shared control as a cooperative differential game with time-varying objective functions, introduces driver-specific state-tracking matrix, and uses cumulative trajectory error metric to evaluate multiple transition strategies.

Result: Adaptive transitions reduce trajectory deviations and driver control effort compared to conventional strategies, enhance vehicle stability, and reduce driver effort during takeover.

Conclusion: Continuously adjusting control authority based on real-time deviations provides more natural takeover and improves overall system performance in autonomous driving transitions.

Abstract: The transition of control from autonomous systems to human drivers is
critical in automated driving systems, particularly due to the out-of-the-loop
(OOTL) circumstances that reduce driver readiness and increase reaction times.
Existing takeover strategies are based on fixed time-based transitions, which
fail to account for real-time driver performance variations. This paper
proposes an adaptive transition strategy that dynamically adjusts the control
authority based on both the time and tracking ability of the driver trajectory.
Shared control is modeled as a cooperative differential game, where control
authority is modulated through time-varying objective functions instead of
blending control torques directly. To ensure a more natural takeover, a
driver-specific state-tracking matrix is introduced, allowing the transition to
align with individual control preferences. Multiple transition strategies are
evaluated using a cumulative trajectory error metric. Human-in-the-loop control
scenarios of the standardized ISO lane change maneuvers demonstrate that
adaptive transitions reduce trajectory deviations and driver control effort
compared to conventional strategies. Experiments also confirm that continuously
adjusting control authority based on real-time deviations enhances vehicle
stability while reducing driver effort during takeover.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes GTR2L - a game-theoretic risk-shaped RL framework for autonomous driving that integrates multi-level game theory, adaptive rollout horizons, and uncertainty-aware safety mechanisms to improve safety and performance in complex traffic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL methods struggle to balance safety, efficiency, and adaptability in autonomous driving, as they focus primarily on reward maximization without explicit risk modeling or safety constraints in dynamic, interactive traffic scenarios.

Method: GTR2L incorporates: 1) multi-level game-theoretic world model for predicting interactive behaviors and risks, 2) adaptive rollout horizon based on predictive uncertainty, 3) uncertainty-aware barrier mechanism for flexible safety boundaries, and 4) dedicated risk modeling capturing both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty.

Result: Extensive evaluations show GTR2L significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and human drivers in terms of success rate, collision/violation reduction, and driving efficiency across diverse safety-critical traffic scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed GTR2L framework effectively addresses safety challenges in autonomous driving through integrated game theory, adaptive uncertainty management, and explicit risk modeling, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous driving (AD) remains a significant challenge,
especially in highly dynamic and complex traffic environments where diverse
agents interact and unexpected hazards frequently emerge. Traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) methods often struggle to balance safety,
efficiency, and adaptability, as they primarily focus on reward maximization
without explicitly modeling risk or safety constraints. To address these
limitations, this study proposes a novel game-theoretic risk-shaped RL (GTR2L)
framework for safe AD. GTR2L incorporates a multi-level game-theoretic world
model that jointly predicts the interactive behaviors of surrounding vehicles
and their associated risks, along with an adaptive rollout horizon that adjusts
dynamically based on predictive uncertainty. Furthermore, an uncertainty-aware
barrier mechanism enables flexible modulation of safety boundaries. A dedicated
risk modeling approach is also proposed, explicitly capturing both epistemic
and aleatoric uncertainty to guide constrained policy optimization and enhance
decision-making in complex environments. Extensive evaluations across diverse
and safety-critical traffic scenarios show that GTR2L significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, including human drivers, in terms of success rate,
collision and violation reduction, and driving efficiency. The code is

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoVer is a test-time scaling framework that enhances Vision-Language-Action models using a Robot Process Reward Model as a verifier, enabling better decision-making without modifying model architecture or weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of scaling VLA models through expensive data collection and model size increases by providing a cost-effective test-time enhancement approach.

Method: Uses a Robot Process Reward Model to assign process rewards and predict action-space directions, generates multiple candidate actions, expands them along predicted directions, and selects optimal actions using shared perception feature caching.

Result: Enables transformation of computational resources into improved action decision-making without additional training overhead.

Conclusion: Provides a plug-and-play test-time scaling framework that effectively enhances VLA model capabilities through efficient candidate generation and selection.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have become a prominent paradigm for
embodied intelligence, yet further performance improvements typically rely on
scaling up training data and model size -- an approach that is prohibitively
expensive for robotics and fundamentally limited by data collection costs.We
address this limitation with $\mathbf{RoVer}$, an embodied test-time scaling
framework that uses a $\mathbf{Ro}$bot Process Reward Model (PRM) as a
Test-Time $\mathbf{Ver}$ifier to enhance the capabilities of existing VLA
models without modifying their architectures or weights. Specifically, RoVer
(i) assigns scalar-based process rewards to evaluate the reliability of
candidate actions, and (ii) predicts an action-space direction for candidate
expansion/refinement. During inference, RoVer generates multiple candidate
actions concurrently from the base policy, expands them along PRM-predicted
directions, and then scores all candidates with PRM to select the optimal
action for execution. Notably, by caching shared perception features, it can
amortize perception cost and evaluate more candidates under the same test-time
computational budget. Essentially, our approach effectively transforms
available computing resources into better action decision-making, realizing the
benefits of test-time scaling without extra training overhead. Our
contributions are threefold: (1) a general, plug-and-play test-time scaling
framework for VLAs; (2) a PRM that jointly provides scalar process rewards and
an action-space direction to guide exploration; and (3) an efficient
direction-guided sampling strategy that leverages a shared perception cache to
enable scalable candidate generation and selection during inference.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AMO-HEAD is a lightweight EKF-based heading estimation approach for UAVs that uses adaptive process noise covariance and magnetic disturbance compensation to achieve reliable heading in magnetically disturbed indoor environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Indoor UAV inspection tasks require accurate heading estimation, but cluttered indoor environments cause severe magnetic disturbances that degrade heading accuracy using conventional methods.

Method: Uses an Extended Kalman Filter with gyroscope angular rate integration for quaternion propagation, corrected by accelerometer and magnetometer data. Features adaptive process noise covariance for gyroscope noise modeling and a scaling factor for magnetic disturbance compensation.

Result: Extensive real-world experiments show the algorithm provides precise heading estimation under magnetically disturbed conditions in indoor environments.

Conclusion: AMO-HEAD effectively addresses magnetic disturbance challenges in indoor UAV operations through adaptive noise modeling and magnetic compensation, achieving reliable heading estimation.

Abstract: Accurate and robust heading estimation is crucial for unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) when conducting indoor inspection tasks. However, the cluttered
nature of indoor environments often introduces severe magnetic disturbances,
which can significantly degrade heading accuracy. To address this challenge,
this paper presents an Adaptive MARG-Only Heading (AMO-HEAD) estimation
approach for UAVs operating in magnetically disturbed environments. AMO-HEAD is
a lightweight and computationally efficient Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)
framework that leverages inertial and magnetic sensors to achieve reliable
heading estimation. In the proposed approach, gyroscope angular rate
measurements are integrated to propagate the quaternion state, which is
subsequently corrected using accelerometer and magnetometer data. The corrected
quaternion is then used to compute the UAV's heading. An adaptive process noise
covariance method is introduced to model and compensate for gyroscope
measurement noise, bias drift, and discretization errors arising from the Euler
method integration. To mitigate the effects of external magnetic disturbances,
a scaling factor is applied based on real-time magnetic deviation detection. A
theoretical observability analysis of the proposed AMO-HEAD is performed using
the Lie derivative. Extensive experiments were conducted in real world indoor
environments with customized UAV platforms. The results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in providing precise heading estimation
under magnetically disturbed conditions.

Result: The approach recovers commonsense spatial semantics consistent with ground truth, yielding diverse, clean 3D point clouds usable in motion planning on a Matterport3D benchmark.

Conclusion: Generative models show promise as a rich source of priors for robotic planning, effectively representing both occupancy and target-location uncertainty in unobserved regions.

Abstract: Priors are vital for planning under partial observability, yet difficult to
obtain in practice. We present a sampling-based pipeline that leverages
large-scale pretrained generative models to produce probabilistic priors
capturing environmental uncertainty and spatio-semantic relationships in a
zero-shot manner. Conditioned on partial observations, the pipeline recovers
complete RGB-D point cloud samples with occupancy and target semantics,
formulated to be directly useful in configuration-space planning. We establish
a Matterport3D benchmark of rooms partially visible through doorways, where a
robot must navigate to an unobserved target object. Effective priors for this
setting must represent both occupancy and target-location uncertainty in
unobserved regions. Experiments show that our approach recovers commonsense
spatial semantics consistent with ground truth, yielding diverse, clean 3D
point clouds usable in motion planning, highlight the promise of generative
models as a rich source of priors for robotic planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current simulation-based learning achieves ~80% success rates for robotic assembly, which is insufficient for industry standards and makes policy chaining brittle due to high variance across initial conditions.

Method: Proposes Refinery framework with Bayesian Optimization-guided fine-tuning to improve individual policies and Gaussian Mixture Model-based sampling during deployment to select optimal initializations.

Result: Achieves 91.51% success rate in simulation (10.98% improvement over state-of-the-art) with comparable real-world performance, and successfully assembles up to 8 parts through policy chaining without multi-step training.

Conclusion: Refinery effectively bridges the performance gap in simulation-based learning, enabling robust policy performance across diverse initial conditions and reliable chaining for long-horizon assembly tasks.

Abstract: Simulation-based learning has enabled policies for precise, contact-rich
tasks (e.g., robotic assembly) to reach high success rates (~80%) under high
levels of observation noise and control error. Although such performance may be
sufficient for research applications, it falls short of industry standards and
makes policy chaining exceptionally brittle. A key limitation is the high
variance in individual policy performance across diverse initial conditions. We
introduce Refinery, an effective framework that bridges this performance gap,
robustifying policy performance across initial conditions. We propose Bayesian
Optimization-guided fine-tuning to improve individual policies, and Gaussian
Mixture Model-based sampling during deployment to select initializations that
maximize execution success. Using Refinery, we improve mean success rates by
10.98% over state-of-the-art methods in simulation-based learning for robotic
assembly, reaching 91.51% in simulation and comparable performance in the real
world. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these fine-tuned policies can be
chained to accomplish long-horizon, multi-part

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most robotic grasping methods are designed for single gripper types, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios requiring diverse end-effectors.

Method: Uses a hierarchical two-stage architecture: Grasp Point Predictor (GPP) identifies optimal locations using global scene info and gripper specs, then Angle-Width Predictor (AWP) refines grasp angle and width using local features with contrastive learning for zero-shot generalization.

Result: Achieves competitive grasp success rates across various gripper types with substantial improvements in inference speed compared to existing gripper-aware methods.

Conclusion: XGrasp provides an efficient modular framework for multi-gripper grasp detection that enables zero-shot generalization and integrates with vision foundation models for future vision-language capabilities.

Abstract: Most robotic grasping methods are typically designed for single gripper
types, which limits their applicability in real-world scenarios requiring
diverse end-effectors. We propose XGrasp, a real-time gripper-aware grasp
detection framework that efficiently handles multiple gripper configurations.
The proposed method addresses data scarcity by systematically augmenting
existing datasets with multi-gripper annotations. XGrasp employs a hierarchical
two-stage architecture. In the first stage, a Grasp Point Predictor (GPP)
identifies optimal locations using global scene information and gripper
specifications. In the second stage, an Angle-Width Predictor (AWP) refines the
grasp angle and width using local features. Contrastive learning in the AWP
module enables zero-shot generalization to unseen grippers by learning
fundamental grasping characteristics. The modular framework integrates
seamlessly with vision foundation models, providing pathways for future
vision-language capabilities. The experimental results demonstrate competitive
grasp success rates across various gripper types, while achieving substantial
improvements in inference speed compared to existing gripper-aware methods.

Motivation: Existing autonomous cooperative planning strategies cannot fully address multiple uncertainties in perception, planning, and communication, limiting effectiveness and security in multi-vehicle interactions.

Method: Uses soft actor-critic (SAC) with gate recurrent units (GRUs) to learn optimal time-varying actions under imperfect state information from planning, communication, and perception uncertainties, implemented in CARLA simulation platform.

Result: The proposed DRLACP framework effectively learns and performs cooperative planning, outperforming other baseline methods across different scenarios with imperfect autonomous vehicle state information.

Conclusion: The DRLACP framework successfully addresses various uncertainties in cooperative motion planning and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods, making it a promising approach for intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: In future intelligent transportation systems, autonomous cooperative planning
(ACP), becomes a promising technique to increase the effectiveness and security
of multi-vehicle interactions. However, multiple uncertainties cannot be fully
addressed for existing ACP strategies, e.g. perception, planning, and
communication uncertainties. To address these, a novel deep reinforcement
learning-based autonomous cooperative planning (DRLACP) framework is proposed
to tackle various uncertainties on cooperative motion planning schemes.
Specifically, the soft actor-critic (SAC) with the implementation of gate
recurrent units (GRUs) is adopted to learn the deterministic optimal
time-varying actions with imperfect state information occurred by planning,
communication, and perception uncertainties. In addition, the real-time actions
of autonomous vehicles (AVs) are demonstrated via the Car Learning to Act

learns and performs cooperative planning effectively, which outperforms other
baseline methods under different scenarios with imperfect AV state information.

Motivation: Combining generalizable, lifelike motions with robust scene perception for humanoid robots interacting with real-world environments is challenging, as prior approaches have advanced these capabilities individually but not in a unified system.

Method: PhysHSI uses a simulation training pipeline with adversarial motion prior-based policy learning to imitate natural human interaction data, and a real-world deployment system with coarse-to-fine object localization combining LiDAR and camera inputs.

Conclusion: PhysHSI successfully integrates lifelike motion generation with robust scene perception in a unified system, enabling humanoid robots to autonomously perform diverse interaction tasks in real-world environments with natural behaviors.

Abstract: Deploying humanoid robots to interact with real-world environments--such as

natural humanoid-scene interaction data across diverse scenarios, achieving
both generalization and lifelike behaviors. For real-world deployment, we
introduce a coarse-to-fine object localization module that combines LiDAR and

TL;DR: Flow Planner is a novel autonomous driving planning framework that addresses interactive behavior modeling through trajectory tokenization, temporal-spatial fusion architecture, and flow matching with classifier-free guidance, achieving state-of-the-art performance on complex driving scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based approaches for autonomous driving planning lack dedicated mechanisms for modeling interactive behaviors and struggle with scarce interactive driving data, making conventional imitation learning methods inadequate for capturing high-value interactive behaviors in complex driving scenarios.

Method: The method includes: 1) fine-grained trajectory tokenization that decomposes trajectories into overlapping segments to reduce complexity; 2) sophisticated architecture for efficient temporal and spatial fusion of planning and scene information; 3) flow matching with classifier-free guidance for multi-modal behavior generation that dynamically reweights agent interactions during inference.

Result: Experimental results on the large-scale nuPlan dataset and challenging interactive interPlan dataset demonstrate that Flow Planner achieves state-of-the-art performance among learning-based approaches while effectively modeling interactive behaviors in complex driving scenarios.

Conclusion: Flow Planner successfully addresses the fundamental challenge of modeling interactive driving behaviors through coordinated innovations in data modeling, model architecture, and learning scheme, providing a critical boost for interactive scenario understanding in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Modeling interactive driving behaviors in complex scenarios remains a
fundamental challenge for autonomous driving planning. Learning-based
approaches attempt to address this challenge with advanced generative models,
removing the dependency on over-engineered architectures for representation
fusion. However, brute-force implementation by simply stacking transformer
blocks lacks a dedicated mechanism for modeling interactive behaviors that are
common in real driving scenarios. The scarcity of interactive driving data
further exacerbates this problem, leaving conventional imitation learning
methods ill-equipped to capture high-value interactive behaviors. We propose
Flow Planner, which tackles these problems through coordinated innovations in
data modeling, model architecture, and learning scheme. Specifically, we first
introduce fine-grained trajectory tokenization, which decomposes the trajectory
into overlapping segments to decrease the complexity of whole trajectory
modeling. With a sophisticatedly designed architecture, we achieve efficient
temporal and spatial fusion of planning and scene information, to better
capture interactive behaviors. In addition, the framework incorporates flow
matching with classifier-free guidance for multi-modal behavior generation,
which dynamically reweights agent interactions during inference to maintain
coherent response strategies, providing a critical boost for interactive
scenario understanding. Experimental results on the large-scale nuPlan dataset
and challenging interactive interPlan dataset demonstrate that Flow Planner
achieves state-of-the-art performance among learning-based approaches while
effectively modeling interactive behaviors in complex driving scenarios.

TL;DR: A soft robotic knee exoskeleton using origami-inspired pneumatic actuators with Deep Koopman Network modeling and Model Predictive Control for stroke rehabilitation, outperforming traditional PID control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rigid exoskeletons are heavy, difficult to wear, and require complex compliance control, while soft exoskeletons offer comfort but face challenges in controlling complex nonlinear human-robot interaction dynamics.

Method: Designed a soft knee exoskeleton using origami-inspired pneumatic actuators, used Deep Koopman Network to model human-robot interaction dynamics (with EMG signals and PWM duty cycle as inputs), and implemented Model Predictive Control for real-time rehabilitation training.

Result: Integration of EMG signals significantly improved model accuracy, personalized models performed better than non-personalized ones, and the control framework outperformed traditional PID control in both passive and active training modes.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an effective control framework for soft rehabilitation robots that combines comfort with precise control performance.

Abstract: Effective rehabilitation methods are essential for the recovery of lower limb
dysfunction caused by stroke. Nowadays, robotic exoskeletons have shown great
potentials in rehabilitation. Nevertheless, traditional rigid exoskeletons are
usually heavy and need a lot of work to help the patients to put them on.
Moreover, it also requires extra compliance control to guarantee the safety. In
contrast, soft exoskeletons are easy and comfortable to wear and have intrinsic
compliance, but their complex nonlinear human-robot interaction dynamics would
pose significant challenges for control. In this work, based on the pneumatic
actuators inspired by origami, we design a rehabilitation exoskeleton for knee
that is easy and comfortable to wear. To guarantee the control performance and
enable a nice human-robot interaction, we first use Deep Koopman Network to
model the human-robot interaction dynamics. In particular, by viewing the
electromyography (EMG) signals and the duty cycle of the PWM wave that controls
the pneumatic robot's valves and pump as the inputs, the linear Koopman model
accurately captures the complex human-robot interaction dynamics. Next, based
on the obtained Koopman model, we further use Model Predictive Control (MPC) to
control the soft robot and help the user to do rehabilitation training in
real-time. The goal of the rehabilitation training is to track a given
reference signal shown on the screen. Experiments show that by integrating the
EMG signals into the Koopman model, we have improved the model accuracy to
great extent. In addition, a personalized Koopman model trained from the
individual's own data performs better than the non-personalized model.
Consequently, our control framework outperforms the traditional PID control in
both passive and active training modes. Hence the proposed method provides a
new control framework for soft rehabilitation robots.

TL;DR: This paper systematically evaluates different SO(3) rotation representations for robotic control tasks in reinforcement learning, finding that representing actions as tangent vectors in the local frame yields the most reliable results across algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic control tasks require policies to act on orientations (SO(3)), but the geometry of SO(3) makes this challenging since it admits no global, smooth, minimal parameterization. Different representations like Euler angles, quaternions, and rotation matrices introduce distinct constraints and failure modes, and their implications for reinforcement learning actions remain unclear.

Method: Systematically evaluated SO(3) action representations across three continuous control algorithms (PPO, SAC, TD3) under dense and sparse rewards. Compared how representations shape exploration, interact with entropy regularization, and affect training stability through empirical studies. Analyzed implications of different projections for obtaining valid rotations from Euclidean network outputs.

Result: Across robotics benchmarks, representation-induced geometry strongly influences exploration and optimization. Representing actions as tangent vectors in the local frame yielded the most reliable results across algorithms. Quantified the practical impact of representation choices and distilled implementation-ready guidelines.

Conclusion: The choice of rotation action representation significantly affects RL performance in robotic control tasks. Tangent vector representations in local frames provide the most consistent and reliable results across different algorithms and reward conditions.

Abstract: Many robotic control tasks require policies to act on orientations, yet the
geometry of SO(3) makes this nontrivial. Because SO(3) admits no global,
smooth, minimal parameterization, common representations such as Euler angles,
quaternions, rotation matrices, and Lie algebra coordinates introduce distinct
constraints and failure modes. While these trade-offs are well studied for
supervised learning, their implications for actions in reinforcement learning
remain unclear. We systematically evaluate SO(3) action representations across
three standard continuous control algorithms, PPO, SAC, and TD3, under dense
and sparse rewards. We compare how representations shape exploration, interact
with entropy regularization, and affect training stability through empirical
studies and analyze the implications of different projections for obtaining
valid rotations from Euclidean network outputs. Across a suite of robotics
benchmarks, we quantify the practical impact of these choices and distill
simple, implementation-ready guidelines for selecting and using rotation
actions. Our results highlight that representation-induced geometry strongly
influences exploration and optimization and show that representing actions as
tangent vectors in the local frame yields the most reliable results across
algorithms.

*Yuhui Fu,Feiyang Xie,Chaoyi Xu,Jing Xiong,Haoqi Yuan,Zongqing Lu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DemoHLM enables humanoid robots to perform generalizable loco-manipulation tasks using a single demonstration in simulation, combining a universal whole-body controller with learned manipulation policies for robust real-world performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Loco-manipulation is crucial for humanoid robots to interact effectively in human environments, but current approaches rely on hard-coded tasks or costly real-world data collection, limiting autonomy and generalization.

Method: Uses a hierarchical framework with a low-level universal whole-body controller for omnidirectional mobility and high-level manipulation policies learned via synthetic data generation and imitation learning in simulation, using closed-loop visual feedback.

Result: Shows positive correlation between synthetic data amount and policy performance, and successfully transfers to real-world Unitree G1 robot with RGB-D camera, demonstrating robust performance across ten loco-manipulation tasks under spatial variations.

Conclusion: DemoHLM provides an effective and data-efficient approach for humanoid loco-manipulation that enables generalization from simulation to real-world applications with minimal demonstration requirements.

Abstract: Loco-manipulation is a fundamental challenge for humanoid robots to achieve
versatile interactions in human environments. Although recent studies have made
significant progress in humanoid whole-body control, loco-manipulation remains
underexplored and often relies on hard-coded task definitions or costly
real-world data collection, which limits autonomy and generalization. We
present DemoHLM, a framework for humanoid loco-manipulation that enables
generalizable loco-manipulation on a real humanoid robot from a single
demonstration in simulation. DemoHLM adopts a hierarchy that integrates a
low-level universal whole-body controller with high-level manipulation policies
for multiple tasks. The whole-body controller maps whole-body motion commands
to joint torques and provides omnidirectional mobility for the humanoid robot.
The manipulation policies, learned in simulation via our data generation and
imitation learning pipeline, command the whole-body controller with closed-loop
visual feedback to execute challenging loco-manipulation tasks. Experiments
show a positive correlation between the amount of synthetic data and policy
performance, underscoring the effectiveness of our data generation pipeline and
the data efficiency of our approach. Real-world experiments on a Unitree G1
robot equipped with an RGB-D camera validate the sim-to-real transferability of
DemoHLM, demonstrating robust performance under spatial variations across ten
loco-manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A rotor-failure-aware quadrotor navigation system that enables autonomous flight in unknown environments despite rotor failures through integrated failure detection, trajectory planning, and fault-tolerant control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rotor failures in quadrotors cause high-speed rotation and vibration due to imbalance, creating significant challenges for autonomous flight in unknown environments. Existing approaches only address fault-tolerant control and predefined trajectory tracking, lacking comprehensive online failure detection, diagnosis, and adaptive planning.

Method: 1) Composite FDD-based nonlinear model predictive controller with motor dynamics for fast failure detection and flight stability; 2) Rotor-failure-aware planner using FDD results with spatial-temporal joint optimization; 3) LiDAR-based quadrotor platform with four anti-torque plates for reliable perception under high-speed rotation.

Result: Superior performance in addressing rotor failures (propeller unloading and motor stoppage) compared to state-of-the-art methods. First demonstration of autonomous quadrotor flight with rotor failures in challenging environments including cluttered rooms and unknown forests.

Conclusion: The proposed integrated approach successfully enables autonomous quadrotor navigation in complex unknown environments despite rotor failures, overcoming limitations of existing methods through comprehensive failure detection, adaptive planning, and fault-tolerant control.

Abstract: Rotor failures in quadrotors may result in high-speed rotation and vibration
due to rotor imbalance, which introduces significant challenges for autonomous
flight in unknown environments. The mainstream approaches against rotor
failures rely on fault-tolerant control (FTC) and predefined trajectory
tracking. To the best of our knowledge, online failure detection and diagnosis
(FDD), trajectory planning, and FTC of the post-failure quadrotors in unknown
and complex environments have not yet been achieved. This paper presents a
rotor-failure-aware quadrotor navigation system designed to mitigate the
impacts of rotor imbalance. First, a composite FDD-based nonlinear model
predictive controller (NMPC), incorporating motor dynamics, is designed to
ensure fast failure detection and flight stability. Second, a
rotor-failure-aware planner is designed to leverage FDD results and
spatial-temporal joint optimization, while a LiDAR-based quadrotor platform
with four anti-torque plates is designed to enable reliable perception under
high-speed rotation. Lastly, extensive benchmarks against state-of-the-art
methods highlight the superior performance of the proposed approach in
addressing rotor failures, including propeller unloading and motor stoppage.
The experimental results demonstrate, for the first time, that our approach
enables autonomous quadrotor flight with rotor failures in challenging
environments, including cluttered rooms and unknown forests.

*Weixi Situ,Hanjing Ye,Jianwei Peng,Yu Zhan,Hong Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes an adaptive trajectory sampling method with multi-objective cost evaluation and prediction-aware MPPI controller for robust robot person following in crowded environments with occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robot person following methods struggle with frequent occlusions in dynamic crowded environments, relying on oversimplified heuristics that cannot handle complex occlusions from moving obstacles.

Method: Uses adaptive trajectory sampling to generate dense candidate points in socially aware zones, evaluates them with multi-objective cost function, and employs prediction-aware MPPI controller for trajectory tracking and proactive collision avoidance.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in smoothness, safety, robustness, and human comfort, with effectiveness demonstrated on real mobile robot.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses occlusion challenges in robot person following through adaptive sampling and prediction-aware control, achieving superior performance in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Robot person following (RPF) is a core capability in human-robot interaction,
enabling robots to assist users in daily activities, collaborative work, and
other service scenarios. However, achieving practical RPF remains challenging
due to frequent occlusions, particularly in dynamic and crowded environments.
Existing approaches often rely on fixed-point following or sparse
candidate-point selection with oversimplified heuristics, which cannot
adequately handle complex occlusions caused by moving obstacles such as
pedestrians. To address these limitations, we propose an adaptive trajectory
sampling method that generates dense candidate points within socially aware
zones and evaluates them using a multi-objective cost function. Based on the
optimal point, a person-following trajectory is estimated relative to the
predicted motion of the target. We further design a prediction-aware model
predictive path integral (MPPI) controller that simultaneously tracks this
trajectory and proactively avoids collisions using predicted pedestrian
motions. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in smoothness, safety, robustness, and human
comfort, with its effectiveness further demonstrated on a mobile robot in
real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic manipulation requires representations that capture invariant interaction patterns across environments and tasks for effective generalization.

Method: Combines cross-modal correlation network to identify persistent patterns across sensory modalities with multi-horizon predictor for hierarchical temporal organization.

Result: Significant performance improvements in simulated benchmarks and real-world deployments; learned concepts resemble human-interpretable manipulation primitives without semantic supervision.

Conclusion: Advances representation learning for manipulation and provides practical approach to enhance robotic performance in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Effective generalization in robotic manipulation requires representations
that capture invariant patterns of interaction across environments and tasks.
We present a self-supervised framework for learning hierarchical manipulation
concepts that encode these invariant patterns through cross-modal sensory
correlations and multi-level temporal abstractions without requiring human
annotation. Our approach combines a cross-modal correlation network that
identifies persistent patterns across sensory modalities with a multi-horizon
predictor that organizes representations hierarchically across temporal scales.
Manipulation concepts learned through this dual structure enable policies to
focus on transferable relational patterns while maintaining awareness of both
immediate actions and longer-term goals. Empirical evaluation across simulated
benchmarks and real-world deployments demonstrates significant performance
improvements with our concept-enhanced policies. Analysis reveals that the
learned concepts resemble human-interpretable manipulation primitives despite
receiving no semantic supervision. This work advances both the understanding of
representation learning for manipulation and provides a practical approach to
enhancing robotic performance in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables efficient and precise execution of complex industrial operations by humanoid robots, successfully addressing both computational complexity and precision requirements.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for humanoid robots to execute

novel MIP formulation optimizes standing position selection and trajectory
length, minimizing task completion time. Furthermore, an MPC system with
simplified kinematics and single-step position correction ensures
millimeter-level end-effector tracking accuracy. Validated through simulations
and experiments on the Kuavo 4Pro humanoid platform, the framework demonstrates
low time cost and a high success rate in multi-location tasks, enabling
efficient and precise execution of complex industrial operations.

### [287] [A Faster and More Reliable Middleware for Autonomous Driving Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11448)
*Yuankai He,Hanlin Chen,Weisong Shi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SIM is a shared-memory transport for ROS 2 that reduces latency by up to 98% compared to standard transports, enabling faster perception-to-actuation cycles in autonomous vehicles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ROS 2 middleware introduces significant overheads (serialization, copying, discovery) that shrink the time budget for safety-critical control loops in high-speed autonomous vehicles.

Method: SIM uses shared memory with native data layouts, lock-free bounded double buffers that prioritize freshness over completeness, and integrates into ROS 2 with minimal code changes.

Result: On NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, SIM reduced latency by 98% vs ROS 2 transports, increased localization frequency from 7.5Hz to 9.5Hz, and cut perception-to-decision latency from 521.91ms to 290.26ms, reducing emergency braking distance by 13.6ft at 40mph.

Conclusion: SIM provides a practical solution for latency-critical autonomous vehicle systems by operating alongside ROS 2 while dramatically reducing transport overhead through shared-memory optimization.

Abstract: Ensuring safety in high-speed autonomous vehicles requires rapid control
loops and tightly bounded delays from perception to actuation. Many open-source
autonomy systems rely on ROS 2 middleware; when multiple sensor and control
nodes share one compute unit, ROS 2 and its DDS transports add significant
(de)serialization, copying, and discovery overheads, shrinking the available
time budget. We present Sensor-in-Memory (SIM), a shared-memory transport
designed for intra-host pipelines in autonomous vehicles. SIM keeps sensor data
in native memory layouts (e.g., cv::Mat, PCL), uses lock-free bounded double
buffers that overwrite old data to prioritize freshness, and integrates into
ROS 2 nodes with four lines of code. Unlike traditional middleware, SIM
operates beside ROS 2 and is optimized for applications where data freshness
and minimal latency outweigh guaranteed completeness. SIM provides sequence
numbers, a writer heartbeat, and optional checksums to ensure ordering,
liveness, and basic integrity. On an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, SIM reduces
data-transport latency by up to 98% compared to ROS 2 zero-copy transports such
as FastRTPS and Zenoh, lowers mean latency by about 95%, and narrows
95th/99th-percentile tail latencies by around 96%. In tests on a
production-ready Level 4 vehicle running Autoware.Universe, SIM increased
localization frequency from 7.5 Hz to 9.5 Hz. Applied across all
latency-critical modules, SIM cut average perception-to-decision latency from
521.91 ms to 290.26 ms, reducing emergency braking distance at 40 mph (64 km/h)
on dry concrete by 13.6 ft (4.14 m).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving mission objectives in aerial combat is challenging due to imperfect situational awareness and nonlinear flight dynamics.

Method: Hierarchical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with two abstraction levels: low-level policies for precise control maneuvers and high-level policies for tactical commands, combined with heterogeneous agent dynamics, curriculum learning, league-play, and an adapted training algorithm.

Result: Empirical results show improved learning efficiency and combat performance in complex dogfight scenarios.

Conclusion: The hierarchical approach effectively addresses the challenges of aerial combat simulation by organizing decision-making into tactical and control layers.

Abstract: Achieving mission objectives in a realistic simulation of aerial combat is
highly challenging due to imperfect situational awareness and nonlinear flight
dynamics. In this work, we introduce a novel 3D multi-agent air combat
environment and a Hierarchical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning framework to
tackle these challenges. Our approach combines heterogeneous agent dynamics,
curriculum learning, league-play, and a newly adapted training algorithm. To
this end, the decision-making process is organized into two abstraction levels:
low-level policies learn precise control maneuvers, while high-level policies
issue tactical commands based on mission objectives. Empirical results show
that our hierarchical approach improves both learning efficiency and combat
performance in complex dogfight scenarios.

*Murad Dawood,Usama Ahmed Siddiquie,Shahram Khorshidi,Maren Bennewitz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A modular cost-aware regulator for safe RL that scales actions based on predicted constraint violations, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Safety Gym tasks with 126x fewer violations and 10x higher returns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safe RL methods either use single policies with conflicting objectives (causing instability) or external safety filters that override actions and require prior system knowledge.

Method: Proposes a modular regulator that scales agent actions based on predicted constraint violations using smooth action modulation rather than overriding. The regulator is trained to minimize violations while avoiding action suppression.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art return-to-cost ratios on Safety Gym locomotion tasks with sparse costs, reducing constraint violations by up to 126 times while increasing returns by over an order of magnitude.

Conclusion: The modular cost-aware regulator provides an effective approach for safe RL that preserves exploration through smooth action modulation and integrates seamlessly with off-policy methods like SAC and TD3.

Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (RL) seeks to mitigate unsafe behaviors that
arise from exploration during training by reducing constraint violations while
maintaining task performance. Existing approaches typically rely on a single
policy to jointly optimize reward and safety, which can cause instability due
to conflicting objectives, or they use external safety filters that override
actions and require prior system knowledge. In this paper, we propose a modular
cost-aware regulator that scales the agent's actions based on predicted
constraint violations, preserving exploration through smooth action modulation
rather than overriding the policy. The regulator is trained to minimize
constraint violations while avoiding degenerate suppression of actions. Our
approach integrates seamlessly with off-policy RL methods such as SAC and TD3,
and achieves state-of-the-art return-to-cost ratios on Safety Gym locomotion
tasks with sparse costs, reducing constraint violations by up to 126 times
while increasing returns by over an order of magnitude compared to prior
methods.

TL;DR: A dual-quaternion based NMPC framework (DQ-NMPC) for quadrotor flight that achieves superior tracking performance and handles aggressive maneuvers in confined spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving precise control in agile quadrotor flights is challenging due to underactuated dynamics and strong coupling between translational and rotational movements.

Method: Proposed a novel NMPC framework using dual-quaternions to represent quadrotor dynamics and pose error directly on the dual-quaternion manifold, enabling compact and globally non-singular formulation.

Result: Reduced position and orientation errors by up to 56.11% and 56.77% compared to baseline, handled aggressive trajectories with speeds up to 13.66 m/s and 4.2 g acceleration in confined spaces where baseline failed.

Conclusion: The dual-quaternion based NMPC framework provides better numerical conditioning and significantly improved tracking performance for agile quadrotor flight control.

Abstract: MAVs have great potential to assist humans in complex tasks, with
applications ranging from logistics to emergency response. Their agility makes
them ideal for operations in complex and dynamic environments. However,
achieving precise control in agile flights remains a significant challenge,
particularly due to the underactuated nature of quadrotors and the strong
coupling between their translational and rotational dynamics. In this work, we
propose a novel NMPC framework based on dual-quaternions (DQ-NMPC) for
quadrotor flight. By representing both quadrotor dynamics and the pose error
directly on the dual-quaternion manifold, our approach enables a compact and
globally non-singular formulation that captures the quadrotor coupled dynamics.
We validate our approach through simulations and real-world experiments,
demonstrating better numerical conditioning and significantly improved tracking
performance, with reductions in position and orientation errors of up to 56.11%
and 56.77%, compared to a conventional baseline NMPC method. Furthermore, our
controller successfully handles aggressive trajectories, reaching maximum
speeds up to 13.66 m/s and accelerations reaching 4.2 g within confined space
conditions of dimensions 11m x 4.5m x 3.65m under which the baseline controller
fails.

TL;DR: IntersectioNDE is a data-driven simulator for complex urban intersections that uses an Interaction Decoupling Strategy to learn compositional dynamics from agent subsets, enabling robust simulation of dense, heterogeneous traffic interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing traffic simulators struggle with modeling dense, heterogeneous interactions at urban intersections, particularly in countries like China with diverse agents (motorized vehicles, non-motorized vehicles, pedestrians), and face challenges with mode collapse and long-term instability when learning high-dimensional joint distributions.

Method: Proposed IntersectioNDE simulator with Interaction Decoupling Strategy (IDS) - a training paradigm that learns compositional dynamics from agent subsets for marginal-to-joint simulation, integrated into a scene-aware Transformer network with specialized training techniques.

Result: Experiments on the CiCross dataset show IntersectioNDE outperforms baseline methods in simulation fidelity, stability, and ability to replicate complex, distribution-level urban traffic dynamics.

Conclusion: IntersectioNDE provides a robust solution for simulating dense, heterogeneous urban intersection traffic, addressing key limitations of existing data-driven simulators through its novel interaction decoupling approach.

Abstract: Realistic traffic simulation is critical for ensuring the safety and
reliability of autonomous vehicles (AVs), especially in complex and diverse
urban traffic environments. However, existing data-driven simulators face two
key challenges: a limited focus on modeling dense, heterogeneous interactions
at urban intersections - which are prevalent, crucial, and practically
significant in countries like China, featuring diverse agents including
motorized vehicles (MVs), non-motorized vehicles (NMVs), and pedestrians - and
the inherent difficulty in robustly learning high-dimensional joint
distributions for such high-density scenes, often leading to mode collapse and
long-term simulation instability. We introduce City Crossings Dataset
(CiCross), a large-scale dataset collected from a real-world urban
intersection, uniquely capturing dense, heterogeneous multi-agent interactions,
particularly with a substantial proportion of MVs, NMVs and pedestrians. Based
on this dataset, we propose IntersectioNDE (Intersection Naturalistic Driving
Environment), a data-driven simulator tailored for complex urban intersection
scenarios. Its core component is the Interaction Decoupling Strategy (IDS), a
training paradigm that learns compositional dynamics from agent subsets,
enabling the marginal-to-joint simulation. Integrated into a scene-aware
Transformer network with specialized training techniques, IDS significantly
enhances simulation robustness and long-term stability for modeling
heterogeneous interactions. Experiments on CiCross show that IntersectioNDE
outperforms baseline methods in simulation fidelity, stability, and its ability
to replicate complex, distribution-level urban traffic dynamics.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NaviGait is a hierarchical framework that combines trajectory optimization with reinforcement learning for robust bipedal locomotion, using pre-optimized gait libraries and RL-based corrections to achieve stable and interpretable control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL methods for bipedal locomotion suffer from complex reward design, while trajectory optimization methods are brittle to real-world disturbances. The goal is to combine the strengths of both approaches.

Method: Hierarchical framework using offline-optimized gait library with smooth interpolation for reference motions, plus RL policy that provides joint-level and velocity command residual corrections to stabilize trajectories.

Result: Faster training compared to conventional and imitation-based RL, produces motions closest to original references, simplifies reward design by leveraging motion priors from trajectory optimization.

Conclusion: NaviGait offers a scalable and generalizable approach for dynamic locomotion by decoupling high-level motion generation from low-level correction, combining interpretability of optimization with adaptability of RL.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful method to learn robust
control policies for bipedal locomotion. Yet, it can be difficult to tune
desired robot behaviors due to unintuitive and complex reward design. In
comparison, offline trajectory optimization methods, like Hybrid Zero Dynamics,
offer more tuneable, interpretable, and mathematically grounded motion plans
for high-dimensional legged systems. However, these methods often remain
brittle to real-world disturbances like external perturbations.
  In this work, we present NaviGait, a hierarchical framework that combines the
structure of trajectory optimization with the adaptability of RL for robust and
intuitive locomotion control. NaviGait leverages a library of offline-optimized
gaits and smoothly interpolates between them to produce continuous reference
motions in response to high-level commands. The policy provides both
joint-level and velocity command residual corrections to modulate and stabilize
the reference trajectories in the gait library. One notable advantage of
NaviGait is that it dramatically simplifies reward design by encoding rich
motion priors from trajectory optimization, reducing the need for finely tuned
shaping terms and enabling more stable and interpretable learning. Our
experimental results demonstrate that NaviGait enables faster training compared
to conventional and imitation-based RL, and produces motions that remain
closest to the original reference. Overall, by decoupling high-level motion
generation from low-level correction, NaviGait offers a more scalable and
generalizable approach for achieving dynamic and robust locomotion.

Motivation: Current educational robot kits are limited to egocentric perception, making it difficult to teach high-level concepts like coordinates and navigation. There's a need for accessible tools that can demonstrate these advanced robotics aspects.

Method: Developed an educational holonomous robot kit that uses an external tracking system to overcome embedded system constraints and enable perception beyond egocentric limitations.

Result: Created a robot kit that allows students to access high-level robotics problems involving coordinates and navigation that were previously unreachable with standard educational robot kits.

Conclusion: The proposed holonomous robot kit with external tracking successfully addresses the limitations of current educational robotics by enabling exploration of high-level robotics concepts while maintaining accessibility and practicality for educational settings.

Abstract: Recent developments of low cost off-the-shelf programmable components, their
modularity, and also rapid prototyping made educational robotics flourish, as
it is accessible in most schools today. They allow to illustrate and embody
theoretical problems in practical and tangible applications, and gather
multidisciplinary skills. They also give a rich natural context for
project-oriented pedagogy. However, most current robot kits all are limited to
egocentric aspect of the robots perception. This makes it difficult to access
more high-level problems involving e.g. coordinates or navigation. In this
paper we introduce an educational holonomous robot kit that comes with an
external tracking system, which lightens the constraint on embedded systems,
but allows in the same time to discover high-level aspects of robotics,
otherwise unreachable.

Conclusion: Simulation-based demonstration collection combined with diffusion policy imitation is a promising approach for acquiring general robotic scooping skills.

Abstract: Scooping items with tools such as spoons and ladles is common in daily life,
ranging from assistive feeding to retrieving items from environmental disaster
sites. However, developing a general and autonomous robotic scooping policy is
challenging since it requires reasoning about complex tool-object interactions.
Furthermore, scooping often involves manipulating deformable objects, such as
granular media or liquids, which is challenging due to their
infinite-dimensional configuration spaces and complex dynamics. We propose a
method, SCOOP'D, which uses simulation from OmniGibson (built on NVIDIA
Omniverse) to collect scooping demonstrations using algorithmic procedures that
rely on privileged state information. Then, we use generative policies via
diffusion to imitate demonstrations from observational input. We directly apply
the learned policy in diverse real-world scenarios, testing its performance on
various item quantities, item characteristics, and container types. In
zero-shot deployment, our method demonstrates promising results across 465
trials in diverse scenarios, including objects of different difficulty levels
that we categorize as "Level 1" and "Level 2." SCOOP'D outperforms all
baselines and ablations, suggesting that this is a promising approach to
acquiring robotic scooping skills. Project page is at

*Lennart Werner,Pol Eyschen,Sean Costello,Pierluigi Micarelli,Marco Hutter*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A retrofittable 2D force and payload estimation algorithm for hydraulic excavators that achieves 1% full-scale payload accuracy and 383N force magnitude accuracy without requiring special operator maneuvers or prior machine knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate real-time estimation of end effector interaction forces enables advanced automation and precise grading/digging maneuvers in heavy machinery, addressing the need for improved operational precision.

Method: Optimization-based approach that identifies dynamic models from pressure and inertial measurements, designed for retrofittability with minimal calibration and no prior knowledge of machine-specific dynamics.

Result: Achieved 1% full-scale payload accuracy, 13-degree direction accuracy, and 383N force magnitude accuracy on a 25t excavator. Validated on two different excavator platforms, outperforming classical quasistatic methods and commercial systems.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides high-accuracy force and payload estimation suitable for retrofitting existing excavators, enabling advanced automation capabilities without imposing operational constraints on operators.

Abstract: Accurate real-time estimation of end effector interaction forces in hydraulic
excavators is a key enabler for advanced automation in heavy machinery.
Accurate knowledge of these forces allows improved, precise grading and digging
maneuvers. To address these challenges, we introduce a high-accuracy,
retrofittable 2D force- and payload estimation algorithm that does not impose
additional requirements on the operator regarding trajectory, acceleration or
the use of the slew joint. The approach is designed for retrofittability,
requires minimal calibration and no prior knowledge of machine-specific dynamic
characteristics. Specifically, we propose a method for identifying a dynamic
model, necessary to estimate both end effector interaction forces and bucket
payload during normal operation. Our optimization-based payload estimation
achieves a full-scale payload accuracy of 1%. On a standard 25 t excavator, the
online force measurement from pressure and inertial measurements achieves a
direction accuracy of 13 degree and a magnitude accuracy of 383 N. The method's
accuracy and generalization capability are validated on two excavator platforms
of different type and weight classes. We benchmark our payload estimation
against a classical quasistatic method and a commercially available system. Our
system outperforms both in accuracy and precision.

TL;DR: A framework combining learned world models with sampling-based MPC for contact-aware humanoid robot planning, trained on offline data to enable robust physical interaction tasks without demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable humanoid robots to actively use physical contact rather than avoid collisions for autonomy in unstructured environments, overcoming limitations of traditional optimization planners and sample-inefficient on-policy RL.

Method: Combines learned world model with sampling-based MPC, trained on demonstration-free offline dataset to predict outcomes in compressed latent space, using learned surrogate value function to address sparse contact rewards and sensor noise.

Result: Single scalable model supports multiple contact-aware tasks including wall support after perturbation, blocking incoming objects, and traversing height-limited arches, with improved data efficiency and multi-task capability over on-policy RL. Successfully deployed on physical humanoid for real-time contact planning.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables robust, real-time contact planning for humanoid robots using proprioception and ego-centric depth images, demonstrating effective physical interaction capabilities in unstructured environments.

Abstract: Enabling humanoid robots to exploit physical contact, rather than simply
avoid collisions, is crucial for autonomy in unstructured environments.
Traditional optimization-based planners struggle with contact complexity, while
on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) is sample-inefficient and has limited
multi-task ability. We propose a framework combining a learned world model with
sampling-based Model Predictive Control (MPC), trained on a demonstration-free
offline dataset to predict future outcomes in a compressed latent space. To
address sparse contact rewards and sensor noise, the MPC uses a learned
surrogate value function for dense, robust planning. Our single, scalable model
supports contact-aware tasks, including wall support after perturbation,
blocking incoming objects, and traversing height-limited arches, with improved
data efficiency and multi-task capability over on-policy RL. Deployed on a
physical humanoid, our system achieves robust, real-time contact planning from
proprioception and ego-centric depth images. Website:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning robotic manipulation policies directly in real world is expensive and time-consuming, while sim-to-real transfer remains challenging for tasks requiring precise dynamics.

Method: Three core components: (1) high-fidelity geometric reconstruction with 3D Gaussian splatting, (2) VLM-inferred prior distributions over physical parameters, (3) online physical parameter estimation from interaction data with ensemble-based uncertainty quantification.

Result: Achieves substantial improvements over domain randomization baseline: 100% vs 79% success rate for bottom-weighted T-block, 57% vs 23% for top-weighted T-block, and 15% faster average task completion for hammer pushing.

Conclusion: The combination of VLM and interaction information is essential for successful sim-to-real transfer in robotic manipulation tasks requiring precise dynamics.

Abstract: Learning robotic manipulation policies directly in the real world can be
expensive and time-consuming. While reinforcement learning (RL) policies
trained in simulation present a scalable alternative, effective sim-to-real
transfer remains challenging, particularly for tasks that require precise
dynamics. To address this, we propose Phys2Real, a real-to-sim-to-real RL
pipeline that combines vision-language model (VLM)-inferred physical parameter
estimates with interactive adaptation through uncertainty-aware fusion. Our
approach consists of three core components: (1) high-fidelity geometric
reconstruction with 3D Gaussian splatting, (2) VLM-inferred prior distributions
over physical parameters, and (3) online physical parameter estimation from
interaction data. Phys2Real conditions policies on interpretable physical
parameters, refining VLM predictions with online estimates via ensemble-based
uncertainty quantification. On planar pushing tasks of a T-block with varying
center of mass (CoM) and a hammer with an off-center mass distribution,
Phys2Real achieves substantial improvements over a domain randomization
baseline: 100% vs 79% success rate for the bottom-weighted T-block, 57% vs 23%
in the challenging top-weighted T-block, and 15% faster average task completion
for hammer pushing. Ablation studies indicate that the combination of VLM and
interaction information is essential for success. Project website:

*Yufa Zhou,Yixiao Wang,Xunjian Yin,Shuyan Zhou,Anru R. Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A geometric framework models LLM reasoning as smooth flows in representation space, where logical statements control flow velocities, enabling formal analysis of reasoning patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs 'think' by examining their representation space and disentangle logical structure from surface semantics, providing new tools for interpretability.

Method: Proposed geometric framework modeling reasoning as embedding trajectories, using natural deduction propositions with varied semantic carriers, and employing learned representation proxies for controlled experiments.

Result: Established that LLM reasoning corresponds to smooth flows in representation space and logical statements act as local controllers of flow velocities, with empirical validation through visualization and quantification.

Conclusion: The framework provides both conceptual foundation and practical tools for studying reasoning phenomena, offering a new lens for formal analysis and interpretability of LLM behavior.

Abstract: We study how large language models (LLMs) ``think'' through their
representation space. We propose a novel geometric framework that models an
LLM's reasoning as flows -- embedding trajectories evolving where logic goes.
We disentangle logical structure from semantics by employing the same natural
deduction propositions with varied semantic carriers, allowing us to test
whether LLMs internalize logic beyond surface form. This perspective connects
reasoning with geometric quantities such as position, velocity, and curvature,
enabling formal analysis in representation and concept spaces. Our theory
establishes: (1) LLM reasoning corresponds to smooth flows in representation
space, and (2) logical statements act as local controllers of these flows'
velocities. Using learned representation proxies, we design controlled
experiments to visualize and quantify reasoning flows, providing empirical
validation of our theoretical framework. Our work serves as both a conceptual
foundation and practical tools for studying reasoning phenomenon, offering a
new lens for interpretability and formal analysis of LLMs' behavior.

TL;DR: PULSE is a human-centric evaluation framework for LLM agents that combines user feedback with ML models to assess agent designs, deployed on a large-scale platform showing discrepancies between real-world performance and benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for LLM agents assume full automation and fail to capture the collaborative nature of real-world human-agent interactions, creating a need for more rigorous assessment methods.

Method: Proposed PULSE framework: collect user feedback, train ML model to predict user satisfaction, compute results combining human ratings with model-generated pseudo-labels. Deployed on OpenHands platform with 15k+ users to study agent design decisions.

Result: Framework reduced confidence intervals by 40% compared to standard A/B tests. Found substantial discrepancies between in-the-wild results and benchmark performance (e.g., anti-correlation between Claude-Sonnet-4 and GPT-5 comparisons). Provided practical insights on LLM backbone, planning strategy, and memory mechanisms.

Conclusion: Human-centric evaluation frameworks like PULSE provide more robust assessment of LLM agents than benchmark-driven approaches, revealing limitations of current evaluation methods and opportunities for better agent designs.

Abstract: LLM-powered agents are both a promising new technology and a source of
complexity, where choices about models, tools, and prompting can affect their
usefulness. While numerous benchmarks measure agent accuracy across domains,
they mostly assume full automation, failing to represent the collaborative
nature of real-world use cases. In this paper, we make two major steps towards
the rigorous assessment of human-agent interactions. First, we propose PULSE, a
framework for more efficient human-centric evaluation of agent designs, which
comprises collecting user feedback, training an ML model to predict user
satisfaction, and computing results by combining human satisfaction ratings
with model-generated pseudo-labels. Second, we deploy the framework on a
large-scale web platform built around the open-source software agent OpenHands,
collecting in-the-wild usage data across over 15k users. We conduct case
studies around how three agent design decisions -- choice of LLM backbone,
planning strategy, and memory mechanisms -- impact developer satisfaction
rates, yielding practical insights for software agent design. We also show how
our framework can lead to more robust conclusions about agent design, reducing
confidence intervals by 40\% compared to a standard A/B test. Finally, we find
substantial discrepancies between in-the-wild results and benchmark performance
(e.g., the anti-correlation between results comparing claude-sonnet-4 and
gpt-5), underscoring the limitations of benchmark-driven evaluation. Our
findings provide guidance for evaluations of LLM agents with humans and
identify opportunities for better agent designs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the fundamental uncertainty surrounding AI consciousness, highlighting that different influential theories will yield conflicting conclusions about whether advanced AI systems are truly conscious.

Method: Critical analysis of mainstream consciousness theories and their implications for AI, examining arguments both for and against AI consciousness across various theoretical frameworks.

Result: The analysis reveals that none of the standard arguments for or against AI consciousness are conclusive, leaving us in a position of uncertainty about whether future AI systems will be genuinely conscious.

Conclusion: We face a fundamental epistemic problem regarding AI consciousness - we will not be able to determine whether advanced AI systems are meaningfully conscious or merely experientially blank, regardless of which mainstream theories we adopt.

Abstract: This is a skeptical overview of the literature on AI consciousness. We will
soon create AI systems that are conscious according to some influential,
mainstream theories of consciousness but are not conscious according to other
influential, mainstream theories of consciousness. We will not be in a position
to know which theories are correct and whether we are surrounded by AI systems
as richly and meaningfully conscious as human beings or instead only by systems
as experientially blank as toasters. None of the standard arguments either for
or against AI consciousness takes us far.

*Junyuan Liu,Quan Qin,Guangsheng Dong,Xinglei Wang,Jiazhuang Feng,Zichao Zeng,Tao Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AETHER enhances AlphaEarth's geospatial representations by aligning EO embeddings with POI data, improving urban analysis by incorporating human-centered semantics while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current EO-driven representations like AlphaEarth capture physical/environmental patterns but lack functional and socioeconomic dimensions of cities, limiting their effectiveness for human-centered urban analysis.

Method: AETHER uses lightweight multimodal alignment to enrich AlphaEarth embeddings with POI textual representations, coupling physically grounded EO features with semantic cues about urban functions and socioeconomic contexts.

Result: In Greater London, AETHER achieved 7.2% relative improvement in land-use classification F1 and 23.6% relative reduction in Kullback-Leibler divergence for socioeconomic mapping compared to AlphaEarth baseline.

Conclusion: AETHER advances geospatial foundation models toward general-purpose urban representations that integrate both physical form and functional meaning by coupling EO with human-centered semantics in a computationally efficient framework.

Abstract: General-purpose spatial representations are essential for building
transferable geospatial foundation models (GFMs). Among them, the AlphaEarth
Foundation (AE) represents a major step toward a global, unified representation
of the Earth's surface, learning 10-meter embeddings from multi-source Earth
Observation (EO) data that capture rich physical and environmental patterns
across diverse landscapes. However, such EO-driven representations remain
limited in capturing the functional and socioeconomic dimensions of cities, as
they primarily encode physical and spectral patterns rather than human
activities or spatial functions. We propose AETHER (AlphaEarth-POI Enriched
Representation Learning), a lightweight framework that adapts AlphaEarth to
human-centered urban analysis through multimodal alignment guided by Points of
Interest (POIs). AETHER aligns AE embeddings with textual representations of
POIs, enriching physically grounded EO features with semantic cues about urban
functions and socioeconomic contexts. In Greater London, AETHER achieves
consistent gains over the AE baseline, with a 7.2% relative improvement in
land-use classification F1 and a 23.6% relative reduction in Kullback-Leibler
divergence for socioeconomic mapping. Built upon pretrained AE, AETHER
leverages a lightweight multimodal alignment to enrich it with human-centered
semantics while remaining computationally efficient and scalable for urban
applications. By coupling EO with human-centered semantics, it advances
geospatial foundation models toward general-purpose urban representations that
integrate both physical form and functional meaning.

*Xi Fang,Weijie Xu,Yuchong Zhang,Stephanie Eckman,Scott Nickleach,Chandan K. Reddy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show systematic biases in emotional intelligence where identical scenarios with different user profiles produce divergent emotional interpretations, with advantaged profiles receiving more accurate responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how user memory in personalized AI systems affects emotional reasoning and whether it reinforces social inequalities.

Method: Evaluated 15 LLMs on human-validated emotional intelligence tests using identical scenarios paired with different user profiles across demographic factors.

Result: Systematic biases emerged where advantaged profiles received more accurate emotional interpretations, with significant disparities in emotion understanding and supportive recommendations across demographic factors.

Conclusion: Personalization mechanisms in memory-enhanced AI systems can inadvertently embed social hierarchies and reinforce social inequalities in emotional reasoning.

Abstract: When an AI assistant remembers that Sarah is a single mother working two
jobs, does it interpret her stress differently than if she were a wealthy
executive? As personalized AI systems increasingly incorporate long-term user
memory, understanding how this memory shapes emotional reasoning is critical.
We investigate how user memory affects emotional intelligence in large language
models (LLMs) by evaluating 15 models on human validated emotional intelligence
tests. We find that identical scenarios paired with different user profiles
produce systematically divergent emotional interpretations. Across validated
user independent emotional scenarios and diverse user profiles, systematic
biases emerged in several high-performing LLMs where advantaged profiles
received more accurate emotional interpretations. Moreover, LLMs demonstrate
significant disparities across demographic factors in emotion understanding and
supportive recommendations tasks, indicating that personalization mechanisms
can embed social hierarchies into models emotional reasoning. These results
highlight a key challenge for memory enhanced AI: systems designed for
personalization may inadvertently reinforce social inequalities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A stepwise instruction-based intervention improves LLM logical fallacy classification by decomposing tasks into atomic procedural steps and adding verification through knowledge graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs suffer from critical reasoning gaps like hallucinations and poor logical fallacy classification due to their default System 1 processing, while reliable reasoning requires System 2 thinking. Full System 2 training is expensive, so a low-cost intervention is needed.

Method: Created a stepwise instruction dataset that decomposes fallacy classification into atomic procedural steps (simple binary questions) and augmented it with a final verification step using a relational knowledge graph of related fallacies.

Result: The procedural, rule-based intervention yielded significant improvement in LLM logical fallacy classification and provided enhanced transparency into decision-making.

Conclusion: This approach highlights a practical pathway for Neuro-symbolic architectures to address LLM reasoning deficits through low-cost, instruction-based interventions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from critical reasoning gaps, including a
tendency to hallucinate and poor accuracy in classifying logical fallacies.
This limitation stems from their default System 1 processing, which is fast and
intuitive, whereas reliable reasoning requires the deliberate, effortful System
2 approach (Kahneman, 2011; Li et al., 2025). Since full System 2 training is
often prohibitively expensive, we explore a low-cost, instruction-based
intervention to bridge this gap. Our methodology introduces a novel stepwise
instruction dataset that decomposes fallacy classification into a series of
atomic procedural steps (simple binary questions). We further augment this with
a final verification step where models consult a relational knowledge graph of
related fallacies. This procedural, rule-based intervention yields a
significant improvement in LLM logical fallacy classification. Crucially, the
approach also provides enhanced transparency into the LLMs' decision-making,
highlighting a practical pathway for Neuro-symbolic architectures to address
LLM reasoning deficits.

### [307] [Deliberative Dynamics and Value Alignment in LLM Debates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10002)
*Pratik S. Sachdeva,Tom van Nuenen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper examines how large language models (LLMs) exhibit different moral reasoning behaviors in multi-turn debates compared to single-turn settings, using Reddit's 'Am I the Asshole' dilemmas to study value alignment through synchronous and round-robin deliberation formats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly used in sensitive contexts like personal advice and moral guidance, understanding their value alignment in multi-turn interactions is crucial, since most current evaluations focus only on single-turn prompts.

Method: Used LLM debates with GPT-4.1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash to assign blame in 1,000 Reddit dilemmas, employing both synchronous (parallel responses) and round-robin (sequential responses) formats to test order effects and verdict revision.

Result: Found striking behavioral differences: GPT showed strong inertia (0.6-3.1% revision rates) while Claude and Gemini were more flexible (28-41%). Value patterns diverged - GPT emphasized personal autonomy, while Claude and Gemini prioritized empathy. Deliberation format strongly impacted behavior, with GPT and Gemini showing high conformity to order effects.

Conclusion: Sociotechnical alignment depends on how systems structure dialogue, not just their outputs, as deliberation format and model-specific behaviors significantly shape moral reasoning in multi-turn interactions.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive
everyday contexts - offering personal advice, mental health support, and moral
guidance - understanding their elicited values in navigating complex moral
reasoning is essential. Most evaluations study this sociotechnical alignment
through single-turn prompts, but it is unclear if these findings extend to
multi-turn settings where values emerge through dialogue, revision, and
consensus. We address this gap using LLM debate to examine deliberative
dynamics and value alignment in multi-turn settings by prompting subsets of
three models (GPT-4.1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) to collectively
assign blame in 1,000 everyday dilemmas from Reddit's "Am I the Asshole"
community. We use both synchronous (parallel responses) and round-robin
(sequential responses) formats to test order effects and verdict revision. Our
findings show striking behavioral differences. In the synchronous setting, GPT
showed strong inertia (0.6-3.1% revision rates) while Claude and Gemini were
far more flexible (28-41%). Value patterns also diverged: GPT emphasized
personal autonomy and direct communication, while Claude and Gemini prioritized
empathetic dialogue. Certain values proved especially effective at driving
verdict changes. We further find that deliberation format had a strong impact
on model behavior: GPT and Gemini stood out as highly conforming relative to
Claude, with their verdict behavior strongly shaped by order effects. These
results show how deliberation format and model-specific behaviors shape moral
reasoning in multi-turn interactions, underscoring that sociotechnical
alignment depends on how systems structure dialogue as much as on their
outputs.

*Meng Xi,Sihan Lv,Yechen Jin,Guanjie Cheng,Naibo Wang,Ying Li,Jianwei Yin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RIPRAG is a black-box poisoning attack framework that uses reinforcement learning to generate poisoned documents that manipulate RAG systems' outputs, achieving significantly higher attack success rates than baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG attack research focuses on white-box attacks against simplified architectures, but real-world scenarios involve complex RAG systems where attackers lack internal knowledge.

Method: Proposed RIPRAG framework uses reinforcement learning to optimize poisoned document generation, treating the target RAG system as a black box with only success/failure feedback.

Result: Achieved up to 0.72 improvement in attack success rate compared to baseline methods, demonstrating effectiveness against most complex RAG systems.

Conclusion: The attack reveals significant vulnerabilities in current RAG defenses and provides critical insights for improving LLM security.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems based on Large Language Models
(LLMs) have become a core technology for tasks such as question-answering (QA)
and content generation. However, by injecting poisoned documents into the
database of RAG systems, attackers can manipulate LLMs to generate text that
aligns with their intended preferences. Existing research has primarily focused
on white-box attacks against simplified RAG architectures. In this paper, we
investigate a more complex and realistic scenario: the attacker lacks knowledge
of the RAG system's internal composition and implementation details, and the
RAG system comprises components beyond a mere retriever. Specifically, we
propose the RIPRAG attack framework, an end-to-end attack pipeline that treats
the target RAG system as a black box, where the only information accessible to
the attacker is whether the poisoning succeeds. Our method leverages
Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize the generation model for poisoned
documents, ensuring that the generated poisoned document aligns with the target
RAG system's preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that this method can
effectively execute poisoning attacks against most complex RAG systems,
achieving an attack success rate (ASR) improvement of up to 0.72 compared to
baseline methods. This highlights prevalent deficiencies in current defensive
methods and provides critical insights for LLM security research.

TL;DR: The paper proposes CE-Graph, a new paradigm for optimizing LLM-based workflows by minimizing Expected Failure Mass in Failure Signature Space, moving from scalar optimization to distributional failure analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional workflow optimization suffers from information collapse by reducing multi-step execution traces to simple success/failure signals, preventing modeling of failure distributions.

Method: CE-Graph framework approximates failure distributions from counterexamples, identifies dense failure regions as recurring modes, and applies targeted graph edits via Propose-and-Verify mechanism to reduce failure mass.

Result: On math, code, and QA benchmarks, CE-Graph achieves higher robustness at significantly lower cost than strong baselines.

Conclusion: System reliability emerges from systematically learning and reshaping the geometric structure of failure distributions rather than avoiding failures.

Abstract: Optimizing LLM-based workflows is typically formulated as a global search,
where candidate workflows are evaluated based on a scalar metric. This
paradigm, however, suffers from a critical flaw: information collapse. By
reducing rich, multi-step execution traces to simple success/failure signals,
existing methods are rendered blind to the underlying structure of failures,
fundamentally preventing them from modeling the workflow's failure
distribution. We reconceptualize this challenge as a distributional problem. We
propose a new paradigm where the optimization goal is not to maximize a scalar
score, but to directly minimize a workflow's Expected Failure Mass, i.e., the
integral of its failure probability density function defined over a
high-dimensional Failure Signature Space (FSS). This distributional lens allows
us to move from inefficient, zero-order optimization to a principled,
gradient-like descent on the failure landscape itself. We introduce CE-Graph, a
framework that operationalizes this paradigm through a novel, failure-driven
refinement process. CE-Graph approximates the failure distribution from a pool
of counterexamples, identifies its densest regions as recurring failure modes,
and applies targeted, operator-constrained graph edits via a Propose-and-Verify
mechanism to greedily reduce the failure mass. On math, code, and QA
benchmarks, our CE-Graph achieves higher robustness at a significantly lower
cost than strong baselines. This suggests that a system's reliability emerges
not from avoiding failures, but from systematically learning and reshaping the
geometric structure of its failure distributions.

### [310] [Belief Graphs with Reasoning Zones: Structure, Dynamics, and Epistemic Activation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10042)
*Saleh Nikooroo,Thomas Engel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A graph-based framework separates source credibility from network-induced confidence, enabling local reasoning in globally inconsistent belief systems through structurally balanced "reasoning zones" where classical inference remains valid.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge that belief systems are rarely globally consistent but can still support effective local reasoning, by separating external source credibility from internal network-induced confidence.

Method: Uses directed, signed, weighted graphs where beliefs are nodes and edges encode support/contradiction. Confidence is computed via contractive propagation. Identifies reasoning zones as high-confidence, structurally balanced subgraphs using parity-based coloring and greedy repair with Jaccard de-duplication.

Result: Provides a near-linear procedure for zone identification and recovery, with shock updates that enable localized belief change without destabilizing the entire graph. Empirical evaluation on synthetic graphs shows zone recovery and stability.

Conclusion: Establishes a principled foundation for contradiction-tolerant reasoning that activates classical logic precisely where network structure supports it, enabling robust local inference despite global inconsistencies.

Abstract: Belief systems are rarely globally consistent, yet effective reasoning often
persists locally. We propose a novel graph-theoretic framework that cleanly
separates credibility--external, a priori trust in sources--from confidence--an
internal, emergent valuation induced by network structure. Beliefs are nodes in
a directed, signed, weighted graph whose edges encode support and
contradiction. Confidence is obtained by a contractive propagation process that
mixes a stated prior with structure-aware influence and guarantees a unique,
stable solution. Within this dynamics, we define reasoning zones:
high-confidence, structurally balanced subgraphs on which classical inference
is safe despite global contradictions. We provide a near-linear procedure that
seeds zones by confidence, tests balance using a parity-based coloring, and
applies a greedy, locality-preserving repair with Jaccard de-duplication to
build a compact atlas. To model belief change, we introduce shock updates that
locally downscale support and elevate targeted contradictions while preserving
contractivity via a simple backtracking rule. Re-propagation yields localized
reconfiguration-zones may shrink, split, or collapse--without destabilizing the
entire graph. We outline an empirical protocol on synthetic signed graphs with
planted zones, reporting zone recovery, stability under shocks, and runtime.
The result is a principled foundation for contradiction-tolerant reasoning that
activates classical logic precisely where structure supports it.

TL;DR: SwarmSys is a distributed multi-agent reasoning framework inspired by swarm intelligence that uses three specialized roles (Explorers, Workers, Validators) in iterative cycles to achieve scalable and adaptive collaboration without centralized control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent frameworks rely on fixed roles or centralized control, limiting scalability and adaptability in long-horizon reasoning tasks.

Method: Uses three specialized roles (Explorers, Workers, Validators) in iterative cycles with adaptive agent/event profiles, embedding-based probabilistic matching, and pheromone-inspired reinforcement for dynamic task allocation and self-organizing convergence.

Result: Outperforms baselines across symbolic reasoning, research synthesis, and scientific programming tasks, improving both accuracy and reasoning stability.

Conclusion: Swarm-inspired coordination represents a promising paradigm for scalable, robust, and adaptive multi-agent reasoning, suggesting coordination scaling may rival model scaling in advancing LLM intelligence.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable reasoning abilities.
However, existing multi-agent frameworks often rely on fixed roles or
centralized control, limiting scalability and adaptability in long-horizon
reasoning. We introduce SwarmSys, a closed-loop framework for distributed
multi-agent reasoning inspired by swarm intelligence. Coordination in SwarmSys
emerges through iterative interactions among three specialized roles,
Explorers, Workers, and Validators, that continuously cycle through
exploration, exploitation, and validation. To enable scalable and adaptive
collaboration, we integrate adaptive agent and event profiles, embedding-based
probabilistic matching, and a pheromone-inspired reinforcement mechanism,
supporting dynamic task allocation and self-organizing convergence without
global supervision. Across symbolic reasoning, research synthesis, and
scientific programming tasks, SwarmSys consistently outperforms baselines,
improving both accuracy and reasoning stability. These findings highlight
swarm-inspired coordination as a promising paradigm for scalable, robust, and
adaptive multi-agent reasoning, suggesting that coordination scaling may rival
model scaling in advancing LLM intelligence.

*Zeyu Ling,Xiaodong Gu,Jiangnan Tang,Changqing Zou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SyncLipMAE is a self-supervised pretraining framework for talking-face videos that learns synchronization-aware facial dynamics from unlabeled audio-visual data using masked visual modeling, cross-modal contrastive alignment, and factorized prompt tokens for identity, vocal motion, and ambient motion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a unified framework that can learn transferable facial dynamics from unlabeled audio-visual streams and handle multiple downstream tasks requiring different capabilities, overcoming the limitations of task-specific approaches.

Method: Combines masked visual modeling with cross-modal contrastive alignment, using three per-frame prompt tokens to encode identity, vocal motion (speech-synchronized), and ambient motion (audio-agnostic). Uses time-aligned vocal-motion and audio tokens as positives and misaligned pairs as negatives to drive both modalities into a shared embedding space.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results across four disparate downstream tasks: audio-visual stream synchronization, facial emotion/action recognition, visual speech recognition, and visual dubbing. Enables indistinguishable audio- or video-driven control within a single model.

Conclusion: SyncLipMAE demonstrates the effectiveness of synchronization-aware, factorized self-supervised pretraining for learning transferable facial dynamics that can handle multiple downstream applications with distinct requirements.

Abstract: We introduce SyncLipMAE, a self-supervised pretraining framework for
talking-face video that learns synchronization-aware and transferable facial
dynamics from unlabeled audio-visual streams. Our approach couples masked
visual modeling with cross-modal contrastive alignment and employs three
per-frame prompt tokens that explicitly encode the essential factors of a
talking-face frame - identity, vocal motion (speech-synchronized facial
dynamics), and ambient motion (audio-agnostic movements such as blinks and head
pose). The contrastive objective uses time-aligned vocal-motion and audio
tokens as positives and misaligned pairs as negatives, driving both modalities
into a shared embedding space and yielding token-level audio-visual stream
synchronization. After pretraining, the aligned audio tokens together with the
visual prompt tokens (identity, vocal motion, ambient motion) form a unified
interface for four disparate downstream settings: (i) audio-visual stream
synchronization; (ii) facial emotion and head/face action recognition; (iii)
visual speech recognition; and (iv) visual dubbing, for which we enable
indistinguishable audio- or video-driven control within a single model. Across
four task families that require distinct capabilities, SyncLipMAE achieves
state-of-the-art results, underscoring the effectiveness of
synchronization-aware, factorized self-supervised pretraining.

TL;DR: StepFly is an end-to-end agentic framework that automates troubleshooting guide execution through a three-stage workflow, achieving ~94% success rate and significant execution time reduction for parallelizable TSGs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual execution of troubleshooting guides in IT incident management is slow and error-prone, while existing LLM-based solutions lack specialized support for TSG quality issues, complex control flow, data-intensive queries, and execution parallelism.

Method: Three-stage workflow: 1) TSG Mentor tool to improve TSG quality, 2) Offline preprocessing using LLMs to extract structured execution DAGs and create Query Preparation Plugins, 3) Online execution with DAG-guided scheduler-executor framework supporting parallel execution.

Result: Achieves ~94% success rate on GPT-4.1, outperforms baselines with less time and token consumption, and reduces execution time by 32.9% to 70.4% for parallelizable TSGs.

Conclusion: StepFly effectively automates troubleshooting guide execution through its structured approach, addressing key challenges in incident management and demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing solutions.

Abstract: Effective incident management in large-scale IT systems relies on
troubleshooting guides (TSGs), but their manual execution is slow and
error-prone. While recent advances in LLMs offer promise for automating
incident management tasks, existing LLM-based solutions lack specialized
support for several key challenges, including managing TSG quality issues,
interpreting complex control flow, handling data-intensive queries, and
exploiting execution parallelism. We first conducted an empirical study on 92
real-world TSGs, and, guided by our findings, we present StepFly, a novel
end-to-end agentic framework for troubleshooting guide automation. Our approach
features a three-stage workflow: the first stage provides a comprehensive guide
together with a tool, TSG Mentor, to assist SREs in improving TSG quality; the
second stage performs offline preprocessing using LLMs to extract structured
execution DAGs from unstructured TSGs and to create dedicated Query Preparation
Plugins (QPPs); and the third stage executes online using a DAG-guided
scheduler-executor framework with a memory system to guarantee correct workflow
and support parallel execution of independent steps. Our empirical evaluation
on a collection of real-world TSGs and incidents demonstrates that StepFly
achieves a ~94% success rate on GPT-4.1, outperforming baselines with less time
and token consumption. Furthermore, it achieves a remarkable execution time
reduction of 32.9% to 70.4% for parallelizable TSGs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DixitWorld evaluation suite assesses multimodal abductive reasoning in VLMs through dynamic multi-agent tasks (DixitArena) and static QA benchmarks (DixitBench), revealing trade-offs between generative creativity and discriminative understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of multimodal abductive reasoning in vision-language models are limited to static, single-agent tasks, failing to capture the dynamic, multi-agent nature of real-world reasoning.

Method: Created DixitWorld with two components: DixitArena (dynamic multi-agent environment for hypothesis generation and selection) and DixitBench (static QA benchmark isolating listener tasks).

Result: Smaller open-source models excel as creative storytellers but produce less discriminative clues, while larger proprietary models perform better overall, especially as listeners. DixitBench strongly correlates with listener performance.

Conclusion: There's a key trade-off between generative creativity and discriminative understanding in multimodal abductive reasoning, highlighting a central challenge for developing balanced vision-language agents.

Abstract: Multimodal abductive reasoning--the generation and selection of explanatory
hypotheses from partial observations--is a cornerstone of intelligence. Current
evaluations of this ability in vision-language models (VLMs) are largely
confined to static, single-agent tasks. Inspired by Dixit, we introduce
DixitWorld, a comprehensive evaluation suite designed to deconstruct this
challenge. DIXITWORLD features two core components: DixitArena, a dynamic,
multi-agent environment that evaluates both hypothesis generation (a
"storyteller" crafting cryptic clues) and hypothesis selection ("listeners"
choosing the target image from decoys) under imperfect information; and
DixitBench, a static QA benchmark that isolates the listener's task for
efficient, controlled evaluation. Results from DixitArena reveal distinct,
role-dependent behaviors: smaller open-source models often excel as creative
storytellers, producing imaginative yet less discriminative clues, whereas
larger proprietary models demonstrate superior overall performance,
particularly as listeners. Performance on DixitBench strongly correlates with
listener results in DixitArena, validating it as a reliable proxy for
hypothesis selection. Our findings reveal a key trade-off between generative
creativity and discriminative understanding in multimodal abductive reasoning,
a central challenge for developing more balanced and capable vision-language
agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based text-to-image generation struggles with maintaining consistent character identity across different prompts, which is crucial for applications like story illustration and animation.

Method: Built on a frozen diffusion backbone, CharCom uses prompt-aware control to dynamically compose LoRA adapters at inference time, allowing efficient per-character customization without retraining the base model.

Result: Experiments show CharCom significantly enhances character fidelity, semantic alignment, and temporal coherence in multi-scene narratives, while remaining robust in crowded scenes and enabling scalable multi-character generation with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: CharCom provides an effective solution for character-consistent story illustration that is well-suited for real-world applications, offering parameter-efficient customization and scalable multi-character generation.

Abstract: Ensuring character identity consistency across varying prompts remains a
fundamental limitation in diffusion-based text-to-image generation. We propose
CharCom, a modular and parameter-efficient framework that achieves
character-consistent story illustration through composable LoRA adapters,
enabling efficient per-character customization without retraining the base
model. Built on a frozen diffusion backbone, CharCom dynamically composes
adapters at inference using prompt-aware control. Experiments on multi-scene
narratives demonstrate that CharCom significantly enhances character fidelity,
semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. It remains robust in crowded scenes
and enables scalable multi-character generation with minimal overhead, making
it well-suited for real-world applications such as story illustration and

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PALU is a principled algorithm that formulates concise reasoning as a constrained optimization problem, reducing output length by 65% while improving accuracy by 15% across multiple domains and model scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for concise reasoning rely on hand-crafted heuristics that struggle to balance concision with performance and fail to adapt across domains and model scales.

Method: PALU formulates concise reasoning as a constrained optimization problem using Lagrangian optimization, with three practical approximations: off-policy rollouts for performance estimation, truncated Lagrange multipliers, and quantile-driven length adjustments.

Result: PALU reduces output length by 65% while improving accuracy by 15% when applied to DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B across five benchmarks, outperforming alternative methods and adapting across domains (logic, STEM, math) and model scales (1.5B, 7B, 14B).

Conclusion: PALU is a practical and effective concise reasoning approach that successfully addresses the limitations of previous heuristic-based methods through principled optimization and practical approximations.

Abstract: Concise reasoning in large language models seeks to generate only essential
intermediate steps needed to arrive at a final answer, thereby alleviating
issues of overthinking. Most proposed approaches hinge on carefully
hand-crafted heuristics, struggling to balance concision with performance,
often failing to adapt across domains and model scales. In this work, we
address these challenges by introducing a principled and pragmatic strategy,
performance-aware length updating (PALU). As a principled algorithm, PALU
formulates concise reasoning as a constrained optimization problem, minimizing
response length subject to a performance constraint, and then applies
Lagrangian optimization to convert it into a tractable unconstrained problem.
As a pragmatic solution, PALU streamlines complicated update rules through
three approximations: (i) estimating performance with off-policy rollouts, (ii)
truncating the Lagrange multiplier to two extremes, and (iii) replacing
gradient-based updates with quantile-driven length adjustments. PALU reduces
output length by 65% while improving accuracy by 15% when applied to
DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, averaged over five benchmarks, outperforming a
range of alternative methods. Furthermore, PALU is demonstrated to adapt across
both domain (logic, STEM and math) and model scale (1.5B, 7B, 14B) entrenching
the algorithm as a practical and effective concise reasoning approach.

*Qingni Wang,Yue Fan,Xin Eric Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAFER introduces a two-stage risk control framework for open-ended QA with LLMs, combining abstention-aware sampling and conformalized filtering to provide statistical guarantees without assuming finite solution spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing selective conformal prediction methods unrealistically assume finite sampling can obtain all admissible answers for open-ended QA, which lacks fixed solution spaces, making their guarantees unreliable in practice.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Calibrate sampling budget using Clopper-Pearson method with user-defined risk level, abstaining if risk cannot be met; 2) Apply conformal risk control to filter unreliable distractors from candidate sets using calibrated uncertainty thresholds.

Result: SAFER provides statistical guarantees for open-ended QA by controlling both sampling risk and filtering risk, while being compatible with various admission criteria and calibration-test split ratios.

Conclusion: SAFER offers a robust and data-efficient solution for trustworthy LLM deployment in risk-sensitive applications by addressing the limitations of existing methods in handling open-ended scenarios with unbounded solution spaces.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in risk-sensitive
applications such as real-world open-ended question answering (QA), ensuring
the trustworthiness of their outputs has become critical. Existing selective
conformal prediction (SCP) methods provide statistical guarantees by
constructing prediction sets with a constrained miscoverage rate for correct
answers. However, prior works unrealistically assume that admissible answers
for all instances can be obtained via finite sampling, even for open-ended QA
scenarios that lack a fixed and finite solution space. To address this, we
introduce a two-stage risk control framework comprising abstention-aware
sampling and conformalized filtering (SAFER). Firstly, on a held-out
calibration set, SAFER calibrates a sampling budget within the maximum sampling
cap, using the Clopper-Pearson exact method at a user-desired risk level (i.e.,
the maximum allowable miscoverage rate of the sampling sets). If the risk level
cannot be satisfied within the cap, we abstain; otherwise, the calibrated
sampling budget becomes the minimum requirements at test time. Then, we employ
calibration instances where correct answers are attainable under the calibrated
budget and apply the conformal risk control method to determine a statistically
valid uncertainty threshold, which filters unreliable distractors from the
candidate set for each test data point. In this stage, SAFER introduces an
additional risk level to guide the calculation of the threshold, thereby
controlling the risk of correct answers being excluded. Furthermore, we show
that SAFER is compatible with various task-specific admission criteria and
calibration-test split ratios, highlighting its robustness and high data
efficiency.

TL;DR: Environment Tuning is a novel training paradigm that enables LLM agents to learn complex tool-use behaviors directly from problem instances without expert trajectories, using curriculum learning, environment augmentation, and fine-grained rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches face challenges: SFT on synthetic data leads to overfitting, while standard RL suffers from cold-start problems and training instability. There's extreme scarcity of high-quality training data for complex multi-turn tool-use tasks.

Method: Environment Tuning uses structured curriculum, actionable environment augmentation for corrective feedback, and fine-grained progress rewards to enable stable and efficient exploration. It learns directly from problem instances without pre-collected expert trajectories.

Result: Using only 400 problem instances from BFCL benchmark, the method achieves competitive in-distribution performance and superior out-of-distribution generalization, overcoming the performance collapse common to SFT-based approaches.

Conclusion: This work presents a paradigm shift from supervised fine-tuning on static trajectories to dynamic, environment-based exploration, enabling training of more robust and data-efficient agents.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents show great promise for complex, multi-turn
tool-use tasks, but their development is often hampered by the extreme scarcity
of high-quality training data. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic data
leads to overfitting, whereas standard reinforcement learning (RL) struggles
with a critical cold-start problem and training instability. To address these
challenges, we introduce $\textbf{Environment Tuning}$, a novel training
paradigm that enables agents to learn complex behaviors directly from problem
instances without relying on pre-collected expert trajectories.
$\textbf{Environment Tuning}$ orchestrates this learning process through a
structured curriculum, actionable environment augmentation that provides
corrective feedback, and fine-grained progress rewards to ensure stable and
efficient exploration. Using only 400 problem instances from Berkeley
Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) benchmark, our method not only achieves
competitive in-distribution performance against strong baselines but also
demonstrates superior out-of-distribution generalization, overcoming the
performance collapse common to SFT-based approaches. Our work presents a
paradigm shift from supervised fine-tuning on static trajectories to dynamic,

TL;DR: PIXEL is a position-wise activation steering framework that learns property-aligned subspaces from dual views and selects intervention strength via constrained geometric optimization, enabling precise token-level control without global hyperparameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current activation steering methods for LLM alignment rely on coarse heuristics and lack principled approaches for determining where to steer and how strongly to intervene, limiting their reliability for trustworthy generation.

Method: PIXEL learns property-aligned subspaces from dual views (tail-averaged and end-token), selects intervention strength via constrained geometric objective with closed-form solution, performs sample-level orthogonal residual calibration, and uses position-scanning to identify receptive injection sites.

Result: PIXEL consistently improves attribute alignment across diverse models and evaluation paradigms while preserving model general capabilities, offering reliable and practical controllable generation.

Conclusion: PIXEL provides a principled and practical method for LLM activation steering with representation-level guarantees, enabling reliable behavior control without compromising model capabilities.

Abstract: Reliable behavior control is central to deploying large language models
(LLMs) on the web. Activation steering offers a tuning-free route to align
attributes (e.g., truthfulness) that ensure trustworthy generation. Prevailing
approaches rely on coarse heuristics and lack a principled account of where to
steer and how strongly to intervene. To this end, we propose Position-wise
Injection with eXact Estimated Levels (PIXEL), a position-wise activation
steering framework that, in contrast to prior work, learns a property-aligned
subspace from dual views (tail-averaged and end-token) and selects intervention
strength via a constrained geometric objective with a closed-form solution,
thereby adapting to token-level sensitivity without global hyperparameter
tuning. PIXEL further performs sample-level orthogonal residual calibration to
refine the global attribute direction and employs a lightweight
position-scanning routine to identify receptive injection sites. We
additionally provide representation-level guarantees for the
minimal-intervention rule, supporting reliable alignment. Across diverse models
and evaluation paradigms, PIXEL consistently improves attribute alignment while
preserving model general capabilities, offering a practical and principled
method for LLMs' controllable generation. Our code is available at

TL;DR: ADR is a dual-mode reasoning system that dynamically switches between fast and slow thinking modes based on complexity, achieving better performance with reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long Reasoning Models suffer from high computational costs and inference latency due to overthinking, creating a need for more efficient reasoning approaches.

Method: Two-stage training: (1) SFT with hybrid reasoning dataset for dual-mode capability, (2) RL with Entropy-guided Hybrid Policy Optimization (EHPO) for dynamic mode switching and effort optimization.

Result: Achieves up to 6.1% performance gain while reducing reasoning output length by 49.5% to 59.3% on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: ADR effectively balances reasoning performance and efficiency, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches with reduced computational overhead.

Abstract: Although Long Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved superior performance on
various reasoning scenarios, they often suffer from increased computational
costs and inference latency caused by overthinking. To address these
limitations, we propose Adaptive Dual Reasoner, which supports two reasoning
modes: fast thinking and slow thinking. ADR dynamically alternates between
these modes based on the contextual complexity during reasoning. ADR is trained
in two stages: (1) A cold-start stage using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to
equip the model with the ability to integrate both fast and slow reasoning
modes, in which we construct a hybrid reasoning dataset through a dedicated
pipeline to provide large-scale supervision. (2) A reinforcement learning stage
for optimizing reasoning effort, where we introduce Entropy-guided Hybrid
Policy Optimization EHPO, an RL training framework employing an entropy-guided
dynamic rollout strategy for branching at high-entropy units and a
difficulty-aware penalty to balance fast and slow reasoning. Across challenging
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ADR achieves an effective balance between
reasoning performance and efficiency among state-of-the-art approaches.
Specifically, ADR yields a performance gain of up to 6.1%, while reducing the
reasoning output length by 49.5% to 59.3%.

TL;DR: LLMs contain ultra-sparse critical neurons that, when disrupted, can cause catastrophic model collapse with perplexity increasing by up to 20 orders of magnitude. These neurons concentrate in outer layers and MLP down_proj components, and their disruption causes sharp phase transitions rather than gradual decline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent neuroscience findings that a small subset of biological neurons are crucial for core cognitive functions raises the question of whether LLMs similarly contain critical neurons that are essential for their performance.

Method: Proposed a Perturbation-based Causal Identification of Critical Neurons method to systematically locate critical neurons in LLMs through targeted disruption experiments.

Result: Found that: (1) LLMs contain ultra-sparse critical neuron sets whose disruption causes catastrophic model collapse; (2) Critical neurons concentrate in outer layers and MLP down_proj components; (3) Performance degradation shows sharp phase transitions rather than gradual decline.

Conclusion: These findings provide insights for developing more robust model architectures and improving deployment security in safety-critical applications, highlighting the vulnerability of LLMs to targeted neuron disruptions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational tools in natural
language processing, powering a wide range of applications and research. Many
studies have shown that LLMs share significant similarities with the human
brain. Recent neuroscience research has found that a small subset of biological
neurons in the human brain are crucial for core cognitive functions, which
raises a fundamental question: do LLMs also contain a small subset of critical
neurons? In this paper, we investigate this question by proposing a
Perturbation-based Causal Identification of Critical Neurons method to
systematically locate such critical neurons in LLMs. Our findings reveal three
key insights: (1) LLMs contain ultra-sparse critical neuron sets. Disrupting
these critical neurons can cause a 72B-parameter model with over 1.1 billion
neurons to completely collapse, with perplexity increasing by up to 20 orders
of magnitude; (2) These critical neurons are not uniformly distributed, but
tend to concentrate in the outer layers, particularly within the MLP down\_proj
components; (3) Performance degradation exhibits sharp phase transitions,
rather than a gradual decline, when these critical neurons are disrupted.
Through comprehensive experiments across diverse model architectures and
scales, we provide deeper analysis of these phenomena and their implications
for LLM robustness and interpretability. These findings can offer guidance for
developing more robust model architectures and improving deployment security in
safety-critical applications.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a lightweight plugin to reduce hallucinations in multimodal large reasoning models by identifying and regulating perception- and reasoning-oriented attention heads without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucination remains a persistent failure mode in multimodal large reasoning models, manifesting as erroneous reasoning chains and misinterpretation of visual content, which hinders their safe deployment in high-stakes applications.

Method: A two-step plugin: Functional Head Identification locates perception- and reasoning-oriented attention heads, and Class-conditioned Rescaling regulates their contributions without retraining.

Result: Evaluations on three real-world MLRMs show average improvement of 5% and up to 15%, with only <1% additional computation and 9% of baseline latency.

Conclusion: The approach is model-agnostic and significantly enhances both reliability and interpretability of off-the-shelf MLRMs, enabling safe deployment in high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) are rapidly advancing
vision-language reasoning and are emerging as a foundation for cross-modal
intelligence. Hallucination remains a persistent failure mode, manifesting
itself as erroneous reasoning chains and misinterpretation of visual content.
In this study, we observe that attention heads exhibit a staged division:
shallow heads predominantly serve perception, while deeper heads shift toward
symbolic reasoning, revealing two major causes of hallucination, namely
perceptual bias and reasoning drift. To address these issues, we propose a
lightweight and interpretable two-step plugin, Functional Head Identification
and Class-conditioned Rescaling, which locates perception- and
reasoning-oriented heads and regulates their contributions without retraining.
Evaluations on three real-world MLRMs (Kimi-VL, Ocean-R1, R1-Onevision), six
benchmarks across three domains, and four baselines show that our plugin
achieves an average improvement of 5% and up to 15%, with only <1% additional
computation and 9% of baseline latency. Our approach is completely
model-agnostic and significantly enhances both the reliability and
interpretability of the off-the-shelf MLRMs, thereby enabling their safe
deployment in high-stakes applications. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To navigate the complexities of Airbnb customer support operations by making policies and workflows more comprehensible to LLMs.

Method: Uses Intent, Context, and Action (ICA) format to restructure workflows and synthetic data generation for cost-effective fine-tuning of LLMs.

Result: Significantly enhances LLM performance in customer support, setting new benchmarks with improved accuracy and reduced manual processing time.

Conclusion: The approach is cost-effective and improves customer support, demonstrating the value of workflow restructuring and synthetic data in LLM applications.

Abstract: We propose a practical approach by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs)

support operations. In this paper, our methodology employs a novel reformatting
technique, the Intent, Context, and Action (ICA) format, which transforms

Additionally, we develop a synthetic data generation strategy to create
training data with minimal human intervention, enabling cost-effective
fine-tuning of our model. Our internal experiments (not applied to Airbnb
products) demonstrate that our approach of restructuring workflows and
fine-tuning LLMs with synthetic data significantly enhances their performance,
setting a new benchmark for their application in customer support. Our solution
is not only cost-effective but also improves customer support, as evidenced by
both accuracy and manual processing time evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the "inclusive innovation dividend" concept, arguing that healthcare AI solutions designed for diverse, constrained use cases generate superior economic returns in broader markets through market expansion, risk mitigation, performance dividends, and competitive advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While ethical arguments for fairness in healthcare AI are established, the economic and strategic value of inclusive design remains underexplored. The paper aims to demonstrate that inclusive healthcare AI development creates business value beyond compliance requirements.

Method: The paper draws from assistive technologies that evolved into mainstream industries and presents the Healthcare AI Inclusive Innovation Framework (HAIIF) - a practical scoring system that enables organizations to evaluate AI investments based on their potential to capture inclusive innovation benefits.

Result: The paper identifies four mechanisms through which inclusive innovation drives returns: market expansion, risk mitigation, performance dividends, and competitive advantages. HAIIF provides structured guidance for resource allocation to transform fairness into strategic differentiation.

Conclusion: Organizations investing incrementally in inclusive design can achieve expanded market reach and sustained competitive advantages, while those treating these considerations as overhead face compounding disadvantages as network effects and data advantages accrue to early movers.

Abstract: While ethical arguments for fairness in healthcare AI are well-established,
the economic and strategic value of inclusive design remains underexplored.
This perspective introduces the ``inclusive innovation dividend'' -- the
counterintuitive principle that solutions engineered for diverse, constrained
use cases generate superior economic returns in broader markets. Drawing from
assistive technologies that evolved into billion-dollar mainstream industries,
we demonstrate how inclusive healthcare AI development creates business value
beyond compliance requirements. We identify four mechanisms through which
inclusive innovation drives returns: (1) market expansion via geographic
scalability and trust acceleration; (2) risk mitigation through reduced
remediation costs and litigation exposure; (3) performance dividends from
superior generalization and reduced technical debt, and (4) competitive
advantages in talent acquisition and clinical adoption. We present the
Healthcare AI Inclusive Innovation Framework (HAIIF), a practical scoring
system that enables organizations to evaluate AI investments based on their
potential to capture these benefits. HAIIF provides structured guidance for
resource allocation, transforming fairness and inclusivity from regulatory
checkboxes into sources of strategic differentiation. Our findings suggest that
organizations investing incrementally in inclusive design can achieve expanded
market reach and sustained competitive advantages, while those treating these
considerations as overhead face compounding disadvantages as network effects
and data advantages accrue to early movers.

*Siddartha Devic,Charlotte Peale,Arwen Bradley,Sinead Williamson,Preetum Nakkiran,Aravind Gollakota*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Reasoning trace length serves as a simple and effective confidence estimator for large language models, performing comparably to verbalized confidence while being complementary.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address hallucination and reliability issues in LLMs by developing better uncertainty quantification methods, specifically exploring reasoning trace length as a confidence signal.

Method: Comprehensive experiments across multiple models, datasets, and prompts to evaluate trace length as a confidence estimator, investigating mechanisms through analysis of confounders like problem difficulty and GRPO-induced length bias.

Result: Trace length performs comparably to verbalized confidence estimators and remains effective even after adjusting for confounders. Reasoning post-training fundamentally alters the trace length-accuracy relationship, with high-entropy "forking" tokens playing a key role.

Conclusion: Reasoning trace length is a practical confidence measure for large reasoning models, and reasoning post-training enhances uncertainty quantification beyond verbal expressions.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification for LLMs is a key research direction towards
addressing hallucination and other issues that limit their reliable deployment.
In this work, we show that reasoning trace length is a simple and useful
confidence estimator in large reasoning models. Through comprehensive
experiments across multiple models, datasets, and prompts, we show that trace
length performs in comparable but complementary ways to other zero-shot
confidence estimators such as verbalized confidence. Our work reveals that
reasoning post-training fundamentally alters the relationship between trace
length and accuracy, going beyond prior work that had shown that post-training
causes traces to grow longer in general (e.g., "overthinking"). We investigate
the mechanisms behind trace length's performance as a confidence signal,
observing that the effect remains even after adjusting for confounders such as
problem difficulty and GRPO-induced length bias. We identify high-entropy or
"forking" tokens as playing a key role in the mechanism. Our findings
demonstrate that reasoning post-training enhances uncertainty quantification
beyond verbal expressions, and establish trace length as a practical confidence
measure for large reasoning models.

TL;DR: Traj-CoA is a multi-agent system that uses chain-of-agents to model patient trajectories from EHR data, addressing challenges of long and noisy temporal data through sequential processing and shared memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with temporal reasoning in electronic health records due to the long and noisy nature of patient trajectory data, requiring specialized approaches for effective modeling.

Method: Uses a multi-agent system with worker agents that process EHR data in chunks sequentially, distill critical events into a shared long-term memory module (EHRMem), and a manager agent that synthesizes summaries and timeline to make predictions.

Result: Outperformed baselines from four categories in zero-shot one-year lung cancer risk prediction using five-year EHR data, demonstrating clinically aligned temporal reasoning.

Conclusion: Traj-CoA establishes itself as a robust and generalizable approach for modeling complex patient trajectories, effectively handling the challenges of long and noisy EHR data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer a generalizable approach for modeling
patient trajectories, but suffer from the long and noisy nature of electronic
health records (EHR) data in temporal reasoning. To address these challenges,
we introduce Traj-CoA, a multi-agent system involving chain-of-agents for
patient trajectory modeling. Traj-CoA employs a chain of worker agents to
process EHR data in manageable chunks sequentially, distilling critical events
into a shared long-term memory module, EHRMem, to reduce noise and preserve a
comprehensive timeline. A final manager agent synthesizes the worker agents'
summary and the extracted timeline in EHRMem to make predictions. In a
zero-shot one-year lung cancer risk prediction task based on five-year EHR
data, Traj-CoA outperforms baselines of four categories. Analysis reveals that
Traj-CoA exhibits clinically aligned temporal reasoning, establishing it as a
promisingly robust and generalizable approach for modeling complex patient
trajectories.

Motivation: Existing medical AI systems process tasks in isolation without cross-validation and knowledge integration found in clinical teams, reducing their effectiveness in real-world healthcare scenarios where integrated diagnosis and treatment workflows are essential.

Method: Proposed MedCoAct framework that simulates clinical collaboration through specialized doctor and pharmacist agents with confidence-aware mechanisms, along with the DrugCareQA benchmark for evaluating integrated medical AI capabilities.

Result: MedCoAct achieves 67.58% diagnostic accuracy and 67.58% medication recommendation accuracy, outperforming single agent framework by 7.04% and 7.08% respectively. The approach generalizes well across diverse medical domains and is particularly effective for telemedicine and routine clinical scenarios.

Conclusion: The collaborative multi-agent approach transforms the isolation paradigm into a collaborative framework, providing interpretable decision-making pathways and demonstrating superior performance in integrated clinical workflows compared to single-agent systems.

Abstract: Autonomous agents utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in isolated medical tasks like diagnosis and image
analysis, but struggle with integrated clinical workflows that connect
diagnostic reasoning and medication decisions. We identify a core limitation:
existing medical AI systems process tasks in isolation without the
cross-validation and knowledge integration found in clinical teams, reducing
their effectiveness in real-world healthcare scenarios. To transform the
isolation paradigm into a collaborative approach, we propose MedCoAct, a
confidence-aware multi-agent framework that simulates clinical collaboration by
integrating specialized doctor and pharmacist agents, and present a benchmark,
DrugCareQA, to evaluate medical AI capabilities in integrated diagnosis and
treatment workflows. Our results demonstrate that MedCoAct achieves 67.58\%
diagnostic accuracy and 67.58\% medication recommendation accuracy,
outperforming single agent framework by 7.04\% and 7.08\% respectively. This
collaborative approach generalizes well across diverse medical domains, proving
especially effective for telemedicine consultations and routine clinical
scenarios, while providing interpretable decision-making pathways.

*Martina G. Vilas,Safoora Yousefi,Besmira Nushi,Eric Horvitz,Vidhisha Balachandran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Latent-Trajectory signals analyze internal model representations during reasoning to predict solution accuracy, enabling more efficient inference-time scaling with up to 70% token reduction while improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning models waste computation on unproductive paths during inference-time scaling. Reliably predicting which reasoning traces will succeed can substantially reduce wasted computation and improve efficiency.

Method: Introduce Latent-Trajectory signals that characterize temporal evolution of model's internal representations during reasoning generation. Measure overall change between start/end, accumulated intermediate changes, and advancement toward final state.

Result: Latent-Trajectory signals predict solution accuracy more reliably than cross-layer metrics and output-based confidence measures. When used for answer selection, reduce token usage by up to 70% while improving accuracy by 2.6% on average compared to majority voting.

Conclusion: Latent-Trajectory signals provide practical strategies for inference-time efficiency and offer interpretability insights into how reasoning processes are represented and differentiated in latent space, with predictive signals emerging early in reasoning traces.

Abstract: Reasoning models improve their problem-solving ability through inference-time
scaling, allocating more compute via longer token budgets. Identifying which
reasoning traces are likely to succeed remains a key opportunity: reliably
predicting productive paths can substantially reduce wasted computation and
improve overall efficiency. We introduce Latent-Trajectory signals that
characterize the temporal evolution of a model's internal representations
during the generation of intermediate reasoning tokens. By measuring the
overall change in latent representations between the start and end of
reasoning, the change accumulated across intermediate steps, and the extent to
which these changes advance toward the final state, we show that these signals
predict solution accuracy more reliably than both cross-layer metrics and
output-based confidence measures. When used to guide answer selection across
multiple sampled generations, Latent-Trajectory signals make test-time scaling
more effective and efficient than majority voting, reducing token usage by up
to 70% while preserving and even improving accuracy by 2.6% on average.
Moreover, these predictive signals often emerge early in the reasoning trace,
enabling early selection and allocation of compute to the most promising
candidates. Our findings contribute not only practical strategies for
inference-time efficiency, but also a deeper interpretability perspective on
how reasoning processes are represented and differentiated in latent space.

TL;DR: ELAIPBench is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' comprehension of AI research papers, featuring 403 expert-curated multiple-choice questions across three difficulty levels. The best LLM achieved only 39.95% accuracy, showing significant gaps in genuine paper understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to capture deep comprehension of full-length academic papers due to surface-level questions and unreliable metrics. There's a need to evaluate LLMs' ability to deeply reason about research content rather than just perform shallow retrieval.

Method: Developed ELAIPBench through an incentive-driven, adversarial annotation process by domain experts. Contains 403 multiple-choice questions from 137 AI research papers, spanning three difficulty levels and emphasizing non-trivial reasoning.

Result: Best-performing LLM achieved only 39.95% accuracy, far below human performance. Frontier LLMs with thinking modes or RAG systems failed to improve results and sometimes harmed accuracy due to overthinking or noisy retrieval.

Conclusion: There's a significant gap between current LLM capabilities and genuine comprehension of academic papers. Advanced features like thinking modes and RAG don't necessarily improve performance and can even degrade accuracy in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel at many domain-specific tasks, their
ability to deeply comprehend and reason about full-length academic papers
remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks often fall short of capturing such
depth, either due to surface-level question design or unreliable evaluation
metrics. To address this gap, we introduce ELAIPBench, a benchmark curated by
domain experts to evaluate LLMs' comprehension of artificial intelligence (AI)
research papers. Developed through an incentive-driven, adversarial annotation
process, ELAIPBench features 403 multiple-choice questions from 137 papers. It
spans three difficulty levels and emphasizes non-trivial reasoning rather than
shallow retrieval. Our experiments show that the best-performing LLM achieves
an accuracy of only 39.95%, far below human performance. Moreover, we observe
that frontier LLMs equipped with a thinking mode or a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) system fail to improve final results-even harming accuracy due
to overthinking or noisy retrieval. These findings underscore the significant
gap between current LLM capabilities and genuine comprehension of academic
papers.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified Intuition-Method Layered Model with Scope Extension that combines intuition-based rapid responses with method-based reasoning units, and expands applicability through vertical, horizontal, temporal, and spatial extensions organized into knowledge networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically address indirect (unseen) issues in LLMs by building on existing method-based reasoning and scope extension approaches, creating a more robust and extensible reasoning paradigm for real-world problem-solving.

Method: Proposes an Intuition-Method Layered Model where intuition provides rapid first-reaction answers, while method-based thinking decouples questions into transferable reasoning units. Scope extension includes vertical (cause analysis), horizontal (parallel/generalized issues), temporal, and spatial dimensions organized into systematic knowledge trees that form interconnected networks.

Result: The framework enables more systematic handling of unseen questions through organized knowledge networks and introduces the entropy of method extension as a quantitative measure of the system's capacity to solve novel problems.

Conclusion: By logically connecting existing approaches with new extensions and introducing an entropy-based evaluation framework, this work advances toward a more robust and extensible reasoning paradigm for LLMs in real-world problem-solving scenarios.

Abstract: Existing studies have introduced method-based reasoning and scope extension
as approaches to enhance Large Language Model (LLM) performance beyond direct
matrix mappings. Building on these foundations, this paper summarizes and
integrates these ideas into a unified Intuition-Method Layered Model with Scope
Extension, designed to address indirected (unseen) issues more systematically.
In this framework, intuition-based thinking provides rapid first-reaction
answers, while method-based thinking decouples questions and solutions into
transferable reasoning units. Scope extension is then applied to broaden
applicability, including vertical (cause analysis), horizontal (parallel and
generalized issues), and for the first time, temporal and spatial extensions,
which expand reasoning across time and contextual dimensions. These extensions
are organized into systematic knowledge trees that interconnect into a
knowledge network, thereby increasing adaptability. To quantitatively evaluate
this process, we propose the entropy of method extension, which measures the
independence and diversity of extensions as an indicator of the system's
capacity to solve unseen questions. By logically connecting existing approaches
with new extensions and introducing an entropy-based evaluation framework, this
work advances toward a more robust and extensible reasoning paradigm for LLMs
in real-world problem-solving.

*Ruolan Cheng,Yong Deng,Serafín Moral,José Ramón Trillo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new distance measure for random permutation sets based on a cumulative Jaccard index matrix, addressing limitations of existing methods while providing higher sensitivity and flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Measuring distance between permutation mass functions is crucial in random permutation set theory, but existing methods have limitations. The paper aims to develop a more effective distance measure that overcomes these shortcomings.

Method: The authors introduce a cumulative Jaccard index to quantify similarity between permutations, then propose a distance measure for RPSs based on the cumulative Jaccard index matrix. They analyze metric properties and provide correction schemes, with parameters for weight adjustment and truncation depth.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates natural top-weightiness (higher-ranked element inconsistencies yield greater distances), overcomes existing method limitations, is compatible with Jousselme distance, and shows higher sensitivity and flexibility in numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The cumulative Jaccard index-based distance measure provides an effective solution for measuring distances in random permutation sets, offering improved performance over existing methods while maintaining theoretical soundness and practical applicability.

Abstract: Random permutation set (RPS) is a recently proposed framework designed to
represent order-structured uncertain information. Measuring the distance
between permutation mass functions is a key research topic in RPS theory
(RPST). This paper conducts an in-depth analysis of distances between RPSs from
two different perspectives: random finite set (RFS) and transferable belief
model (TBM). Adopting the layer-2 belief structure interpretation of RPS, we
regard RPST as a refinement of TBM, where the order in the ordered focus set
represents qualitative propensity. Starting from the permutation, we introduce
a new definition of the cumulative Jaccard index to quantify the similarity
between two permutations and further propose a distance measure method for RPSs
based on the cumulative Jaccard index matrix. The metric and structural
properties of the proposed distance measure are investigated, including the
positive definiteness analysis of the cumulative Jaccard index matrix, and a
correction scheme is provided. The proposed method has a natural
top-weightiness property: inconsistencies between higher-ranked elements tend
to result in greater distance values. Two parameters are provided to the
decision-maker to adjust the weight and truncation depth. Several numerical
examples are used to compare the proposed method with the existing method. The
experimental results show that the proposed method not only overcomes the
shortcomings of the existing method and is compatible with the Jousselme
distance, but also has higher sensitivity and flexibility.

TL;DR: Proposes EA4LLM, an evolutionary algorithm method for training large language models, successfully training a 1B parameter model without gradients, challenging gradient-based optimization dominance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of gradient-based optimizers (Adam) which require high-memory GPUs and differentiable operations, excluding non-differentiable architectures from practical use.

Method: Evolutionary algorithms (EA4LLM) for optimizing LLMs, enabling training from pre-trained stage without gradient requirements.

Result: Successfully trained a 1-billion-parameter LLM using evolutionary algorithms, providing insights into EA effectiveness for neural network optimization.

Conclusion: Challenges gradient-based optimization as the only viable approach, potentially reduces computational costs, and enables participation of resource-limited groups in deep learning research.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress,
with model optimization primarily relying on gradient-based optimizers such as
Adam. However, these gradient-based methods impose stringent hardware
requirements, demanding high-concurrency, high-memory GPUs. Moreover, they
require all neural network operations to be differentiable, thereby excluding
many promising non-differentiable architectures from practical use. To address
these limitations, we propose a method for optimizing LLMs using evolutionary
algorithms (EA4LLM) and, for the first time, successfully demonstrate its
capability to train a 1-billion-parameter LLM from the pre-trained stage. We
conduct extensive experiments and provide key insights into how evolutionary
algorithms can effectively optimize neural networks. Our work challenges the
prevailing assumption that gradient-based optimization is the only viable
approach for training neural networks. It also holds significant potential to
reduce the computational cost of training large language models, thereby
enabling groups with limited computational resources to participate in deep
learning research.

TL;DR: A multi-agent reinforcement learning framework improves multimodal text-to-image generation by coordinating domain-specialized agents through PPO training and multimodal integration, achieving significant content enrichment and better semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal text-to-image generation struggles with maintaining semantic alignment and professional-level detail across diverse visual domains, necessitating more sophisticated coordination mechanisms.

Method: Multi-agent reinforcement learning framework with domain-specialized agents, using PPO training under composite reward function, contrastive learning, bidirectional attention, and iterative feedback between text and image modules.

Result: Significant content enrichment (1614% word count increase), reduced ROUGE-1 scores by 69.7%, Transformer-based fusion achieved highest composite score (0.521), multimodal ensembles showed moderate consistency (0.444-0.481).

Conclusion: Collaborative, specialization-driven architectures show promise for advancing reliable multimodal generative systems, though cross-modal semantic grounding challenges persist.

Abstract: Multimodal text-to-image generation remains constrained by the difficulty of
maintaining semantic alignment and professional-level detail across diverse
visual domains. We propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that
coordinates domain-specialized agents (e.g., focused on architecture,
portraiture, and landscape imagery) within two coupled subsystems: a text
enhancement module and an image generation module, each augmented with
multimodal integration components. Agents are trained using Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) under a composite reward function that balances semantic
similarity, linguistic visual quality, and content diversity. Cross-modal
alignment is enforced through contrastive learning, bidirectional attention,
and iterative feedback between text and image. Across six experimental
settings, our system significantly enriches generated content (word count
increased by 1614%) while reducing ROUGE-1 scores by 69.7%. Among fusion
methods, Transformer-based strategies achieve the highest composite score
(0.521), despite occasional stability issues. Multimodal ensembles yield
moderate consistency (ranging from 0.444 to 0.481), reflecting the persistent
challenges of cross-modal semantic grounding. These findings underscore the
promise of collaborative, specialization-driven architectures for advancing
reliable multimodal generative systems.

TL;DR: APLR (automatic piecewise linear regression) outperforms other machine learning methods in predicting student learning satisfaction, identifying key factors like time management, concentration, and peer helpfulness as most impactful.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern interpretable machine learning techniques haven't been sufficiently applied to study student learning satisfaction, despite its importance in education research.

Method: Used APLR (automatic piecewise linear regression) - a model combining boosting with interpretability - and compared it against several state-of-the-art approaches for predicting learning satisfaction.

Result: APLR provided the best fit for predicting learning satisfaction. Key findings: time management, concentration abilities, perceived helpfulness to classmates, and offline course participation had the most significant positive impact. Surprisingly, creative activities involvement didn't positively affect satisfaction.

Conclusion: APLR enables both global and individual-level interpretation of factors affecting learning satisfaction, allowing educators to customize instructions based on student profiles for improved educational outcomes.

Abstract: Although student learning satisfaction has been widely studied, modern
techniques such as interpretable machine learning and neural networks have not
been sufficiently explored. This study demonstrates that a recent model that
combines boosting with interpretability, automatic piecewise linear
regression(APLR), offers the best fit for predicting learning satisfaction
among several state-of-the-art approaches. Through the analysis of APLR's
numerical and visual interpretations, students' time management and
concentration abilities, perceived helpfulness to classmates, and participation
in offline courses have the most significant positive impact on learning
satisfaction. Surprisingly, involvement in creative activities did not
positively affect learning satisfaction. Moreover, the contributing factors can
be interpreted on an individual level, allowing educators to customize
instructions according to student profiles.

*Yi Zhang,Yushen Long,Yun Ni,Liping Huang,Xiaohong Wang,Jun Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A hybrid framework combining LLMs with mathematical optimization for ride-hailing platforms, achieving 16% improvement over state-of-the-art methods by using LLMs as meta-optimizers to generate adaptive high-level objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for ride-hailing platforms have limitations: RL approaches are data-inefficient and oversimplify real-world dynamics, while decomposed optimization methods lack awareness of low-level routing dynamics due to manually designed objectives.

Method: A training-free hybrid framework where LLMs serve as meta-optimizers generating semantic heuristics that guide low-level optimizers. These heuristics are refined through an evolutionary process using harmony search, adapting LLM prompts based on feasibility and performance feedback.

Result: Extensive experiments using New York and Chicago taxi datasets show the approach achieves an average 16% improvement compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM-optimization hybrid framework effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by leveraging LLMs' cognitive capabilities to bridge decomposition gaps while maintaining constraint enforcement through mathematical optimization.

Abstract: Online ride-hailing platforms aim to deliver efficient mobility-on-demand
services, often facing challenges in balancing dynamic and spatially
heterogeneous supply and demand. Existing methods typically fall into two
categories: reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, which suffer from data
inefficiency, oversimplified modeling of real-world dynamics, and difficulty
enforcing operational constraints; or decomposed online optimization methods,
which rely on manually designed high-level objectives that lack awareness of
low-level routing dynamics. To address this issue, we propose a novel hybrid
framework that integrates large language model (LLM) with mathematical
optimization in a dynamic hierarchical system: (1) it is training-free,
removing the need for large-scale interaction data as in RL, and (2) it
leverages LLM to bridge cognitive limitations caused by problem decomposition
by adaptively generating high-level objectives. Within this framework, LLM
serves as a meta-optimizer, producing semantic heuristics that guide a
low-level optimizer responsible for constraint enforcement and real-time
decision execution. These heuristics are refined through a closed-loop
evolutionary process, driven by harmony search, which iteratively adapts the
LLM prompts based on feasibility and performance feedback from the optimization
layer. Extensive experiments based on scenarios derived from both the New York
and Chicago taxi datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
achieving an average improvement of 16% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UCAS introduces uncertainty-aware advantage shaping to improve RLVR by refining credit assignment using model uncertainty signals, addressing coarse-grained reward distribution and entropy collapse in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods like GRPO use uniform advantage signals across all tokens, overlooking the importance of uncertain high-stakes decisions during reasoning, leading to inefficient exploration and entropy collapse.

Method: UCAS is a model-free method with two stages: modulates response-level advantage using model's overall self-confidence, and applies token-level penalty based on raw logit certainty to encourage exploration of high-uncertainty paths while penalizing overconfident errors.

Result: Extensive experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks show UCAS significantly outperforms strong RLVR baselines across multiple model scales (1.5B and 7B), achieving higher rewards with greater reasoning diversity.

Conclusion: UCAS successfully mitigates entropy collapse and balances the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards for LLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has shown significant
promise for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). However, prevailing algorithms like GRPO broadcast a uniform advantage
signal across all tokens in a sequence. This coarse-grained approach overlooks
the pivotal role of uncertain, high-stakes decisions during reasoning, leading
to inefficient exploration and the well-documented problem of entropy collapse.
To address this, we introduce UnCertainty-aware Advantage Shaping (UCAS), a
model-free method that refines credit assignment by leveraging the model's
internal uncertainty signals. UCAS operates in two stages: it first modulates
the response-level advantage using the model's overall self-confidence, and
then applies a token-level penalty based on raw logit certainty. This dual
mechanism encourages exploration of high-uncertainty paths that yield correct
answers while penalizing overconfident yet erroneous reasoning, effectively
balancing the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Extensive experiments on five
mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that UCAS significantly outperforms
strong RLVR baselines across multiple model scales, including 1.5B and 7B. Our
analysis confirms that UCAS not only achieves higher rewards but also promotes
greater reasoning diversity and successfully mitigates entropy collapse.

operational flow, and core features of simpliflow, demonstrating its utility
through diverse use cases ranging from software development simulation to
real-time system interaction. A comparative analysis with prominent frameworks
like LangChain and AutoGen highlights simpliflow's unique position as a tool
optimized for simplicity, control, and speed in deterministic workflow
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to comprehensively evaluate synergistic reasoning across audio and visual modalities, often neglecting one modality or integrating them inconsistently.

Method: Created a large-scale benchmark with 1000 high-quality QA pairs from 628 diverse videos (seconds to 30 minutes), manually verified for correctness. Includes 13 question types covering temporal reasoning, spatial localization, counting, causal inference, and summarization.

Result: Evaluation reveals a significant gap between model performance and human reasoning, with open-source models lagging behind closed-source counterparts, highlighting the difficulty of genuine audio-visual reasoning.

Conclusion: OmniVideoBench will be released to foster development of MLLMs with stronger and more generalizable reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
substantial potential in video understanding. However, existing benchmarks fail
to comprehensively evaluate synergistic reasoning capabilities across audio and
visual modalities, often neglecting either one of the modalities or integrating
them in a logically inconsistent manner. To bridge this gap, we introduce
OmniVideoBench, a large-scale and rigorously designed benchmark dedicated to
assessing synergistic audio-visual understanding, with a strong emphasis on
modality complementarity and logical consistency. Specifically, OmniVideoBench
comprises 1000 high-quality question-answer(QA) pairs, each annotated with
step-by-step reasoning traces, derived from 628 diverse videos ranging from
several seconds to 30 minutes, and manually verified to guarantee complete
correctness and uniqueness. Moreover, OmniVideoBench encompasses 13 carefully
designed question types, covering temporal reasoning, spatial localization,
counting, causal inference, summarization, and beyond, thereby capturing the
essential challenges of video understanding. Evaluation of multiple MLLMs on
OmniVideoBench reveals a pronounced gap between model performance and human
reasoning, with open-source models lagging significantly behind their
closed-source counterparts, underscoring the inherent difficulty of genuine
audio-visual reasoning. We will release OmniVideoBench to foster the
development of MLLMs with stronger and more generalizable reasoning
capabilities.

*Yang Xu,Shuwei Chen,Jun Liu,Feng Cao,Xingxing He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents the Extended Triangular Method (ETM), a generalized contradiction-construction algorithm that formalizes contradiction separation theory for automated reasoning, serving as the core of several high-performance theorem provers with competitive results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reasoning calculi based on binary resolution limit deductive synergy among multiple clauses, and while the Contradiction Separation Extension (CSE) framework provided theoretical foundation in 2018, its algorithmic realization remained unformalized.

Method: Extended Triangular Method (ETM) - a generalized contradiction-construction algorithm that formalizes contradiction separation mechanisms within a triangular geometric framework supporting flexible clause interaction and dynamic synergy.

Result: ETM serves as the algorithmic core of theorem provers (CSE, CSE-E, CSI-E, CSI-Enig) that achieved competitive results in standard first-order benchmarks (TPTP problem sets and CASC 2018-2015), validating the approach's effectiveness and generality.

Conclusion: ETM bridges theoretical abstraction and operational implementation, advancing contradiction separation into a generalized, scalable, and practically competitive model for automated reasoning, offering new research directions in logical inference and theorem proving.

Abstract: Automated deduction lies at the core of Artificial Intelligence (AI),
underpinning theorem proving, formal verification, and logical reasoning.
Despite decades of progress, reconciling deductive completeness with
computational efficiency remains an enduring challenge. Traditional reasoning
calculi, grounded in binary resolution, restrict inference to pairwise clause
interactions and thereby limit deductive synergy among multiple clauses. The
Contradiction Separation Extension (CSE) framework, introduced in 2018,
proposed a dynamic multi-clause reasoning theory that redefined logical
inference as a process of contradiction separation rather than sequential
resolution. While that work established the theoretical foundation, its
algorithmic realization remained unformalized and unpublished. This work
presents the Extended Triangular Method (ETM), a generalized
contradiction-construction algorithm that formalizes and extends the internal
mechanisms of contradiction separation. The ETM unifies multiple
contradiction-building strategies, including the earlier Standard Extension
method, within a triangular geometric framework that supports flexible clause
interaction and dynamic synergy. ETM serves as the algorithmic core of several
high-performance theorem provers, CSE, CSE-E, CSI-E, and CSI-Enig, whose
competitive results in standard first-order benchmarks (TPTP problem sets and
CASC 2018-2015) empirically validate the effectiveness and generality of the
proposed approach. By bridging theoretical abstraction and operational
implementation, ETM advances the contradiction separation paradigm into a
generalized, scalable, and practically competitive model for automated
reasoning, offering new directions for future research in logical inference and
theorem proving.

### [341] [Adaptive Selection of Symbolic Languages for Improving LLM Logical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10703)
*Xiangyu Wang,Haocheng Yang,Fengxiang Cheng,Fenrong Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive symbolic language selection method that improves LLM logical reasoning by choosing the most suitable symbolic language (first-order logic, logic programming, or Boolean satisfiability) for each problem type, achieving 96% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM logical reasoning approaches depend heavily on accurate NL-to-SL translation but overlook the crucial factor of selecting the optimal symbolic language type for different problem categories.

Method: Leverage LLMs to adaptively select the most suitable symbolic language (FOL, logic programming, or Boolean satisfiability) for each problem, then translate NL to the selected SL and use corresponding logical solvers.

Result: Achieves 96% accuracy on mixed benchmarks, improving performance by 25% compared to the second best approach (first-order logic translation only).

Conclusion: Adaptive symbolic language selection significantly outperforms single-SL and random-SL approaches, demonstrating that different logical reasoning problems require different optimal symbolic formalizations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle with complex logical reasoning.
While previous works achieve remarkable improvements, their performance is
highly dependent on the correctness of translating natural language (NL)
problems into a symbolic language (SL). Though numerous works focusing on
improving this translation accuracy, they only consider the similarity between
the meaning of SL and NL, overlooking another crucial influencing factor, the
selection of the target SL type itself. For example, first-order logic language
specializes in logical reasoning with categorical syllogisms and complex
quantifiers, while Boolean satisfiability formalism excels at representing
constraint satisfaction like partial problems. To our knowledge, this is the
first paper to claim and verify that different NL logical reasoning problem
corresponds to different optimal SL formalization for translation. Based on
this, we propose a methods to improve the logical reasoning performance of LLMs
by adaptively selecting the most suitable SL for each problem prior to
translation. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to select the target SL among
first-order logic, logic programming and Boolean satisfiability and then
translate the problem in NL to target SL expressions as well as employ the
corresponding logical solver to derive the final answer. Experimental results
on benchmarks show that our adaptive selection method significantly outperforms
translating all into single SL and randomly selecting the SL. On a mixed
dataset of these benchmarks, our approach achieves 96% accuracy, which
improving performance by 25% compared to the second highest accuracy from the
first-order logic translation.

### [342] [LLMs as Strategic Agents: Beliefs, Best Response Behavior, and Emergent Heuristics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10813)
*Enric Junque de Fortuny,Veronica Roberta Cappelli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit genuine strategic thinking with belief-coherent best-response behavior, emergent meta-reasoning, and novel heuristic formation in non-cooperative games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs display genuine strategic thinking (belief formation, action evaluation, and choice) beyond equilibrium play or reasoning depth, which remains unexplored in existing research.

Method: Developed a framework to disentangle beliefs, evaluation, and choice in static complete-information games; analyzed models' choices and reasoning traces; introduced context-free games to rule out imitation from memorization.

Result: Frontier models show belief-coherent best-response behavior at targeted reasoning depths; self-limit reasoning depth and form differentiated conjectures about human vs. synthetic opponents; under complexity, explicit recursion gives way to stable, model-specific heuristic rules distinct from human biases.

Conclusion: Belief coherence, meta-reasoning, and novel heuristic formation emerge jointly from language modeling objectives, providing a structured basis for studying strategic cognition in artificial agents.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to domains that require
reasoning about other agents' behavior, such as negotiation, policy design, and
market simulation, yet existing research has mostly evaluated their adherence
to equilibrium play or their exhibited depth of reasoning. Whether they display
genuine strategic thinking, understood as the coherent formation of beliefs
about other agents, evaluation of possible actions, and choice based on those
beliefs, remains unexplored. We develop a framework to identify this ability by
disentangling beliefs, evaluation, and choice in static, complete-information
games, and apply it across a series of non-cooperative environments. By jointly
analyzing models' revealed choices and reasoning traces, and introducing a new
context-free game to rule out imitation from memorization, we show that current
frontier models exhibit belief-coherent best-response behavior at targeted
reasoning depths. When unconstrained, they self-limit their depth of reasoning
and form differentiated conjectures about human and synthetic opponents,
revealing an emergent form of meta-reasoning. Under increasing complexity,
explicit recursion gives way to internally generated heuristic rules of choice
that are stable, model-specific, and distinct from known human biases. These
findings indicate that belief coherence, meta-reasoning, and novel heuristic
formation can emerge jointly from language modeling objectives, providing a
structured basis for the study of strategic cognition in artificial agents.

### [343] [DRIFT: Decompose, Retrieve, Illustrate, then Formalize Theorems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10815)
*Meiru Zhang,Philipp Borchert,Milan Gritta,Gerasimos Lampouras*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DRIFT is a framework that improves mathematical autoformalization by decomposing informal statements into sub-components for better premise retrieval from libraries like Mathlib, significantly outperforming baselines on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with formalizing mathematical statements due to difficulty identifying prerequisite knowledge and its formal representations. Current retrieval methods fail because informal statements are complex and lack context about underlying concepts.

Method: DRIFT decomposes informal mathematical statements into smaller sub-components to enable targeted premise retrieval from mathematical libraries, and also retrieves illustrative theorems to help models use premises effectively.

Result: DRIFT nearly doubles F1 score compared to DPR baseline on ProofNet, and shows strong out-of-distribution performance on ConNF with BEq+@10 improvements of 37.14% (GPT-4.1) and 42.25% (DeepSeek-V3.1).

Conclusion: Retrieval effectiveness in mathematical autoformalization depends on model-specific knowledge boundaries, requiring adaptive retrieval strategies aligned with each model's capabilities.

Abstract: Automating the formalization of mathematical statements for theorem proving
remains a major challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs struggle to
identify and utilize the prerequisite mathematical knowledge and its
corresponding formal representation in languages like Lean. Current
retrieval-augmented autoformalization methods query external libraries using
the informal statement directly, but overlook a fundamental limitation:
informal mathematical statements are often complex and offer limited context on
the underlying math concepts. To address this, we introduce DRIFT, a novel
framework that enables LLMs to decompose informal mathematical statements into
smaller, more tractable ''sub-components''. This facilitates targeted retrieval
of premises from mathematical libraries such as Mathlib. Additionally, DRIFT
retrieves illustrative theorems to help models use premises more effectively in
formalization tasks. We evaluate DRIFT across diverse benchmarks (ProofNet,
ConNF, and MiniF2F-test) and find that it consistently improves premise
retrieval, nearly doubling the F1 score compared to the DPR baseline on
ProofNet. Notably, DRIFT demonstrates strong performance on the
out-of-distribution ConNF benchmark, with BEq+@10 improvements of 37.14% and
42.25% using GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3.1, respectively. Our analysis shows that
retrieval effectiveness in mathematical autoformalization depends heavily on
model-specific knowledge boundaries, highlighting the need for adaptive
retrieval strategies aligned with each model's capabilities.

*Daniel Howard*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Framework for characterizing neurotic behaviors in embodied AI, including detectors and escape policies, plus destructive testing to expose systemic failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address internally coherent but misaligned AI behaviors that arise from interactions between planning, uncertainty handling, and aversive memory.

Method: Developed a grid navigation framework to catalog neurotic behaviors, created online detectors and escape policies, and used genetic programming for destructive testing to evolve adversarial scenarios.

Result: Identified 12 recurrent neurotic behavior modalities and showed that local fixes are insufficient for global failures; destructive testing reveals where architectural revisions are needed.

Conclusion: Neurotic behaviors in AI require systemic architectural solutions rather than symptom-level patches, and destructive testing can effectively expose these systemic weaknesses.

Abstract: We present a framework for characterizing neurosis in embodied AI: behaviors
that are internally coherent yet misaligned with reality, arising from
interactions among planning, uncertainty handling, and aversive memory. In a
grid navigation stack we catalogue recurrent modalities including flip-flop,
plan churn, perseveration loops, paralysis and hypervigilance, futile search,
belief incoherence, tie break thrashing, corridor thrashing, optimality
compulsion, metric mismatch, policy oscillation, and limited-visibility
variants. For each we give lightweight online detectors and reusable escape
policies (short commitments, a margin to switch, smoothing, principled
arbitration). We then show that durable phobic avoidance can persist even under
full visibility when learned aversive costs dominate local choice, producing
long detours despite globally safe routes. Using First/Second/Third Law as
engineering shorthand for safety latency, command compliance, and resource
efficiency, we argue that local fixes are insufficient; global failures can
remain. To surface them, we propose genetic-programming based destructive
testing that evolves worlds and perturbations to maximize law pressure and
neurosis scores, yielding adversarial curricula and counterfactual traces that
expose where architectural revision, not merely symptom-level patches, is
required.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A game-theoretic LLM-empowered multi-agent DRL framework that automatically synthesizes adaptive MAC protocols for wireless networks, achieving superior throughput and fairness without requiring retraining for dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MAC protocols are manually configured, while existing DRL-based approaches suffer from poor generalizability and resilience, requiring costly retraining to adapt to dynamic network environments with varying numbers of users.

Method: Models uplink transmission as a dynamic multi-follower Stackelberg game, uses LLM-driven agents coordinated through proximal policy optimization (PPO) to synthesize semantic MAC protocols, and employs protocol action grammar (PAG) to ensure reliability and efficiency.

Result: Achieves 77.6% greater throughput and 65.2% fairness improvement over conventional baselines, and generalizes excellently to fluctuating numbers of users without retraining or architectural changes.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully overcomes the limitations of traditional and DRL-based MAC protocols by providing adaptive, generalizable solutions that maintain high performance in dynamic wireless network environments.

Abstract: Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols, essential for wireless networks, are
typically manually configured. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based
protocols enhance task-specified network performance, they suffer from poor
generalizability and resilience, demanding costly retraining to adapt to
dynamic environments. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
game-theoretic LLM-empowered multi-agent DRL (MARL) framework, in which the
uplink transmission between a base station and a varying number of user
equipments is modeled as a dynamic multi-follower Stackelberg game (MFSG),
capturing the network's natural hierarchical structure. Within this game,
LLM-driven agents, coordinated through proximal policy optimization (PPO),
synthesize adaptive, semantic MAC protocols in response to network dynamics.
Protocol action grammar (PAG) is employed to ensure the reliability and
efficiency of this process. Under this system, we further analyze the existence
and convergence behavior in terms of a Stackelberg equilibrium by studying the
learning dynamics of LLM-empowered unified policies in response to changing
followers. Simulations corroborate that our framework achieves a 77.6% greater
throughput and a 65.2% fairness improvement over conventional baselines.
Besides, our framework generalizes excellently to a fluctuating number of users
without requiring retraining or architectural changes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PaperArena is a new benchmark for evaluating LLM agents' ability to answer real-world research questions requiring cross-paper reasoning and multi-tool orchestration, where current state-of-the-art agents achieve only 38.78% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing works are mainly restricted to tool-free tasks within isolated papers, lacking benchmarks for cross-paper reasoning and multi-tool orchestration in real research scenarios.

Method: Proposed PaperArena benchmark with modular platform offering tools like multimodal parsing, context retrieval, and programmatic computation to evaluate agents on research questions requiring integration across multiple papers.

Result: Most advanced LLM-powered agent system achieves only 38.78% average accuracy, dropping to 18.47% on hard subset. All agents exhibit inefficient tool usage, often invoking more tools than necessary.

Conclusion: PaperArena highlights significant room for improvement in scientific discovery agents and invites community adoption to develop more capable agents.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning on the web-scale scientific literature is a
crucial touchstone for large language model (LLM) based agents designed to
support complex knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing works are mainly
restricted to tool-free tasks within isolated papers, largely due to the lack
of a benchmark for cross-paper reasoning and multi-tool orchestration in real
research scenarios. In this work, we propose PaperArena, an evaluation
benchmark for agents to address real-world research questions that typically
require integrating information across multiple papers with the assistance of
external tools. Given a research question, agents should integrate diverse
formats across multiple papers through reasoning and interacting with
appropriate tools, thereby producing a well-grounded answer. To support
standardized evaluation, we provide a modular and extensible platform for agent
execution, offering tools such as multimodal parsing, context retrieval, and
programmatic computation. Experimental results reveal that even the most
advanced LLM powering a well-established agent system achieves merely 38.78%
average accuracy. On the hard subset, accuracy drops to only 18.47%,
highlighting great potential for improvement. We also present several empirical
findings, including that all agents tested exhibit inefficient tool usage,
often invoking more tools than necessary to solve a task. We invite the
community to adopt PaperArena to develop and evaluate more capable agents for
scientific discovery. Our code and data are available

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Proof-of-Use (PoU), a reinforcement learning framework that prevents Tool-Call Hacking in RAG agents by enforcing verifiable causal links between retrieved evidence, reasoning traces, and final answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address Tool-Call Hacking failure mode in RAG agents where agents inflate reward signals by making superficially correct tool calls without genuinely using retrieved evidence, leading to mode collapse and spurious grounding.

Method: Proposes Proof-of-Use (PoU) framework with unified step-wise contract combining syntactic citation validation, perturbation-based sensitivity rewards, and answer-evidence alignment objectives to ensure interpretable and functionally grounded tool usage.

Result: PoU consistently outperforms DeepResearch baselines across seven QA benchmarks in factual accuracy, evidence faithfulness, and tool-routing balance across in-domain, out-of-domain, and out-of-tool-distribution settings.

Conclusion: Grounding RL-trained agents not just in task outcomes but in the causal use of retrieved information is necessary for trustworthy retrieval-augmented reasoning, with PoU offering a principled solution.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) agents, such as recent
DeepResearch-style systems, extend large language models (LLMs) with autonomous
information-seeking capabilities through external tools. While reinforcement
learning (RL) has enabled impressive multi-step reasoning, we identify a
previously overlooked failure mode, Tool-Call Hacking, where agents inflate
reward signals by issuing superficially correct tool calls without genuinely
leveraging the retrieved evidence. This results in (i) mode collapse into
repetitive reliance on a single source and (ii) spurious grounding, where
answers are only weakly supported by cited content.
  To address this, we propose Proof-of-Use (PoU), an evidence-grounded RL
framework that enforces verifiable causal links between retrieved evidence,
reasoning traces, and final answers. PoU operationalizes this through a unified
step-wise contract combining syntactic citation validation, perturbation-based
sensitivity rewards, and answer-evidence alignment objectives, ensuring that
tool usage remains both interpretable and functionally grounded.
  Across seven QA benchmarks spanning in-domain, out-of-domain, and
out-of-tool-distribution settings, PoU consistently outperforms strong
DeepResearch baselines in factual accuracy, evidence faithfulness, and
tool-routing balance. These findings highlight the necessity of grounding
RL-trained agents not merely in task outcomes but in the causal use of
retrieved information, offering a principled path toward trustworthy
retrieval-augmented reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional keyword search and static embeddings fail to handle complex queries requiring contextual reasoning and multi-hop inference across distributed enterprise knowledge systems.

Method: Builds unified knowledge graphs from parsed repositories, integrates KBLam models, DeepGraph representations, and semantic search with dynamic query analysis to determine optimal retrieval strategies.

Result: Improves answer relevance by up to 80% compared to standalone GPT-based retrieval pipelines in experiments on large-scale Git repositories.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable, explainable, and user-centric foundation for intelligent knowledge assistants in enterprise environments through graph construction, hybrid reasoning, and interactive visualization.

Abstract: Modern enterprises manage vast knowledge distributed across heterogeneous
systems such as Jira, Git repositories, Confluence, and wikis. Conventional
retrieval methods based on keyword search or static embeddings often fail to
answer complex queries that require contextual reasoning and multi-hop
inference across artifacts. We present a modular hybrid retrieval framework for
adaptive enterprise information access that integrates Knowledge Base
Language-Augmented Models (KBLam), DeepGraph representations, and
embedding-driven semantic search. The framework builds a unified knowledge
graph from parsed repositories including code, pull requests, and commit
histories, enabling semantic similarity search, structural inference, and
multi-hop reasoning. Query analysis dynamically determines the optimal
retrieval strategy, supporting both structured and unstructured data sources
through independent or fused processing. An interactive interface provides
graph visualizations, subgraph exploration, and context-aware query routing to
generate concise and explainable answers. Experiments on large-scale Git
repositories show that the unified reasoning layer improves answer relevance by
up to 80 percent compared with standalone GPT-based retrieval pipelines. By
combining graph construction, hybrid reasoning, and interactive visualization,
the proposed framework offers a scalable, explainable, and user-centric
foundation for intelligent knowledge assistants in enterprise environments.

TL;DR: Video-STR is a graph-based reinforcement learning method for precise video spatio-temporal reasoning that addresses MLLMs' limitations in understanding physical information like multi-object layouts and motion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have strong semantic understanding but struggle with precise spatio-temporal reasoning, limiting their use in applications requiring high precision like embodied intelligence and VR.

Method: Proposes Video-STR using graph-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) method to guide models in inferring spatio-temporal topology, and introduces STV-205k dataset with 205k QA pairs covering dynamic multi-object scenes.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks, outperforming base model by 13% on STI-Bench, demonstrating effectiveness of the approach and dataset.

Conclusion: Video-STR successfully addresses spatio-temporal reasoning limitations in MLLMs through graph-based reinforcement learning and a comprehensive dataset, enabling better performance in precision-demanding applications.

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has demonstrated
strong semantic understanding capabilities, but struggles to perform precise
spatio-temporal understanding. Existing spatio-temporal methods primarily focus
on the video itself, while overlooking the physical information within the
video, such as multi-object layouts and motion. Such limitations restrict the
use of MLLMs in downstream applications that demand high precision, including
embodied intelligence and VR. To address this issue, we present Video-STR, a
novel graph-based reinforcement method for precise Video Spatio-Temporal
Reasoning. Building upon the capacity of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Reward (RLVR) to improve model abilities, we introduce a reasoning mechanism
using graph-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) method to guide the
model in inferring the underlying spatio-temporal topology of scenarios during
the thinking process. To resolve the lack of spatio-temporal training data, we
construct the STV-205k dataset with 205k question-answering pairs, covering
dynamic multi-object scenes in both indoor and outdoor environments, to support
the model training. Experiments show that Video-STR achieves state-of-the-art
results on various benchmarks, outperforming the base model by 13% on
STI-Bench, and demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach and dataset.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Model interpolation (simple weight averaging) surprisingly outperforms complex merging methods, following a three-stage evolutionary pattern that guides performance-cost trade-offs for efficient reasoning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically analyze the simplest model merging method (weight interpolation) and understand its dynamics for efficient reasoning, challenging the need for complex merging techniques.

Method: Direct weight interpolation between two models, with systematic analysis of the three-stage evolutionary pattern on reasoning trajectories and extensive ablation studies on layers, modules, and decoding strategies.

Result: Strategically interpolated models surpass sophisticated model merging baselines on both efficiency and effectiveness, with the three-stage dynamics providing principled guidance for performance-cost trade-offs.

Conclusion: Model interpolation is demystified as an effective approach that offers a practical framework for crafting models with precisely targeted reasoning capabilities, outperforming more complex merging methods.

Abstract: Model merging, typically on Instruct and Thinking models, has shown
remarkable performance for efficient reasoning. In this paper, we
systematically revisit the simplest merging method that interpolates two
weights directly. Particularly, we observe that model interpolation follows a
three-stage evolutionary paradigm with distinct behaviors on the reasoning
trajectory. These dynamics provide a principled guide for navigating the
performance-cost trade-off. Empirical results demonstrate that a strategically
interpolated model surprisingly surpasses sophisticated model merging baselines
on both efficiency and effectiveness. We further validate our findings with
extensive ablation studies on model layers, modules, and decoding strategies.
Ultimately, this work demystifies model interpolation and offers a practical
framework for crafting models with precisely targeted reasoning capabilities.

### [351] [FBS Model-based Maintenance Record Accumulation for Failure-Cause Inference in Manufacturing Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11003)
*Takuma Fujiu,Sho Okazaki,Kohei Kaminishi,Yuji Nakata,Shota Hamamoto,Kenshin Yokose,Tatsunori Hara,Yasushi Umeda,Jun Ota*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposed a Diagnostic Knowledge Ontology and FBS model-based method for accumulating maintenance records to improve failure-cause inference in manufacturing systems, especially in difficult cases with limited related cases and vocabulary differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for knowledge bases that explicitly structure system/failure knowledge and contain long causal chains to effectively identify failure causes in manufacturing systems.

Method: Constructed Diagnostic Knowledge Ontology and developed Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) model-based maintenance-record accumulation method.

Result: Failure-cause inference using proposed method showed better agreement with expert-enumerated candidate causes, particularly in difficult cases with few related cases and different vocabulary.

Conclusion: Approach leverages design-phase knowledge to support maintenance-phase problem solving, with potential to become foundation for knowledge sharing across entire engineering chain; future work includes developing tailored inference methods, building user interface, and validation on larger systems.

Abstract: In manufacturing systems, identifying the causes of failures is crucial for
maintaining and improving production efficiency. In knowledge-based
failure-cause inference, it is important that the knowledge base (1) explicitly
structures knowledge about the target system and about failures, and (2)
contains sufficiently long causal chains of failures. In this study, we
constructed Diagnostic Knowledge Ontology and proposed a
Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) model-based maintenance-record accumulation
method based on it. Failure-cause inference using the maintenance records
accumulated by the proposed method showed better agreement with the set of
candidate causes enumerated by experts, especially in difficult cases where the
number of related cases is small and the vocabulary used differs. In the
future, it will be necessary to develop inference methods tailored to these
maintenance records, build a user interface, and carry out validation on larger
and more diverse systems. Additionally, this approach leverages the
understanding and knowledge of the target in the design phase to support
knowledge accumulation and problem solving during the maintenance phase, and it
is expected to become a foundation for knowledge sharing across the entire
engineering chain in the future.

### [352] [Argumentation-Based Explainability for Legal AI: Comparative and Regulatory Perspectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11079)
*Andrada Iulia Prajescu,Roberto Confalonieri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper advocates for computational argumentation frameworks as the most suitable approach for explainable AI in legal contexts, addressing the black box problem by providing legally relevant explanations that align with regulatory requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems in legal contexts face opacity issues (the "black box problem") that undermine fairness, accountability, and trust, particularly as affected individuals lack meaningful explanations for automated decisions.

Method: The paper promotes computational models of arguments that capture the defeasible, contestable, and value-sensitive nature of law, analyzing different explanation strategies and their alignment with regulatory frameworks like GDPR and AIA.

Result: Argumentation frameworks are identified as offering a particularly robust foundation for explainable legal AI by providing legally relevant explanations that meet both technical and normative transparency requirements.

Conclusion: Computational argumentation is best positioned to address the challenges of explainable AI in legal domains, though open challenges remain including bias mitigation, empirical validation in judicial settings, and compliance with evolving standards.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly deployed in legal
contexts, where their opacity raises significant challenges for fairness,
accountability, and trust. The so-called ``black box problem'' undermines the
legitimacy of automated decision-making, as affected individuals often lack
access to meaningful explanations. In response, the field of Explainable AI
(XAI) has proposed a variety of methods to enhance transparency, ranging from
example-based and rule-based techniques to hybrid and argumentation-based
approaches. This paper promotes computational models of arguments and their
role in providing legally relevant explanations, with particular attention to
their alignment with emerging regulatory frameworks such as the EU General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA). We
analyze the strengths and limitations of different explanation strategies,
evaluate their applicability to legal reasoning, and highlight how
argumentation frameworks -- by capturing the defeasible, contestable, and
value-sensitive nature of law -- offer a particularly robust foundation for
explainable legal AI. Finally, we identify open challenges and research
directions, including bias mitigation, empirical validation in judicial
settings, and compliance with evolving ethical and legal standards, arguing
that computational argumentation is best positioned to meet both technical and
normative requirements of transparency in the law domain.

model, this paper conducts simulation-based comparisons of macroeconomic output
evolution in China and the United States under different mechanisms-AI
collaboration, network effects, and AI autonomous production. The results show
that: (1) when AI functions as an independent productive entity, the overall
growth rate of social output far exceeds that of traditional human-labor-based
models; (2) China demonstrates clear potential for acceleration in both the

analytical framework for understanding AI-driven production system
transformation and shifts in international competitiveness, as well as
quantitative insights for relevant policy formulation.

*Andrea Marinoni,Sai Shivareddy,Pietro Lio',Weisi Lin,Erik Cambria,Clare Grey*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a dynamic power management approach for AI data centers that makes input power as flexible as computing power, aiming to improve sustainability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI data centers consume massive amounts of power, creating environmental and sustainability concerns that require innovative power management solutions.

Method: The study investigates passive and active devices for dynamic power management, analyzing power trends from multiple global data platforms and comparing performance across computational gain, energy efficiency, capital expenditure, and management costs.

Result: The dynamic power management strategy shows potential to significantly improve AI hyperscalers' sustainability across environmental, financial, and societal dimensions.

Conclusion: This approach represents a paradigm shift in AI data center power management that could strongly enhance the sustainability footprint of AI infrastructure.

Abstract: The steady growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has accelerated in the
recent years, facilitated by the development of sophisticated models such as
large language models and foundation models. Ensuring robust and reliable power
infrastructures is fundamental to take advantage of the full potential of AI.
However, AI data centres are extremely hungry for power, putting the problem of
their power management in the spotlight, especially with respect to their
impact on environment and sustainable development. In this work, we investigate
the capacity and limits of solutions based on an innovative approach for the
power management of AI data centres, i.e., making part of the input power as
dynamic as the power used for data-computing functions. The performance of
passive and active devices are quantified and compared in terms of
computational gain, energy efficiency, reduction of capital expenditure, and
management costs by analysing power trends from multiple data platforms
worldwide. This strategy, which identifies a paradigm shift in the AI data
centre power management, has the potential to strongly improve the
sustainability of AI hyperscalers, enhancing their footprint on environmental,
financial, and societal fields.

*Chuke Chen,Biao Luo,Nan Li,Boxiang Wang,Hang Yang,Jing Guo,Ming Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARIA is a spec-driven framework that bridges the gap between analytical capability and research intent by enabling automated, interpretable data analysis through natural language specifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap between analytical capability and research intent, overcoming limitations of existing AI tools that favor automation over transparency or require manual scripting hindering scalability and reproducibility.

Method: Integrates six interoperable layers (Command, Context, Code, Data, Orchestration, AI Module) in a document-centric workflow that unifies human reasoning and machine execution through natural-language specifications.

Result: Achieved high predictive accuracy, rapidly identified optimal feature sets and suitable models, minimized redundant tuning. In Boston Housing case: discovered 25 key features, selected XGBoost as best model (R²=0.93) with minimal overfitting. Demonstrated strong performance, interpretability, and efficiency across heterogeneous domains.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for transparent, collaborative, and reproducible scientific discovery by combining AI for research and AI for science principles within a spec-driven architecture.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of scientific data has widened the gap between analytical
capability and research intent. Existing AI-based analysis tools, ranging from
AutoML frameworks to agentic research assistants, either favor automation over
transparency or depend on manual scripting that hinders scalability and
reproducibility. We present ARIA (Automated Research Intelligence Assistant), a
spec-driven, human-in-the-loop framework for automated and interpretable data
analysis. ARIA integrates six interoperable layers, namely Command, Context,
Code, Data, Orchestration, and AI Module, within a document-centric workflow
that unifies human reasoning and machine execution. Through natural-language
specifications, researchers define analytical goals while ARIA autonomously
generates executable code, validates computations, and produces transparent
documentation. Beyond achieving high predictive accuracy, ARIA can rapidly
identify optimal feature sets and select suitable models, minimizing redundant
tuning and repetitive experimentation. In the Boston Housing case, ARIA
discovered 25 key features and determined XGBoost as the best performing model
(R square = 0.93) with minimal overfitting. Evaluations across heterogeneous
domains demonstrate ARIA's strong performance, interpretability, and efficiency
compared with state-of-the-art systems. By combining AI for research and AI for
science principles within a spec-driven architecture, ARIA establishes a new
paradigm for transparent, collaborative, and reproducible scientific discovery.

### [356] [$How^{2}$: How to learn from procedural How-to questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11144)
*Gautier Dagan,Frank Keller,Alex Lascarides*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: How2 is a memory agent framework that enables AI agents to ask how-to questions, store answers, and reuse them for lifelong learning in interactive environments like Minecraft crafting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: How-to questions help agents reduce uncertainty and fill knowledge gaps for planning, but their open-ended nature makes them challenging for AI agents to ask and for AI experts to answer in ways that support efficient planning.

Method: How2 framework enables agents to ask how-to questions, store answers, and reuse them. Evaluated in Plancraft (Minecraft crafting environment) using teacher models that answer at varying levels of abstraction from executable actions to high-level subgoal descriptions.

Result: Lifelong learning agents benefit most from answers that are abstracted and decoupled from the current state. Abstract answers support better planning capabilities over time.

Conclusion: How2 offers a way for LLM-based agents to improve their planning capabilities over time by asking questions in interactive environments, with abstracted answers proving most beneficial for lifelong learning.

Abstract: An agent facing a planning problem can use answers to how-to questions to
reduce uncertainty and fill knowledge gaps, helping it solve both current and
future tasks. However, their open ended nature, where valid answers to "How do
I X?" range from executable actions to high-level descriptions of X's
sub-goals, makes them challenging for AI agents to ask, and for AI experts to
answer, in ways that support efficient planning. We introduce $How^{2}$, a
memory agent framework that enables agents to ask how-to questions, store the
answers, and reuse them for lifelong learning in interactive environments. We
evaluate our approach in Plancraft, a Minecraft crafting environment, where
agents must complete an assembly task by manipulating inventory items. Using
teacher models that answer at varying levels of abstraction, from executable
action sequences to high-level subgoal descriptions, we show that lifelong
learning agents benefit most from answers that are abstracted and decoupled
from the current state. $How^{2}$ offers a way for LLM-based agents to improve
their planning capabilities over time by asking questions in interactive
environments.

### [357] [Aligning Deep Implicit Preferences by Learning to Reason Defensively](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11194)
*Peiming Li,Zhiyuan Hu,Yang Tang,Shiyu Li,Xi Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CDRA reframes LLM alignment as structured reasoning to infer deep implicit preferences and enable defensive reasoning, addressing superficial responses through critique-driven methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM alignment methods fail to infer users' deep implicit preferences (unstated goals, semantic context, risk tolerances) and lack defensive reasoning for real-world ambiguity, leading to superficial and brittle responses.

Method: Proposes Critique-Driven Reasoning Alignment (CDRA) with two components: DeepPref benchmark (3000 preference-query pairs with critique-annotated reasoning chains) and Personalized Generative Process Reward Model (Pers-GenPRM) that generates critique chains for reward modeling, followed by Critique-Driven Policy Alignment using online RL.

Result: Experiments show CDRA excels at discovering and aligning with users' true preferences while executing robust reasoning.

Conclusion: CDRA successfully bridges the cognitive gap in LLM alignment by transforming it from scalar reward-matching into structured reasoning, enabling better preference inference and defensive reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Personalized alignment is crucial for enabling Large Language Models (LLMs)
to engage effectively in user-centric interactions. However, current methods
face a dual challenge: they fail to infer users' deep implicit preferences
(including unstated goals, semantic context and risk tolerances), and they lack
the defensive reasoning required to navigate real-world ambiguity. This
cognitive gap leads to responses that are superficial, brittle and
short-sighted. To address this, we propose Critique-Driven Reasoning Alignment
(CDRA), which reframes alignment from a scalar reward-matching task into a
structured reasoning process. First, to bridge the preference inference gap, we
introduce the DeepPref benchmark. This dataset, comprising 3000
preference-query pairs across 20 topics, is curated by simulating a
multi-faceted cognitive council that produces critique-annotated reasoning
chains to deconstruct query semantics and reveal latent risks. Second, to
instill defensive reasoning, we introduce the Personalized Generative Process
Reward Model (Pers-GenPRM), which frames reward modeling as a personalized
reasoning task. It generates a critique chain to evaluate a response's
alignment with user preferences before outputting a final score based on this
rationale. Ultimately, this interpretable, structured reward signal guides
policy model through Critique-Driven Policy Alignment, a process-level online
reinforcement learning algorithm integrating both numerical and natural
language feedback. Experiments demonstrate that CDRA excels at discovering and
aligning with users' true preferences while executing robust reasoning. Our
code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Zephyrian-Hugh/Deep-pref.

### [358] [AI Alignment Strategies from a Risk Perspective: Independent Safety Mechanisms or Shared Failures?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11235)
*Leonard Dung,Florian Mai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Analysis of failure mode correlations across 7 AI alignment techniques shows varying degrees of overlap, with implications for defense-in-depth strategies and research prioritization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI alignment techniques have failure modes, and defense-in-depth strategies rely on uncorrelated failures across multiple techniques to provide redundant safety protections.

Method: Analyzed 7 representative alignment techniques and 7 failure modes to understand the extent of their overlap and correlation.

Result: Found varying degrees of failure mode correlation across different alignment techniques, with some techniques sharing similar vulnerabilities while others have more independent failure modes.

Conclusion: The effectiveness of defense-in-depth depends on selecting techniques with uncorrelated failure modes, and research should prioritize developing complementary alignment approaches to maximize safety redundancy.

Abstract: AI alignment research aims to develop techniques to ensure that AI systems do
not cause harm. However, every alignment technique has failure modes, which are
conditions in which there is a non-negligible chance that the technique fails
to provide safety. As a strategy for risk mitigation, the AI safety community
has increasingly adopted a defense-in-depth framework: Conceding that there is
no single technique which guarantees safety, defense-in-depth consists in
having multiple redundant protections against safety failure, such that safety
can be maintained even if some protections fail. However, the success of
defense-in-depth depends on how (un)correlated failure modes are across
alignment techniques. For example, if all techniques had the exact same failure
modes, the defense-in-depth approach would provide no additional protection at
all. In this paper, we analyze 7 representative alignment techniques and 7
failure modes to understand the extent to which they overlap. We then discuss
our results' implications for understanding the current level of risk and how
to prioritize AI alignment research in the future.

*Deepeka Garg,Sihan Zeng,Annapoorani L. Narayanan,Sumitra Ganesh,Leo Ardon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PADME is a framework that transforms procedural text into executable graphs to enable robust execution of long-horizon tasks by LLM-driven agents, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-driven agents struggle with executing free-form instructions like recipes and protocols due to text variability and lack of structure, leading to execution drift and failure.

Method: Two-phase approach: Teach phase structures procedures into graphs with dependencies and executable logic; Execute phase enables dynamic execution with real-time feedback using the graph representation.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on four diverse benchmarks including ALFWorld and ScienceWorld, demonstrating robust execution across varying contexts.

Conclusion: Graph-based procedure representations provide a powerful intermediate abstraction for reliable agent-driven automation, reducing error accumulation in long-horizon reasoning.

Abstract: Learning to autonomously execute long-horizon procedures from natural
language remains a core challenge for intelligent agents. Free-form
instructions such as recipes, scientific protocols, or business workflows
encode rich procedural knowledge, but their variability and lack of structure
cause agents driven by large language models (LLMs) to drift or fail during
execution. We introduce Procedure Aware DynaMic Execution (PADME), an agent
framework that produces and exploits a graph-based representation of
procedures. Unlike prior work that relies on manual graph construction or
unstructured reasoning, PADME autonomously transforms procedural text into
executable graphs that capture task dependencies, decision points, and reusable
subroutines. Central to PADME is a two-phase methodology; Teach phase, which
focuses on systematic structuring, enrichment with executable logic of
procedures, followed by Execute phase, which enables dynamic execution in
response to real-time inputs and environment feedback. This separation ensures
quality assurance and scalability, allowing expert knowledge to be encoded once
and reliably reused across varying contexts. The graph representation also
provides an inductive bias that reduces error accumulation in long-horizon
reasoning, underscoring the importance of structured procedure modeling for
reliable agent-driven automation. Empirically, PADME achieves state-of-the-art
performance on four diverse benchmarks, including ALFWorld and ScienceWorld.
These results demonstrate that agents equipped with graph-based procedure
representations offer a powerful intermediate abstraction for robust and
generalizable execution.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The AI-Agent School (AAS) system uses self-evolving agents with a Zero-Exp strategy and continuous "experience-reflection-optimization" cycle to simulate complex educational dynamics, enabling more accurate modeling of teacher-student interactions and learning processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fragmented teaching process modeling and limitations in simulating diverse educational participants using LLM-based agents, by creating a more comprehensive simulation of educational systems.

Method: AAS employs a self-evolving mechanism with Zero-Exp strategy, continuous "experience-reflection-optimization" cycle, dual memory base (experience and knowledge bases), and short-term/long-term memory components for autonomous agent evolution in simulated school scenarios.

Result: Experiment confirms AAS can effectively simulate intricate educational dynamics and foster advanced agent cognitive abilities, generating high-fidelity behavioral and interaction data.

Conclusion: AAS provides a foundational stepping stone from the "Era of Experience" to the "Era of Simulation" by enabling more accurate modeling of nuanced educational interactions and processes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Agents are increasingly pivotal in
simulating and understanding complex human systems and interactions. We propose
the AI-Agent School (AAS) system, built around a self-evolving mechanism that
leverages agents for simulating complex educational dynamics. Addressing the
fragmented issues in teaching process modeling and the limitations of agents
performance in simulating diverse educational participants, AAS constructs the
Zero-Exp strategy, employs a continuous "experience-reflection-optimization"
cycle, grounded in a dual memory base comprising experience and knowledge bases
and incorporating short-term and long-term memory components. Through this
mechanism, agents autonomously evolve via situated interactions within diverse
simulated school scenarios. This evolution enables agents to more accurately
model the nuanced, multi-faceted teacher-student engagements and underlying
learning processes found in physical schools. Experiment confirms that AAS can
effectively simulate intricate educational dynamics and is effective in
fostering advanced agent cognitive abilities, providing a foundational stepping
stone from the "Era of Experience" to the "Era of Simulation" by generating
high-fidelity behavioral and interaction data.

*Le Ngoc Luyen,Marie-Hélène Abel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes an ontology-grounded evaluation framework for automated skill decomposition using LLMs, with semantic and hierarchy-aware F1 metrics, showing few-shot prompting improves stability and alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a rigorous, reproducible foundation for evaluating ontology-faithful skill decomposition systems using LLMs, addressing the need for standardized evaluation pipelines.

Method: Develops a framework with prompting strategies (zero-shot and leakage-safe few-shot), normalization, ontology alignment, and introduces semantic F1-score and hierarchy-aware F1-score metrics for evaluation.

Result: Zero-shot provides strong baseline performance, while few-shot consistently stabilizes phrasing and granularity, improves hierarchy-aware alignment, and shows competitive latency with more schema-compliant completions.

Conclusion: The framework, benchmark, and metrics provide a reproducible foundation for developing ontology-faithful skill decomposition systems, with few-shot prompting offering consistent improvements over zero-shot approaches.

Abstract: This paper investigates automated skill decomposition using Large Language
Models (LLMs) and proposes a rigorous, ontology-grounded evaluation framework.
Our framework standardizes the pipeline from prompting and generation to
normalization and alignment with ontology nodes. To evaluate outputs, we
introduce two metrics: a semantic F1-score that uses optimal embedding-based
matching to assess content accuracy, and a hierarchy-aware F1-score that
credits structurally correct placements to assess granularity. We conduct
experiments on ROME-ESCO-DecompSkill, a curated subset of parents, comparing
two prompting strategies: zero-shot and leakage-safe few-shot with exemplars.
Across diverse LLMs, zero-shot offers a strong baseline, while few-shot
consistently stabilizes phrasing and granularity and improves hierarchy-aware
alignment. A latency analysis further shows that exemplar-guided prompts are
competitive - and sometimes faster - than unguided zero-shot due to more
schema-compliant completions. Together, the framework, benchmark, and metrics
provide a reproducible foundation for developing ontology-faithful skill
decomposition systems.

*Beining Wang,Weihang Su,Hongtao Tian,Tao Yang,Yujia Zhou,Ting Yao,Qingyao Ai,Yiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DRM is a new supervision framework that evaluates reasoning processes along three interpretable dimensions (Confidence, Relevance, Coherence) to provide better training signals than outcome-only or process-level rewards, improving LLM reasoning across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods only reward correct final answers, propagating flawed reasoning with sparse rewards, while PRMs lack generalizability and require task-specific segmentation. There's a need for a more interpretable and generalizable approach to supervise reasoning processes.

Method: Proposed Dimension-level Reward Model (DRM) that evaluates reasoning quality along three fundamental dimensions: Confidence (uncertainty calibration), Relevance (semantic alignment), and Coherence (logical consistency). These provide interpretable assessment without requiring ground truth answers.

Result: DRM provides effective supervision signals that guide LLM optimization and enhance reasoning ability. It achieves consistent gains on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks across mathematics, question answering, code execution, and puzzles.

Conclusion: Multidimensional supervision of reasoning processes can improve the generalized reasoning ability of LLMs beyond the training distribution, demonstrating the effectiveness of interpretable dimension-level evaluation.

Abstract: Improving the multi-step reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
a critical yet challenging task. The dominant paradigm, outcome-supervised
reinforcement learning (RLVR), rewards only correct final answers, often
propagating flawed reasoning and suffering from sparse reward signals. While
process-level reward models (PRMs) provide denser, step-by-step feedback, they
lack generalizability and interpretability, requiring task-specific
segmentation of the reasoning process. To this end, we propose the
Dimension-level Reward Model (DRM), a new supervision framework that bridges
the gap between these two approaches. DRM evaluates the quality of a reasoning
process along three fundamental, complementary, and interpretable dimensions:
Confidence for uncertainty calibration, Relevance for semantic alignment, and
Coherence for logical consistency. Together, these dimensions capture aspects
beyond final answer correctness and enable interpretable assessment without
requiring ground truth answers. Experimental results show that DRM provides
effective supervision signals, guides the optimization of LLMs and enhances
their reasoning ability. In particular, DRM-supervised training achieves
consistent gains on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution open-domain
tasks, including mathematics, question answering, code execution, and puzzles.
Our findings demonstrate that multidimensional supervision of the reasoning
process can improve the generalized reasoning ability of LLMs beyond the
training distribution.

### [364] [Unifying Deductive and Abductive Reasoning in Knowledge Graphs with Masked Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11462)
*Yisen Gao,Jiaxin Bai,Yi Huang,Xingcheng Fu,Qingyun Sun,Yangqiu Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DARK is a unified framework that combines deductive and abductive reasoning in knowledge graphs using a masked diffusion model with self-reflective denoising and logic-exploration reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deductive and abductive reasoning have synergistic potential but are typically addressed separately. Deduction validates hypotheses while abduction uncovers deeper logical patterns, suggesting benefits from a unified approach.

Method: Uses a masked diffusion model with two key innovations: self-reflective denoising process for iterative hypothesis generation/validation during abduction, and logic-exploration reinforcement learning that simultaneously masks queries and conclusions to explore novel reasoning compositions.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark knowledge graphs show DARK achieves state-of-the-art performance on both deductive and abductive reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The unified approach of combining deductive and abductive reasoning in knowledge graphs demonstrates significant benefits and superior performance compared to isolated methods.

Abstract: Deductive and abductive reasoning are two critical paradigms for analyzing
knowledge graphs, enabling applications from financial query answering to
scientific discovery. Deductive reasoning on knowledge graphs usually involves
retrieving entities that satisfy a complex logical query, while abductive
reasoning generates plausible logical hypotheses from observations. Despite
their clear synergistic potential, where deduction can validate hypotheses and
abduction can uncover deeper logical patterns, existing methods address them in
isolation. To bridge this gap, we propose DARK, a unified framework for
Deductive and Abductive Reasoning in Knowledge graphs. As a masked diffusion
model capable of capturing the bidirectional relationship between queries and
conclusions, DARK has two key innovations. First, to better leverage deduction
for hypothesis refinement during abductive reasoning, we introduce a
self-reflective denoising process that iteratively generates and validates
candidate hypotheses against the observed conclusion. Second, to discover
richer logical associations, we propose a logic-exploration reinforcement
learning approach that simultaneously masks queries and conclusions, enabling
the model to explore novel reasoning compositions. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark knowledge graphs show that DARK achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both deductive and abductive reasoning tasks, demonstrating the
significant benefits of our unified approach.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CC-Gen is a benchmark generator for evaluating LLM agents' ability to internalize complex policy documents. The paper proposes CAP-CPT, a method that categorizes policies and uses targeted pretraining to reduce computational overhead while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based agentic systems face high computational overhead from expanding policy documents, motivating the need for internalization methods that embed policies into model priors while preserving performance.

Method: CAP-CPT (Category-Aware Policy Continued Pretraining) parses policy documents into factual, behavioral, and conditional categories, isolates complex conditions, and uses targeted data synthesis with autoregressive pretraining loss.

Result: CAP-CPT improves SFT baselines with up to 41% and 22% gains on Qwen-3-32B, achieving 97.3% prompt length reduction on CC-Gen and enhancing tau-Bench with minimal SFT data.

Conclusion: The proposed CAP-CPT method effectively internalizes complex policy documents, reducing computational overhead while maintaining or improving agent performance across different complexity levels.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems rely on in-context policy
documents encoding diverse business rules. As requirements grow, these
documents expand rapidly, causing high computational overhead. This motivates
developing internalization methods that embed policy documents into model
priors while preserving performance. Prior prompt compression work targets
generic prompts, but agentic policy documents span multiple complexity levels
and require deeper reasoning, making internalization harder. We introduce
CC-Gen, an agentic benchmark generator with Controllable Complexity across four
levels, enabling systematic evaluation of agents' ability to handle complexity
and offering a unified framework for assessing policy internalization. Our
analysis shows that complex policy specifications governing workflows pose
major reasoning challenges. Supporting internalization with gold user agent
interaction trajectories containing chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations via
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is data-intensive and degrades sharply as policy
complexity increases. To mitigate data and reasoning burdens, we propose
Category-Aware Policy Continued Pretraining (CAP-CPT). Our automated pipeline
parses policy documents to extract key specifications, grouping them into
factual, behavioral, and conditional categories, and isolating complex
conditions that drive workflow complexity. This guides targeted data synthesis
and enables agents to internalize policy information through an autoregressive
pretraining loss. Experiments show CAP-CPT improves SFT baselines in all
settings, with up to 41% and 22% gains on Qwen-3-32B, achieving 97.3% prompt
length reduction on CC-Gen and further enhancing tau-Bench with minimal SFT
data.

### [367] [Reproducibility: The New Frontier in AI Governance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11595)
*Israel Mason-Williams,Gabryel Mason-Williams*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI research needs stricter reproducibility standards to help policymakers create effective governance, as current low scientific standards create regulatory uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI policymakers face an information environment with low signal-to-noise ratio, favoring regulatory capture and creating uncertainty about which AI risks to prioritize for governance.

Method: The paper proposes adopting preregistration, increased statistical power, and negative result publication protocols from other scientific domains to improve AI research reproducibility.

Result: The analysis identifies a forthcoming reproducibility crisis in AI research that mirrors crises in other scientific fields, undermining effective governance.

Conclusion: While AI governance must remain reactive to societal impacts, policymakers should demand higher reproducibility standards as a core governance tool to improve consensus on AI risks.

Abstract: AI policymakers are responsible for delivering effective governance
mechanisms that can provide safe, aligned and trustworthy AI development.
However, the information environment offered to policymakers is characterised
by an unnecessarily low Signal-To-Noise Ratio, favouring regulatory capture and
creating deep uncertainty and divides on which risks should be prioritised from
a governance perspective. We posit that the current publication speeds in AI
combined with the lack of strong scientific standards, via weak reproducibility
protocols, effectively erodes the power of policymakers to enact meaningful
policy and governance protocols. Our paper outlines how AI research could adopt
stricter reproducibility guidelines to assist governance endeavours and improve
consensus on the AI risk landscape. We evaluate the forthcoming reproducibility
crisis within AI research through the lens of crises in other scientific
domains; providing a commentary on how adopting preregistration, increased
statistical power and negative result publication reproducibility protocols can
enable effective AI governance. While we maintain that AI governance must be
reactive due to AI's significant societal implications we argue that
policymakers and governments must consider reproducibility protocols as a core
tool in the governance arsenal and demand higher standards for AI research.

### [368] [Explainability, risk modeling, and segmentation based customer churn analytics for personalized retention in e-commerce](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11604)
*Sanjula De Alwis,Indrajith Ekanayake*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework combining explainable AI, survival analysis, and RFM profiling to create interpretable churn prediction models that enable personalized retention strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional churn models are opaque black boxes that limit insights into churn determinants, timing of retention opportunities, and identification of high-risk segments, while customer acquisition costs exceed retention costs.

Method: Three-component framework: 1) Explainable AI to quantify feature contributions, 2) Survival analysis to model time-to-event churn risk, 3) RFM profiling to segment customers by transactional behavior.

Result: The integrated approach enables attribution of churn drivers, estimation of intervention windows, and prioritization of segments for targeted retention actions.

Conclusion: Shifting focus from prediction alone to designing personalized retention strategies with interpretable evidence can reduce attrition and strengthen customer loyalty.

Abstract: In online retail, customer acquisition typically incurs higher costs than
customer retention, motivating firms to invest in churn analytics. However,
many contemporary churn models operate as opaque black boxes, limiting insight
into the determinants of attrition, the timing of retention opportunities, and
the identification of high-risk customer segments. Accordingly, the emphasis
should shift from prediction alone to the design of personalized retention
strategies grounded in interpretable evidence. This study advances a
three-component framework that integrates explainable AI to quantify feature
contributions, survival analysis to model time-to-event churn risk, and RFM
profiling to segment customers by transactional behaviour. In combination,
these methods enable the attribution of churn drivers, estimation of
intervention windows, and prioritization of segments for targeted actions,
thereby supporting strategies that reduce attrition and strengthen customer
loyalty.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ParaCook is a benchmark for evaluating time-efficient collaborative planning in multi-agent systems, inspired by Overcooked cooking tasks, designed to assess LLMs' ability to optimize parallel and asynchronous operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agent benchmarks focus on task completion but neglect time efficiency in parallel and asynchronous operations, which is crucial for real-world collaborative planning.

Method: ParaCook provides an environment with simplified action space for cooking tasks, enabling evaluation of strategic parallel planning in multi-agent systems with adjustable complexity.

Result: Current LLMs achieve suboptimal plans that struggle with parallel actions and coordination, but show potential on abstract tasks where they can focus on high-level parallel optimization.

Conclusion: ParaCook establishes a scalable evaluation framework for developing and assessing time efficiency-aware multi-agent planning, addressing a critical gap in current benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning abilities for planning
long-horizon, real-world tasks, yet existing agent benchmarks focus on task
completion while neglecting time efficiency in parallel and asynchronous
operations. To address this, we present ParaCook, a benchmark for
time-efficient collaborative planning. Inspired by the Overcooked game,
ParaCook provides an environment for various challenging interaction planning
of multi-agent systems that are instantiated as cooking tasks, with a
simplified action space to isolate the core challenge of strategic parallel
planning. Through a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, we find
that current approaches achieve suboptimal plans, which struggle with parallel
actions or coordination. Our analysis also reveals LLMs' potential on abstract
tasks where they can focus on high-level parallel optimization. ParaCook
provides a scalable evaluation framework with adjustable complexity,
establishing a foundation for developing and assessing time efficiency-aware
multi-agent planning. The code and data are available at

*Shijie Xia,Yuhan Sun,Pengfei Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SR-Scientist elevates LLMs from simple equation proposers to autonomous AI scientists that write code, analyze data, implement equations, and optimize them through experimental feedback, outperforming baselines by 6-35% across four science disciplines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based equation discovery methods limit LLMs to being equation proposers within search algorithms, failing to leverage their full potential as autonomous scientific agents.

Method: The framework wraps a code interpreter into tools for data analysis and equation evaluation, enabling the agent to autonomously write code, implement equations, submit for evaluation, and optimize based on feedback through long-horizon reasoning with minimal human pipelines.

Result: SR-Scientist outperforms baseline methods by 6-35% across four science disciplines, demonstrates robustness to noise, generalization to out-of-domain data, and symbolic accuracy. An RL framework further enhances agent capabilities.

Conclusion: Elevating LLMs to autonomous AI scientists through code-based tools and experimental feedback enables superior equation discovery performance and represents a significant advancement in AI-driven scientific discovery.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied to scientific
equation discovery, leveraging their embedded scientific knowledge for
hypothesis generation. However, current methods typically confine LLMs to the
role of an equation proposer within search algorithms like genetic programming.
In this paper, we present SR-Scientist, a framework that elevates the LLM from
a simple equation proposer to an autonomous AI scientist that writes code to
analyze data, implements the equation as code, submits it for evaluation, and
optimizes the equation based on experimental feedback. Specifically, we wrap
the code interpreter into a set of tools for data analysis and equation
evaluation. The agent is instructed to optimize the equation by utilizing these
tools over a long horizon with minimal human-defined pipelines. Empirical
results show that SR-Scientist outperforms baseline methods by an absolute
margin of 6% to 35% on datasets covering four science disciplines.
Additionally, we demonstrate our method's robustness to noise, the
generalization of the discovered equations to out-of-domain data, and their
symbolic accuracy. Furthermore, we develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning
framework to enhance the agent's capabilities.
