Despite offering advantages like negligible\ncomputational overhead and compatibility with black-box models, conventional VP\nmethods typically achieve lower accuracy than other adaptation approaches. Our\nanalysis reveals two critical limitations: the restricted expressivity of\nsimple additive transformation and a tendency toward overfitting when the\nparameter count increases. To address these challenges, we propose ACAVP\n(Affine, Color, and Additive Visual Prompting), which enhances VP's expressive\npower by introducing complementary transformation operations: affine\ntransformation for creating task-specific prompt regions while preserving\noriginal image information, and color transformation for emphasizing\ntask-relevant visual features. Additionally, we identify that overfitting is a\ncritical issue in VP training and introduce TrivialAugment as an effective data\naugmentation, which not only benefits our approach but also significantly\nimproves existing VP methods, with performance gains of up to 12 percentage\npoints on certain datasets. This demonstrates that appropriate data\naugmentation is universally beneficial for VP training. Extensive experiments\nacross twelve diverse image classification datasets with two different model\narchitectures demonstrate that ACAVP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among\nVP methods, surpasses linear probing in average accuracy, and exhibits superior\nrobustness to distribution shifts, all while maintaining minimal computational\noverhead during inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "ACAVP enhances visual prompting with affine and color transformations to address limited expressivity and overfitting, achieving SOTA accuracy among VP methods while maintaining computational efficiency.", "motivation": "Conventional visual prompting methods suffer from restricted expressivity of simple additive transformations and overfitting when increasing parameters, leading to lower accuracy compared to other adaptation approaches.", "method": "Proposes ACAVP with three complementary transformations: affine transformation for task-specific prompt regions, color transformation for emphasizing relevant features, and additive transformation.

This paper introduces AlignGS, a novel\nframework that actualizes this vision by pioneering a synergistic, end-to-end\noptimization of geometry and semantics. Our method distills rich priors from 2D\nfoundation models and uses them to directly regularize the 3D representation\nthrough a set of novel semantic-to-geometry guidance mechanisms, including\ndepth consistency and multi-faceted normal regularization. Extensive\nevaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and produces reconstructions\nwith superior geometric accuracy. The results validate that leveraging semantic\npriors as a geometric regularizer leads to more coherent and complete 3D models\nfrom limited input views.

Our project\npage is at https://haofeixu.github.io/resplat/.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReSplat is a recurrent Gaussian splatting model that iteratively refines 3D Gaussians using rendering error as feedback, achieving state-of-the-art performance with fewer Gaussians and faster rendering.", "motivation": "Feed-forward Gaussian splatting models are limited by single-pass inference. The authors aim to overcome this limitation by introducing iterative refinement without explicit gradient computation.", "method": "Uses recurrent network with rendering error as feedback signal to iteratively update Gaussians. Initializes with compact reconstruction model in 16\u00d7 subsampled space, producing 16\u00d7 fewer Gaussians than per-pixel models.", "result": "Achieves state-of-the-art performance across varying input views (2, 8, 16), resolutions (256\u00d7256 to 540\u00d7960), and datasets (DL3DV and RealEstate10K). Significantly reduces number of Gaussians and improves rendering speed.", "conclusion": "ReSplat demonstrates that rendering error serves as effective feedback for iterative Gaussian refinement, enabling robust generalization to unseen data with improved computational efficiency."}}
