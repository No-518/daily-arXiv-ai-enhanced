### [1] [Leveraging NTPs for Efficient Hallucination Detection in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20379)
*Ofir Azachi,Kfir Eliyahu,Eyal El Ani,Rom Himelstein,Roi Reichart,Yuval Pinter,Nitay Calderon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes using next-token probabilities (NTPs) from vision-language models as lightweight features for detecting hallucinations, achieving comparable performance to VLMs with traditional ML models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hallucination detection methods using VLMs are computationally intensive and increase latency. The authors aim to develop an efficient on-the-fly detection method using lightweight traditional ML models.

Method: Train traditional ML models using NTP-based features from VLMs as predictors of hallucinations. Augment with linguistic NTPs and integrate VLM hallucination prediction scores.

Result: NTP-based features are valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling simple ML models to achieve performance comparable to VLMs. Combining NTPs with linguistic NTPs and VLM scores further enhances detection performance.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that lightweight NTP-based methods can effectively detect hallucinations, paving the way for simple solutions to enhance VLM reliability without heavy computational costs.

Abstract: Hallucinations of vision-language models (VLMs), which are misalignments
between visual content and generated text, undermine the reliability of VLMs.
One common approach for detecting them employs the same VLM, or a different
one, to assess generated outputs. This process is computationally intensive and
increases model latency. In this paper, we explore an efficient on-the-fly
method for hallucination detection by training traditional ML models over
signals based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs). NTPs provide a
direct quantification of model uncertainty. We hypothesize that high
uncertainty (i.e., a low NTP value) is strongly associated with hallucinations.
To test this, we introduce a dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements
derived from VLM-generated content, each labeled as hallucinated or not, and
use it to test our NTP-based lightweight method. Our results demonstrate that
NTP-based features are valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling fast and
simple ML models to achieve performance comparable to that of strong VLMs.
Furthermore, augmenting these NTPs with linguistic NTPs, computed by feeding
only the generated text back into the VLM, enhances hallucination detection
performance. Finally, integrating hallucination prediction scores from VLMs
into the NTP-based models led to better performance than using either VLMs or
NTPs alone. We hope this study paves the way for simple, lightweight solutions
that enhance the reliability of VLMs.

### [2] [Quasi-Synthetic Riemannian Data Generation for Writer-Independent Offline Signature Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20420)
*Elias N. Zois,Moises Diaz,Salem Said,Miguel A. Ferrer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A quasi-synthetic data generation framework using Riemannian geometry of SPD matrices for writer-independent signature verification, achieving low error rates without real-world training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline handwritten signature verification is challenging in writer-independent settings, and existing methods rely on real-world datasets for training. The paper aims to overcome this limitation by generating synthetic data in Riemannian spaces.

Method: Uses Riemannian Gaussian Mixture on SPD matrices to generate synthetic writers and their properties. Riemannian Gaussian sampling creates positive/negative synthetic SPD populations. A metric learning framework trains on similar/dissimilar SPD pairs.

Result: Experiments on Western and Asian signature datasets show low error rates under intra- and cross-dataset evaluation protocols, demonstrating the approach's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The quasi-synthetic approach highlights the potential of generating synthetic data in Riemannian spaces for writer-independent signature verification systems.

Abstract: Offline handwritten signature verification remains a challenging task,
particularly in writer-independent settings where models must generalize across
unseen individuals. Recent developments have highlighted the advantage of
geometrically inspired representations, such as covariance descriptors on
Riemannian manifolds. However, past or present, handcrafted or data-driven
methods usually depend on real-world signature datasets for classifier
training. We introduce a quasi-synthetic data generation framework leveraging
the Riemannian geometry of Symmetric Positive Definite matrices (SPD). A small
set of genuine samples in the SPD space is the seed to a Riemannian Gaussian
Mixture which identifies Riemannian centers as synthetic writers and variances
as their properties. Riemannian Gaussian sampling on each center generates
positive as well as negative synthetic SPD populations. A metric learning
framework utilizes pairs of similar and dissimilar SPD points, subsequently
testing it over on real-world datasets. Experiments conducted on two popular
signature datasets, encompassing Western and Asian writing styles, demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed approach under both intra- and cross- dataset
evaluation protocols. The results indicate that our quasi-synthetic approach
achieves low error rates, highlighting the potential of generating synthetic
data in Riemannian spaces for writer-independent signature verification
systems.

TL;DR: Seedream 4.0 is an efficient multimodal image generation system that unifies text-to-image synthesis, image editing, and multi-image composition in a single framework using a diffusion transformer with optimized VAE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified system that extends traditional text-to-image systems into more interactive and multidimensional creative tools for both creativity and professional applications.

Method: Developed a highly efficient diffusion transformer with powerful VAE to reduce image tokens, enabling efficient training and fast generation of high-resolution images. Used comprehensive data collection across vertical scenarios, multi-modal post-training with fine-tuned VLM, and inference acceleration techniques including adversarial distillation, distribution matching, quantization, and speculative decoding.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image editing, with inference time of up to 1.8 seconds for 2K images. Demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in complex tasks including precise image editing, in-context reasoning, multi-image reference, and multiple output image generation.

Conclusion: Seedream 4.0 pushes the boundary of generative AI by creating an interactive and multidimensional creative tool that outperforms traditional T2I systems, making it accessible for both creative and professional applications.

Abstract: We introduce Seedream 4.0, an efficient and high-performance multimodal image
generation system that unifies text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, image editing,
and multi-image composition within a single framework. We develop a highly
efficient diffusion transformer with a powerful VAE which also can reduce the
number of image tokens considerably. This allows for efficient training of our
model, and enables it to fast generate native high-resolution images (e.g.,
1K-4K). Seedream 4.0 is pretrained on billions of text-image pairs spanning
diverse taxonomies and knowledge-centric concepts. Comprehensive data
collection across hundreds of vertical scenarios, coupled with optimized
strategies, ensures stable and large-scale training, with strong
generalization. By incorporating a carefully fine-tuned VLM model, we perform
multi-modal post-training for training both T2I and image editing tasks
jointly. For inference acceleration, we integrate adversarial distillation,
distribution matching, and quantization, as well as speculative decoding. It
achieves an inference time of up to 1.8 seconds for generating a 2K image
(without a LLM/VLM as PE model). Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Seedream
4.0 can achieve state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image
editing. In particular, it demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in
complex tasks, including precise image editing and in-context reasoning, and
also allows for multi-image reference, and can generate multiple output images.
This extends traditional T2I systems into an more interactive and
multidimensional creative tool, pushing the boundary of generative AI for both
creativity and professional applications. Seedream 4.0 is now accessible on

### [4] [A Contrastive Learning Framework for Breast Cancer Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20474)
*Samia Saeed,Khuram Naveed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Contrastive Learning framework using Resnet-50 for breast cancer detection that achieves 96.7% accuracy on benchmark datasets, addressing the challenge of limited labeled data through semi-supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast cancer is a major global health concern where early detection is crucial. Deep learning methods show promise but struggle with accuracy due to limited labeled datasets for training. The paper aims to overcome this limitation by leveraging contrastive learning that works effectively with smaller labeled datasets.

Method: The study uses a semi-supervised Contrastive Learning approach with Resnet-50 architecture. It trains on large amounts of unlabeled mammogram data using similarity index and various augmentation/transformations, then fine-tunes on a small labeled dataset.

Result: The proposed method achieves 96.7% accuracy in detecting breast cancer on benchmark datasets INbreast and MIAS, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The contrastive learning framework successfully addresses the challenge of limited labeled data in medical imaging, demonstrating superior performance for breast cancer detection and showing potential for applications where large labeled datasets are scarce.

Abstract: Breast cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally,
accounts for a quarter of all cancer cases [1]. To lower this death rate, it is
crucial to detect tumors early, as early-stage detection significantly improves
treatment outcomes. Advances in non-invasive imaging techniques have made early
detection possible through computer-aided detection (CAD) systems which rely on
traditional image analysis to identify malignancies. However, there is a
growing shift towards deep learning methods due to their superior
effectiveness. Despite their potential, deep learning methods often struggle
with accuracy due to the limited availability of large-labeled datasets for
training. To address this issue, our study introduces a Contrastive Learning
(CL) framework, which excels with smaller labeled datasets. In this regard, we
train Resnet-50 in semi supervised CL approach using similarity index on a
large amount of unlabeled mammogram data. In this regard, we use various
augmentation and transformations which help improve the performance of our
approach. Finally, we tune our model on a small set of labelled data that
outperforms the existing state of the art. Specifically, we observed a 96.7%
accuracy in detecting breast cancer on benchmark datasets INbreast and MIAS.

### [5] [Are Foundation Models Ready for Industrial Defect Recognition? A Reality Check on Real-World Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20479)
*Simon Baeuerle,Pratik Khanna,Nils Friederich,Angelo Jovin Yamachui Sitcheu,Damir Shakirov,Andreas Steimer,Ralf Mikut*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foundation Models (FMs) show promise for automated quality inspection in manufacturing but fail on real-world industrial data despite good performance on public benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage FMs' zero-shot generalization capabilities for automated quality inspection in series manufacturing, replacing tedious labeling tasks with simple text prompts and using the same models across multiple products.

Method: Tested multiple recent Foundation Models on both custom real-world industrial image data and public image datasets to evaluate their performance in zero-shot settings.

Result: All tested Foundation Models failed on real-world industrial image data, while performing well on public benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Current Foundation Models are not yet suitable for real-world industrial quality inspection applications despite their promising zero-shot capabilities on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) have shown impressive performance on various text and
image processing tasks. They can generalize across domains and datasets in a
zero-shot setting. This could make them suitable for automated quality
inspection during series manufacturing, where various types of images are being
evaluated for many different products. Replacing tedious labeling tasks with a
simple text prompt to describe anomalies and utilizing the same models across
many products would save significant efforts during model setup and
implementation. This is a strong advantage over supervised Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models, which are trained for individual applications and
require labeled training data. We test multiple recent FMs on both custom
real-world industrial image data and public image data. We show that all of
those models fail on our real-world data, while the very same models perform
well on public benchmark datasets.

### [6] [Shared Neural Space: Unified Precomputed Feature Encoding for Multi-Task and Cross Domain Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20481)
*Jing Li,Oskar Bartosz,Chengyu Wang,Michal Wnuczynski,Dilshan Godaliyadda,Michael Polley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a universal Neural Space (NS) using an encoder-decoder framework to create shared feature representations across multiple vision and imaging tasks, reducing redundancy and improving generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models are inefficient for applications requiring multiple modular tasks, as each task requires mapping to different latent domains, leading to redundancy and poor generalization across domain shifts.

Method: A lightweight CNN-based encoder-decoder framework that pre-computes transformation-aware, generalizable representations, enabling multiple downstream AI modules to share the same feature space.

Result: The proposed Neural Space architecture efficiently performs various imaging and vision tasks including demosaicing, denoising, depth estimation, and semantic segmentation while being lightweight and hardware-friendly.

Conclusion: The universal Neural Space establishes an efficient foundation for multi-task vision pipelines, reducing redundancy and improving generalization compared to task-specific models or larger transformer backbones.

Abstract: The majority of AI models in imaging and vision are customized to perform on
specific high-precision task. However, this strategy is inefficient for
applications with a series of modular tasks, since each requires a mapping into
a disparate latent domain. To address this inefficiency, we proposed a
universal Neural Space (NS), where an encoder-decoder framework pre-computes
features across vision and imaging tasks. Our encoder learns transformation
aware, generalizable representations, which enable multiple downstream AI
modules to share the same feature space. This architecture reduces redundancy,
improves generalization across domain shift, and establishes a foundation for
effecient multi-task vision pipelines. Furthermore, as opposed to larger
transformer backbones, our backbone is lightweight and CNN-based, allowing for
wider across hardware. We furthur demonstrate that imaging and vision modules,
such as demosaicing, denoising, depth estimation and semantic segmentation can
be performed efficiently in the NS.

### [7] [Data-Efficient Stream-Based Active Distillation for Scalable Edge Model Deployment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20484)
*Dani Manjah,Tim Bary,Benoît Gérin,Benoît Macq,Christophe de Vleeschouwer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a strategy for selecting the most useful images to train edge device models efficiently, combining high-confidence stream-based selection with diversity-based approaches to maximize model quality while minimizing transmission costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge camera systems need regular model updates but face computational constraints. Current practice uses central server teacher models to annotate data for training smaller edge models, but this approach needs optimization for transmission efficiency.

Method: The authors use a high-confidence stream-based strategy combined with a diversity-based approach to select the most valuable training images, focusing on minimizing dataset queries while maintaining training iterations.

Result: The proposed approach produces high-quality models with minimal dataset queries compared to standard training methods, achieving similar training loads with better efficiency.

Conclusion: Combining confidence-based streaming with diversity selection is an effective strategy for training edge device models efficiently, balancing model quality with transmission cost constraints.

Abstract: Edge camera-based systems are continuously expanding, facing ever-evolving
environments that require regular model updates. In practice, complex teacher
models are run on a central server to annotate data, which is then used to
train smaller models tailored to the edge devices with limited computational
power. This work explores how to select the most useful images for training to
maximize model quality while keeping transmission costs low. Our work shows
that, for a similar training load (i.e., iterations), a high-confidence
stream-based strategy coupled with a diversity-based approach produces a
high-quality model with minimal dataset queries.

### [8] [InstructVTON: Optimal Auto-Masking and Natural-Language-Guided Interactive Style Control for Inpainting-Based Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20524)
*Julien Han,Shuwen Qiu,Qi Li,Xingzi Xu,Mehmet Saygin Seyfioglu,Kavosh Asadi,Karim Bouyarmane*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstructVTON is an instruction-following virtual try-on system that uses natural language instructions instead of manual masking for complex garment styling control, achieving state-of-the-art results through Vision Language Models and automated segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional virtual try-on models rely on binary masks that are difficult to create, require background knowledge, and cannot handle complex styling scenarios like changing sleeve positions. The masking-based approach limits user experience and cannot achieve certain styling modifications.

Method: Leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation models to automatically generate binary masks based on user-provided images and free-text style instructions, eliminating the need for manual mask creation and enabling complex styling control.

Result: InstructVTON achieves state-of-the-art results with styling control, is interoperable with existing virtual try-on models, and can handle scenarios impossible with traditional masking-based approaches (e.g., changing sleeve positions).

Conclusion: The system simplifies the end-user experience by automating mask generation and enabling complex styling instructions through natural language, making virtual try-on more accessible and capable of handling sophisticated fashion modifications.

Abstract: We present InstructVTON, an instruction-following interactive virtual try-on
system that allows fine-grained and complex styling control of the resulting
generation, guided by natural language, on single or multiple garments. A
computationally efficient and scalable formulation of virtual try-on formulates
the problem as an image-guided or image-conditioned inpainting task. These
inpainting-based virtual try-on models commonly use a binary mask to control
the generation layout. Producing a mask that yields desirable result is
difficult, requires background knowledge, might be model dependent, and in some
cases impossible with the masking-based approach (e.g. trying on a long-sleeve
shirt with "sleeves rolled up" styling on a person wearing long-sleeve shirt
with sleeves down, where the mask will necessarily cover the entire sleeve).
InstructVTON leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation
models for automated binary mask generation. These masks are generated based on
user-provided images and free-text style instructions. InstructVTON simplifies
the end-user experience by removing the necessity of a precisely drawn mask,
and by automating execution of multiple rounds of image generation for try-on
scenarios that cannot be achieved with masking-based virtual try-on models
alone. We show that InstructVTON is interoperable with existing virtual try-on
models to achieve state-of-the-art results with styling control.

*Dana A Abdullah,Dana Rasul Hamad,Bishar Rasheed Ibrahim,Sirwan Abdulwahid Aula,Aso Khaleel Ameen,Sabat Salih Hamadamin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepAFRNet is a deep learning model for recognizing altered fingerprints using VGG16 backbone and cosine similarity, achieving high accuracy (96.7-99.54%) on real altered fingerprint datasets with strict thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Altered fingerprint recognition is challenging but essential for biometric verification in border control, forensics, and fiscal admission, as adversaries can deliberately modify ridge patterns to evade detection.

Method: Uses VGG16 backbone to extract high-dimensional features and cosine similarity to compare embeddings, evaluated on SOCOFing Real-Altered subset with three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard).

Result: With strict thresholds (0.92), achieves accuracies of 96.7%, 98.76%, and 99.54% for Easy, Medium, and Hard levels respectively. Threshold sensitivity study shows dramatic accuracy degradation (to 7.86-29.51%) when threshold is relaxed to 0.72.

Conclusion: DeepAFRNet addresses limitations of prior work by using real altered samples and reporting per-level metrics, indicating readiness for real-world deployments where both security and recognition resilience are critical.

Abstract: Altered fingerprint recognition (AFR) is challenging for biometric
verification in applications such as border control, forensics, and fiscal
admission. Adversaries can deliberately modify ridge patterns to evade
detection, so robust recognition of altered prints is essential. We present
DeepAFRNet, a deep learning recognition model that matches and recognizes
distorted fingerprint samples. The approach uses a VGG16 backbone to extract
high-dimensional features and cosine similarity to compare embeddings. We
evaluate on the SOCOFing Real-Altered subset with three difficulty levels
(Easy, Medium, Hard). With strict thresholds, DeepAFRNet achieves accuracies of
96.7 percent, 98.76 percent, and 99.54 percent for the three levels. A
threshold-sensitivity study shows that relaxing the threshold from 0.92 to 0.72
sharply degrades accuracy to 7.86 percent, 27.05 percent, and 29.51 percent,
underscoring the importance of threshold selection in biometric systems. By
using real altered samples and reporting per-level metrics, DeepAFRNet
addresses limitations of prior work based on synthetic alterations or limited
verification protocols, and indicates readiness for real-world deployments
where both security and recognition resilience are critical.

Motivation: To enhance bimanual robotic manipulation by incorporating semantic cues from pre-trained vision models into 3D voxel representations for better policy learning.

Method: Extract attention maps from DINOv2 Vision Transformer, interpret them as pixel-level saliency scores, lift them into 3D voxel grid, and incorporate into behavior cloning policy.

Result: Achieved average absolute improvement of 8.2% and relative gain of 21.9% across all tasks in RLBench bimanual benchmark when integrated into state-of-the-art voxel-based policy.

Conclusion: Attention-guided featurization from pre-trained vision models significantly enhances robotic manipulation performance by providing semantic cues to voxel-based policies.

Abstract: We investigate the integration of attention maps from a pre-trained Vision
Transformer into voxel representations to enhance bimanual robotic
manipulation. Specifically, we extract attention maps from DINOv2, a
self-supervised ViT model, and interpret them as pixel-level saliency scores
over RGB images. These maps are lifted into a 3D voxel grid, resulting in
voxel-level semantic cues that are incorporated into a behavior cloning policy.
When integrated into a state-of-the-art voxel-based policy, our
attention-guided featurization yields an average absolute improvement of 8.2%
and a relative gain of 21.9% across all tasks in the RLBench bimanual
benchmark.

*Xinyang Mu,Yuzhen Lu,Boyang Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Comparative benchmark analysis of 36 real-time object detectors (YOLO v8-v12 and RT-DETR v1-v2) for blueberry detection, evaluated on a new dataset of 85,879 labeled instances, with semi-supervised learning enhancement achieving up to 94.8% mAP@50.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blueberry detection in natural environments is challenging due to variable lighting, occlusions, and motion blur. Deep learning detectors need large-scale datasets and optimal accuracy/speed/memory trade-offs for practical deployment.

Method: Evaluated 36 model variants on a curated dataset of 661 canopy images with 85,879 labeled blueberries. Applied Unbiased Mean Teacher-based semi-supervised learning on 1,035 unlabeled images for performance enhancement.

Result: YOLOv12m achieved 93.3% mAP@50, RT-DETRv2-X achieved 93.6% mAP@50. SSL fine-tuning improved accuracy by up to 2.9%, with RT-DETR-v2-X reaching 94.8% mAP@50. Mid-sized models offered best accuracy-speed balance.

Conclusion: Real-time object detectors show strong performance for blueberry detection. Semi-supervised learning provides modest gains, but more research is needed to better leverage cross-domain unlabeled data. Dataset and software are publicly available.

Abstract: Blueberry detection in natural environments remains challenging due to
variable lighting, occlusions, and motion blur due to environmental factors and
imaging devices. Deep learning-based object detectors promise to address these
challenges, but they demand a large-scale, diverse dataset that captures the
real-world complexities. Moreover, deploying these models in practical
scenarios often requires the right accuracy/speed/memory trade-off in model
selection. This study presents a novel comparative benchmark analysis of
advanced real-time object detectors, including YOLO (You Only Look Once)
(v8-v12) and RT-DETR (Real-Time Detection Transformers) (v1-v2) families,
consisting of 36 model variants, evaluated on a newly curated dataset for
blueberry detection. This dataset comprises 661 canopy images collected with
smartphones during the 2022-2023 seasons, consisting of 85,879 labelled
instances (including 36,256 ripe and 49,623 unripe blueberries) across a wide
range of lighting conditions, occlusions, and fruit maturity stages. Among the
YOLO models, YOLOv12m achieved the best accuracy with a mAP@50 of 93.3%, while
RT-DETRv2-X obtained a mAP@50 of 93.6%, the highest among all the RT-DETR
variants. The inference time varied with the model scale and complexity, and
the mid-sized models appeared to offer a good accuracy-speed balance. To
further enhance detection performance, all the models were fine-tuned using
Unbiased Mean Teacher-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) on a separate set of
1,035 unlabeled images acquired by a ground-based machine vision platform in
2024. This resulted in accuracy gains ranging from -1.4% to 2.9%, with
RT-DETR-v2-X achieving the best mAP@50 of 94.8%. More in-depth research into
SSL is needed to better leverage cross-domain unlabeled data. Both the dataset
and software programs of this study are made publicly available to support
further research.

*Farbod Bigdeli,Mohsen Mohammadagha,Ali Bigdeli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a lightweight ROI augmentation strategy for mammography classification that probabilistically replaces full images with random ROI crops during training, showing modest performance gains without additional inference cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast cancer screening with mammography is crucial for early detection, but deep learning approaches are limited by small datasets and low resolution. The authors aim to improve performance through simple data-centric augmentation without requiring additional labels or architectural changes.

Method: A region-of-interest (ROI) augmentation strategy where full mammogram images are probabilistically replaced with random ROI crops from a precomputed bounding-box bank during training, with optional jitter for variability. Evaluated on Mini-DDSM dataset with patient-level cross-validation.

Result: ROI augmentation (best parameters: p_roi = 0.10, alpha = 0.10) yields modest average ROC-AUC gains with varying performance across folds, while PR-AUC remains flat to slightly lower. The method maintains inference-time efficiency since augmentation is training-only.

Conclusion: Simple, data-centric ROI augmentation strategies can enhance mammography classification in constrained settings without requiring additional labels or architectural modifications, demonstrating the value of lightweight augmentation approaches.

Abstract: Breast cancer screening with mammography remains central to early detection
and mortality reduction. Deep learning has shown strong potential for
automating mammogram interpretation, yet limited-resolution datasets and small
sample sizes continue to restrict performance. We revisit the Mini-DDSM dataset
(9,684 images; 2,414 patients) and introduce a lightweight region-of-interest
(ROI) augmentation strategy. During training, full images are probabilistically
replaced with random ROI crops sampled from a precomputed, label-free
bounding-box bank, with optional jitter to increase variability. We evaluate
under strict patient-level cross-validation and report ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and
training-time efficiency metrics (throughput and GPU memory). Because ROI
augmentation is training-only, inference-time cost remains unchanged. On
Mini-DDSM, ROI augmentation (best: p_roi = 0.10, alpha = 0.10) yields modest
average ROC-AUC gains, with performance varying across folds; PR-AUC is flat to
slightly lower. These results demonstrate that simple, data-centric ROI
strategies can enhance mammography classification in constrained settings
without requiring additional labels or architectural modifications.

### [13] [Reflect3r: Single-View 3D Stereo Reconstruction Aided by Mirror Reflections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20607)
*Jing Wu,Zirui Wang,Iro Laina,Victor Adrian Prisacariu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method for 3D reconstruction from single images containing mirror reflections by treating reflections as auxiliary views and constructing physically valid virtual cameras, enabling multi-view stereo from single captures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mirror reflections are common in everyday environments and can provide stereo information within a single capture, as both real and reflected virtual views are visible simultaneously, simplifying the imaging process for 3D reconstruction.

Method: The method treats mirror reflections as auxiliary views, designs a transformation to construct physically valid virtual cameras for direct pixel-domain virtual view generation, uses symmetric-aware loss for pose refinement, and extends to dynamic scenes with per-frame geometry recovery.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic data demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, with a fully customizable synthetic dataset of 16 Blender scenes provided for quantitative evaluation.

Conclusion: The framework enables robust 3D reconstruction from single images with mirror reflections, making it compatible with feed-forward reconstruction models and applicable to both static and dynamic scenes.

Abstract: Mirror reflections are common in everyday environments and can provide stereo
information within a single capture, as the real and reflected virtual views
are visible simultaneously. We exploit this property by treating the reflection
as an auxiliary view and designing a transformation that constructs a
physically valid virtual camera, allowing direct pixel-domain generation of the
virtual view while adhering to the real-world imaging process. This enables a
multi-view stereo setup from a single image, simplifying the imaging process,
making it compatible with powerful feed-forward reconstruction models for
generalizable and robust 3D reconstruction. To further exploit the geometric
symmetry introduced by mirrors, we propose a symmetric-aware loss to refine
pose estimation. Our framework also naturally extends to dynamic scenes, where
each frame contains a mirror reflection, enabling efficient per-frame geometry
recovery. For quantitative evaluation, we provide a fully customizable
synthetic dataset of 16 Blender scenes, each with ground-truth point clouds and
camera poses. Extensive experiments on real-world data and synthetic data are
conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FacadeTrack is a street-level framework that uses language-guided panoramic video analysis to assess building occupancy after disasters, achieving high precision and recall through two decision strategies with interpretable intermediate attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for assessing building occupancy after disasters have limitations - overhead imagery misses facade details while street-view imagery is sparse and hard to align with parcels. There's a need for scalable, auditable occupancy assessments that capture critical habitability cues.

Method: FacadeTrack links panoramic video to parcels, rectifies views to facades, and extracts interpretable attributes (entry blockage, temporary coverings, debris) using two decision strategies: a transparent one-stage rule and a two-stage design that separates perception from conservative reasoning.

Result: Evaluated on post-Hurricane Helene surveys, the two-stage approach achieved precision of 0.927, recall of 0.781, and F-1 score of 0.848, outperforming the one-stage baseline (precision 0.943, recall 0.728, F-1 0.822). Intermediate attributes enable targeted quality control.

Conclusion: FacadeTrack provides auditable, scalable occupancy assessments suitable for integration into geospatial and emergency-management workflows, with interpretable attributes that reveal where and why errors occur for improved quality control.

Abstract: Building-level occupancy after disasters is vital for triage, inspections,
utility re-energization, and equitable resource allocation. Overhead imagery
provides rapid coverage but often misses facade and access cues that determine
habitability, while street-view imagery captures those details but is sparse
and difficult to align with parcels. We present FacadeTrack, a street-level,
language-guided framework that links panoramic video to parcels, rectifies
views to facades, and elicits interpretable attributes (for example, entry
blockage, temporary coverings, localized debris) that drive two decision
strategies: a transparent one-stage rule and a two-stage design that separates
perception from conservative reasoning. Evaluated across two post-Hurricane
Helene surveys, the two-stage approach achieves a precision of 0.927, a recall
of 0.781, and an F-1 score of 0.848, compared with the one-stage baseline at a
precision of 0.943, a recall of 0.728, and an F-1 score of 0.822. Beyond
accuracy, intermediate attributes and spatial diagnostics reveal where and why
residual errors occur, enabling targeted quality control. The pipeline provides
auditable, scalable occupancy assessments suitable for integration into
geospatial and emergency-management workflows.

### [15] [Human Semantic Representations of Social Interactions from Moving Shapes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20673)
*Yiling Yun,Hongjing Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Humans use semantic representations alongside visual features to recognize social interactions in moving shapes. Semantic models, especially verb-based embeddings from descriptions, complement visual features in explaining human similarity judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what semantic representations humans employ to complement visual features when recognizing social interactions from simple moving shapes, bridging visual and abstract representations.

Method: Conducted two studies: Study 1 had participants label animations of moving shapes; Study 2 measured representational geometry of 27 social interactions through human similarity judgments and compared with model predictions based on visual features, labels, and semantic embeddings from descriptions.

Result: Human responses were distributed in labeling animations. Semantic models provided complementary information to visual features, with verb-based embeddings from descriptions accounting for human similarity judgments the best.

Conclusion: Social perception in simple displays reflects the semantic structure of social interactions, suggesting that humans bridge visual and abstract representations when recognizing social interactions.

Abstract: Humans are social creatures who readily recognize various social interactions
from simple display of moving shapes. While previous research has often focused
on visual features, we examine what semantic representations that humans employ
to complement visual features. In Study 1, we directly asked human participants
to label the animations based on their impression of moving shapes. We found
that human responses were distributed. In Study 2, we measured the
representational geometry of 27 social interactions through human similarity
judgments and compared it with model predictions based on visual features,
labels, and semantic embeddings from animation descriptions. We found that
semantic models provided complementary information to visual features in
explaining human judgments. Among the semantic models, verb-based embeddings
extracted from descriptions account for human similarity judgments the best.
These results suggest that social perception in simple displays reflects the
semantic structure of social interactions, bridging visual and abstract
representations.

### [16] [Enhancing Cross-View Geo-Localization Generalization via Global-Local Consistency and Geometric Equivariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20684)
*Xiaowei Wang,Di Wang,Ke Li,Yifeng Wang,Chengjian Wang,Libin Sun,Zhihong Wu,Yiming Zhang,Quan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EGS is a novel cross-view geo-localization framework that enhances cross-domain generalization using E(2)-Steerable CNN encoder and graph-based global-local consistency mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CVGL methods struggle with severe appearance variations from diverse UAV orientations/fields of view (hindering cross-domain generalization) and establishing reliable correspondences that capture both global semantics and local details.

Method: Proposes EGS framework with E(2)-Steerable CNN encoder for rotation/viewpoint-invariant features, and constructs a graph with virtual super-node that connects to all local nodes to aggregate global semantics and redistribute to local regions for global-local consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments on University-1652 and SUES-200 benchmarks show EGS achieves substantial performance gains and establishes new state-of-the-art in cross-domain CVGL.

Conclusion: EGS framework effectively addresses cross-domain generalization challenges in cross-view geo-localization through rotation-invariant feature extraction and global-local consistency mechanisms.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) aims to match images of the same location
captured from drastically different viewpoints. Despite recent progress,
existing methods still face two key challenges: (1) achieving robustness under
severe appearance variations induced by diverse UAV orientations and fields of
view, which hinders cross-domain generalization, and (2) establishing reliable
correspondences that capture both global scene-level semantics and fine-grained
local details. In this paper, we propose EGS, a novel CVGL framework designed
to enhance cross-domain generalization. Specifically, we introduce an
E(2)-Steerable CNN encoder to extract stable and reliable features under
rotation and viewpoint shifts. Furthermore, we construct a graph with a virtual
super-node that connects to all local nodes, enabling global semantics to be
aggregated and redistributed to local regions, thereby enforcing global-local
consistency. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200
benchmarks demonstrate that EGS consistently achieves substantial performance
gains and establishes a new state of the art in cross-domain CVGL.

### [17] [DENet: Dual-Path Edge Network with Global-Local Attention for Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20701)
*Jiayi Zuo,Songwei Pei,Qian Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Dual-Path Edge Network for infrared small target detection that decouples edge enhancement and semantic modeling to address the conflict between capturing spatial details and semantic context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared small targets lack distinctive features and blend into noisy backgrounds, creating a fundamental challenge between capturing high-resolution spatial details for minute targets and extracting robust semantic context for larger targets, which existing methods fail to address adequately.

Method: Proposes a Dual-Path Edge Network with two complementary paths: 1) Bidirectional Interaction Module using Local and Global Self-Attention for multi-scale feature dependencies and semantic modeling, and 2) Multi-Edge Refiner using cascaded Taylor finite difference operators with attention-driven gating for precise edge localization and noise suppression.

Result: The method provides precise infrared small target detection and localization by effectively combining structural semantics and edge refinement in a unified framework.

Conclusion: The proposed approach offers a promising solution for infrared small target detection by explicitly addressing the feature misalignment problem through complementary edge enhancement and semantic modeling paths.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection is crucial for remote sensing applications
like disaster warning and maritime surveillance. However, due to the lack of
distinctive texture and morphological features, infrared small targets are
highly susceptible to blending into cluttered and noisy backgrounds. A
fundamental challenge in designing deep models for this task lies in the
inherent conflict between capturing high-resolution spatial details for minute
targets and extracting robust semantic context for larger targets, often
leading to feature misalignment and suboptimal performance. Existing methods
often rely on fixed gradient operators or simplistic attention mechanisms,
which are inadequate for accurately extracting target edges under low contrast
and high noise. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Path Edge Network that
explicitly addresses this challenge by decoupling edge enhancement and semantic
modeling into two complementary processing paths. The first path employs a
Bidirectional Interaction Module, which uses both Local Self-Attention and
Global Self-Attention to capture multi-scale local and global feature
dependencies. The global attention mechanism, based on a Transformer
architecture, integrates long-range semantic relationships and contextual
information, ensuring robust scene understanding. The second path introduces
the Multi-Edge Refiner, which enhances fine-grained edge details using cascaded
Taylor finite difference operators at multiple scales. This mathematical
approach, along with an attention-driven gating mechanism, enables precise edge
localization and feature enhancement for targets of varying sizes, while
effectively suppressing noise. Our method provides a promising solution for
precise infrared small target detection and localization, combining structural
semantics and edge refinement in a unified framework.

### [18] [Beyond the Individual: Introducing Group Intention Forecasting with SHOT Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20715)
*Ruixu Zhang,Yuran Wang,Xinyi Hu,Chaoyu Mai,Wenxuan Liu,Danni Xu,Xian Zhong,Zheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces group intention forecasting (GIF) as a novel task to predict when collective intentions will emerge from individual actions, presents the SHOT dataset for basketball scenarios, and proposes the GIFT framework for forecasting group intention emergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional intention recognition focuses only on individual intentions, overlooking the complexities of collective intentions that emerge through group interactions and shared goals in multi-agent settings.

Method: The authors propose GIFT (Group Intention ForecasTer), a framework that extracts fine-grained individual features and models evolving group dynamics to forecast when group intentions will occur. They also introduce SHOT, the first large-scale dataset for GIF with 1,979 basketball video clips from 5 camera views annotated with individual attributes.

Result: Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of both the SHOT dataset and the GIFT framework, establishing a strong foundation for group intention forecasting research.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the limitation of traditional individual intention recognition by introducing group intention forecasting, providing both a novel dataset and framework that enable future research in understanding collective intention emergence.

Abstract: Intention recognition has traditionally focused on individual intentions,
overlooking the complexities of collective intentions in group settings. To
address this limitation, we introduce the concept of group intention, which
represents shared goals emerging through the actions of multiple individuals,
and Group Intention Forecasting (GIF), a novel task that forecasts when group
intentions will occur by analyzing individual actions and interactions before
the collective goal becomes apparent. To investigate GIF in a specific
scenario, we propose SHOT, the first large-scale dataset for GIF, consisting of
1,979 basketball video clips captured from 5 camera views and annotated with 6
types of individual attributes. SHOT is designed with 3 key characteristics:
multi-individual information, multi-view adaptability, and multi-level
intention, making it well-suited for studying emerging group intentions.
Furthermore, we introduce GIFT (Group Intention ForecasTer), a framework that
extracts fine-grained individual features and models evolving group dynamics to
forecast intention emergence. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of
SHOT and GIFT, establishing a strong foundation for future research in group
intention forecasting. The dataset is available at

*Yu Guo,Shengfeng He,Yuxu Lu,Haonan An,Yihang Tao,Huilin Zhu,Jingxian Liu,Yuguang Fang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Neptune-X is a data-centric generative-selection framework that addresses maritime object detection challenges by generating diverse synthetic maritime data with a multi-modality-conditioned generative model and dynamically selecting task-relevant samples to improve detection accuracy, especially in underrepresented scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maritime object detection faces two key challenges: scarcity of annotated maritime data and poor generalization across various maritime attributes (object category, viewpoint, location, imaging environment), particularly in underrepresented scenarios like open-sea environments.

Method: Proposes Neptune-X framework with two components: 1) X-to-Maritime generative model with Bidirectional Object-Water Attention module for realistic maritime scene synthesis, and 2) Attribute-correlated Active Sampling for dynamic selection of task-relevant synthetic samples. Also constructs Maritime Generation Dataset for benchmarking.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the approach sets new benchmarks in maritime scene synthesis and significantly improves detection accuracy, particularly in challenging and previously underrepresented settings.

Conclusion: Neptune-X effectively addresses maritime object detection limitations through synthetic data generation and intelligent sample selection, enhancing performance in diverse maritime scenarios where traditional datasets are insufficient.

Abstract: Maritime object detection is essential for navigation safety, surveillance,
and autonomous operations, yet constrained by two key challenges: the scarcity
of annotated maritime data and poor generalization across various maritime
attributes (e.g., object category, viewpoint, location, and imaging
environment). % In particular, models trained on existing datasets often
underperform in underrepresented scenarios such as open-sea environments. To
address these challenges, we propose Neptune-X, a data-centric
generative-selection framework that enhances training effectiveness by
leveraging synthetic data generation with task-aware sample selection. From the
generation perspective, we develop X-to-Maritime, a multi-modality-conditioned
generative model that synthesizes diverse and realistic maritime scenes. A key
component is the Bidirectional Object-Water Attention module, which captures
boundary interactions between objects and their aquatic surroundings to improve
visual fidelity. To further improve downstream tasking performance, we propose
Attribute-correlated Active Sampling, which dynamically selects synthetic
samples based on their task relevance. To support robust benchmarking, we
construct the Maritime Generation Dataset, the first dataset tailored for
generative maritime learning, encompassing a wide range of semantic conditions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark in
maritime scene synthesis, significantly improving detection accuracy,
particularly in challenging and previously underrepresented settings.The code

*Sofia McLeod,Chee-Kheng Chng,Matthew Rodda,Tat-Jun Chin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STELLA is the first end-to-end Crater-Based Navigation pipeline for long-duration lunar mapping missions, achieving metre-level position and sub-degree attitude accuracy across varied conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Crater-Based Navigation (CBN) methods are designed for short-duration landing missions with nadir viewpoints and good lighting, but lunar mapping missions involve sparse, oblique imagery under varying illumination over year-long campaigns, requiring more robust pose estimation.

Method: STELLA combines Mask R-CNN-based crater detection, descriptor-less crater identification, robust perspective-n-crater pose solver, and batch orbit determination back-end. Tested on CRESENT-365 dataset with 15,283 images simulating year-long lunar mapping.

Result: STELLA maintains metre-level position accuracy and sub-degree attitude accuracy on average across wide ranges of viewing angles, illumination conditions, and lunar latitudes.

Conclusion: This work provides the first comprehensive assessment of CBN in true lunar mapping settings and identifies operational conditions for future missions.

Abstract: Crater-Based Navigation (CBN) uses the ubiquitous impact craters of the Moon
observed on images as natural landmarks to determine the six degrees of freedom
pose of a spacecraft. To date, CBN has primarily been studied in the context of
powered descent and landing. These missions are typically short in duration,
with high-frequency imagery captured from a nadir viewpoint over well-lit
terrain. In contrast, lunar mapping missions involve sparse, oblique imagery
acquired under varying illumination conditions over potentially year-long
campaigns, posing significantly greater challenges for pose estimation. We
bridge this gap with STELLA - the first end-to-end CBN pipeline for
long-duration lunar mapping. STELLA combines a Mask R-CNN-based crater
detector, a descriptor-less crater identification module, a robust
perspective-n-crater pose solver, and a batch orbit determination back-end. To
rigorously test STELLA, we introduce CRESENT-365 - the first public dataset
that emulates a year-long lunar mapping mission. Each of its 15,283 images is
rendered from high-resolution digital elevation models with SPICE-derived Sun
angles and Moon motion, delivering realistic global coverage, illumination
cycles, and viewing geometries. Experiments on CRESENT+ and CRESENT-365 show
that STELLA maintains metre-level position accuracy and sub-degree attitude
accuracy on average across wide ranges of viewing angles, illumination
conditions, and lunar latitudes. These results constitute the first
comprehensive assessment of CBN in a true lunar mapping setting and inform
operational conditions that should be considered for future missions.

### [21] [Seeing Through Words, Speaking Through Pixels: Deep Representational Alignment Between Vision and Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20751)
*Zoe Wanying He,Sean Trott,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep vision-only and language-only models trained on disjoint modalities project inputs into a partially aligned representational space, with alignment peaking in mid-to-late layers and capturing human semantic preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand where alignment emerges in unimodal networks, what cues support it, whether it captures human preferences in many-to-many scenarios, and how exemplar aggregation affects alignment.

Method: Systematic investigation of representational alignment across layers, robustness tests to semantic changes, forced-choice "Pick-a-Pic" task for human preference comparison, and analysis of embedding averaging effects.

Result: Alignment peaks in mid-to-late layers, is robust to appearance changes but collapses with semantic alterations, mirrors human preferences bidirectionally, and is amplified by exemplar averaging.

Conclusion: Unimodal networks converge on a shared semantic code that aligns with human judgments and strengthens with exemplar aggregation.

Abstract: Recent studies show that deep vision-only and language-only models--trained
on disjoint modalities--nonetheless project their inputs into a partially
aligned representational space. Yet we still lack a clear picture of where in
each network this convergence emerges, what visual or linguistic cues support
it, whether it captures human preferences in many-to-many image-text scenarios,
and how aggregating exemplars of the same concept affects alignment. Here, we
systematically investigate these questions. We find that alignment peaks in
mid-to-late layers of both model types, reflecting a shift from
modality-specific to conceptually shared representations. This alignment is
robust to appearance-only changes but collapses when semantics are altered
(e.g., object removal or word-order scrambling), highlighting that the shared
code is truly semantic. Moving beyond the one-to-one image-caption paradigm, a
forced-choice "Pick-a-Pic" task shows that human preferences for image-caption
matches are mirrored in the embedding spaces across all vision-language model
pairs. This pattern holds bidirectionally when multiple captions correspond to
a single image, demonstrating that models capture fine-grained semantic
distinctions akin to human judgments. Surprisingly, averaging embeddings across
exemplars amplifies alignment rather than blurring detail. Together, our
results demonstrate that unimodal networks converge on a shared semantic code
that aligns with human judgments and strengthens with exemplar aggregation.

*Yuhong Zhang,Han Wang,Yiwen Wang,Rong Xie,Li Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeInsert is a training-free framework that enables geometrically controlled and style-consistent object insertion into images using 3D geometric information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image editing methods lack geometric control over inserted objects (limited to 2D space), struggle with style consistency between objects and background, and require extensive training for object insertion tasks.

Method: Convert 2D objects into 3D using existing 3D generation models, perform interactive editing at 3D level, then re-render to 2D from specified views. Combine geometric control with style and content control through diffusion adapters.

Result: The framework produces geometrically controlled and style-consistent edited images without requiring training.

Conclusion: FreeInsert successfully addresses the limitations of current image editing methods by leveraging 3D geometric information for precise control and style consistency in object insertion tasks.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have made significant progress in image
generation, allowing for effortless customized generation. However, existing
image editing methods still face certain limitations when dealing with
personalized image composition tasks. First, there is the issue of lack of
geometric control over the inserted objects. Current methods are confined to 2D
space and typically rely on textual instructions, making it challenging to
maintain precise geometric control over the objects. Second, there is the
challenge of style consistency. Existing methods often overlook the style
consistency between the inserted object and the background, resulting in a lack
of realism. In addition, the challenge of inserting objects into images without
extensive training remains significant. To address these issues, we propose
\textit{FreeInsert}, a novel training-free framework that customizes object
insertion into arbitrary scenes by leveraging 3D geometric information.
Benefiting from the advances in existing 3D generation models, we first convert
the 2D object into 3D, perform interactive editing at the 3D level, and then
re-render it into a 2D image from a specified view. This process introduces
geometric controls such as shape or view. The rendered image, serving as
geometric control, is combined with style and content control achieved through
diffusion adapters, ultimately producing geometrically controlled,
style-consistent edited images via the diffusion model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CustomEnhancer is a zero-shot enhancement framework that improves text-to-image diffusion models for human photo synthesis by combining face swapping, triple-flow fusion, and a novel inversion method called ResInversion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image diffusion models for human photo synthesis face issues with degraded scenes, insufficient control, and suboptimal perceptual identity, which CustomEnhancer aims to address.

Method: The framework uses face swapping techniques and pretrained diffusion models to obtain additional representations. It employs a triple-flow fused PerGeneration approach that combines two counter-directional latent spaces to manipulate personalized models, and introduces ResInversion for efficient noise rectification.

Result: Experiments show CustomEnhancer achieves state-of-the-art results in scene diversity, identity fidelity, and training-free controls, with ResInversion reducing inversion time by 129 times compared to null-text inversion.

Conclusion: CustomEnhancer provides an effective solution for enhancing identity customization models with improved control, fidelity, and efficiency, making it a promising approach for realistic human photo synthesis.

Abstract: Recently remarkable progress has been made in synthesizing realistic human
photos using text-to-image diffusion models. However, current approaches face
degraded scenes, insufficient control, and suboptimal perceptual identity. We
introduce CustomEnhancer, a novel framework to augment existing identity
customization models. CustomEnhancer is a zero-shot enhancement pipeline that
leverages face swapping techniques, pretrained diffusion model, to obtain
additional representations in a zeroshot manner for encoding into personalized
models. Through our proposed triple-flow fused PerGeneration approach, which
identifies and combines two compatible counter-directional latent spaces to
manipulate a pivotal space of personalized model, we unify the generation and
reconstruction processes, realizing generation from three flows. Our pipeline
also enables comprehensive training-free control over the generation process of
personalized models, offering precise controlled personalization for them and
eliminating the need for controller retraining for per-model. Besides, to
address the high time complexity of null-text inversion (NTI), we introduce
ResInversion, a novel inversion method that performs noise rectification via a
pre-diffusion mechanism, reducing the inversion time by 129 times. Experiments
demonstrate that CustomEnhancer reach SOTA results at scene diversity, identity
fidelity, training-free controls, while also showing the efficiency of our
ResInversion over NTI. The code will be made publicly available upon paper
acceptance.

### [25] [Dual-supervised Asymmetric Co-training for Semi-supervised Medical Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20785)
*Jincai Song,Haipeng Chen,Jun Qin,Na Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) framework for cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization (CD-SSDG) in medical image segmentation, addressing domain shifts between labeled/unlabeled training data and training/testing sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional SSDG methods assume labeled and unlabeled data are available for each source domain, but real-world scenarios often have domain shifts between labeled and unlabeled training data, leading to inaccurate pseudolabels and sub-optimal performance.

Method: DAC framework builds on co-training with two sub-models providing cross pseudo supervision, integrating feature-level supervision and asymmetric auxiliary self-supervised tasks to address inaccurate pseudolabels and enhance domain-invariant feature learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on Fundus, Polyp, and SCGM medical image datasets demonstrate the robust generalizability of the proposed DAC framework in CD-SSDG scenarios.

Conclusion: The DAC framework effectively handles the practical challenge of domain shifts between labeled and unlabeled training data in semi-supervised domain generalization for medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) in medical image segmentation
offers a promising solution for generalizing to unseen domains during testing,
addressing domain shift challenges and minimizing annotation costs. However,
conventional SSDG methods assume labeled and unlabeled data are available for
each source domain in the training set, a condition that is not always met in
practice. The coexistence of limited annotation and domain shift in the
training set is a prevalent issue. Thus, this paper explores a more practical
and challenging scenario, cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization
(CD-SSDG), where domain shifts occur between labeled and unlabeled training
data, in addition to shifts between training and testing sets. Existing SSDG
methods exhibit sub-optimal performance under such domain shifts because of
inaccurate pseudolabels. To address this issue, we propose a novel
dual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) framework tailored for CD-SSDG.
Building upon the co-training paradigm with two sub-models offering cross
pseudo supervision, our DAC framework integrates extra feature-level
supervision and asymmetric auxiliary tasks for each sub-model. This
feature-level supervision serves to address inaccurate pseudo supervision
caused by domain shifts between labeled and unlabeled data, utilizing
complementary supervision from the rich feature space. Additionally, two
distinct auxiliary self-supervised tasks are integrated into each sub-model to
enhance domain-invariant discriminative feature learning and prevent model
collapse. Extensive experiments on real-world medical image segmentation
datasets, i.e., Fundus, Polyp, and SCGM, demonstrate the robust
generalizability of the proposed DAC framework.

*Shihua Huang,Yongjie Hou,Longfei Liu,Xuanlong Yu,Xi Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEIMv2 extends the DEIM framework with DINOv3 features, creating a unified architecture spanning eight model sizes from X to Atto. It achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse deployment scenarios with superior parameter efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build upon the success of DEIM's Dense O2O and MAL framework, which significantly outperforms YOLO series, by incorporating DINOv3 features to create a more efficient and scalable detection system covering GPU, edge, and mobile deployments.

Method: For larger models (X, L, M, S): use DINOv3-pretrained/distilled backbones with Spatial Tuning Adapter (STA) to convert single-scale to multi-scale features. For ultra-lightweight models (Nano, Pico, Femto, Atto): employ HGNetv2 with depth/width pruning, simplified decoder, and upgraded Dense O2O.

Result: DEIMv2-X achieves 57.8 AP with 50.3M parameters, surpassing prior X-scale models. DEIMv2-S is first sub-10M model (9.71M) to exceed 50 AP (50.9 AP). DEIMv2-Pico (1.5M) delivers 38.5 AP, matching YOLOv10-Nano (2.3M) with 50% fewer parameters.

Conclusion: DEIMv2 establishes new state-of-the-art results with superior performance-cost trade-off across diverse scenarios, demonstrating exceptional parameter efficiency and scalability from high-end to ultra-lightweight deployments.

Abstract: Benefiting from the simplicity and effectiveness of Dense O2O and MAL, DEIM
has become the mainstream training framework for real-time DETRs, significantly
outperforming the YOLO series. In this work, we extend it with DINOv3 features,
resulting in DEIMv2. DEIMv2 spans eight model sizes from X to Atto, covering
GPU, edge, and mobile deployment. For the X, L, M, and S variants, we adopt
DINOv3-pretrained or distilled backbones and introduce a Spatial Tuning Adapter
(STA), which efficiently converts DINOv3's single-scale output into multi-scale
features and complements strong semantics with fine-grained details to enhance
detection. For ultra-lightweight models (Nano, Pico, Femto, and Atto), we
employ HGNetv2 with depth and width pruning to meet strict resource budgets.
Together with a simplified decoder and an upgraded Dense O2O, this unified
design enables DEIMv2 to achieve a superior performance-cost trade-off across
diverse scenarios, establishing new state-of-the-art results. Notably, our
largest model, DEIMv2-X, achieves 57.8 AP with only 50.3 million parameters,
surpassing prior X-scale models that require over 60 million parameters for
just 56.5 AP. On the compact side, DEIMv2-S is the first sub-10 million model
(9.71 million) to exceed the 50 AP milestone on COCO, reaching 50.9 AP. Even
the ultra-lightweight DEIMv2-Pico, with just 1.5 million parameters, delivers
38.5 AP, matching YOLOv10-Nano (2.3 million) with around 50 percent fewer
parameters.

*Ved Umrajkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAC-LoRA is a novel framework that integrates adversarial training into Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA to enhance the robustness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) against adversarial attacks while maintaining clean accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models are critical for safety-sensitive applications but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. CLIP, as a backbone for many VLMs, is particularly high-value target whose vulnerabilities can cascade across the multimodal AI ecosystem. Current PEFT methods enable efficient adaptation but don't address adversarial robustness.

Method: Dynamic Adversarial Curriculum (DAC-LoRA) framework that creates an intelligent curriculum of progressively challenging adversarial attacks. It's guided by the First-Order Stationary Condition (FOSC) and a TRADES-inspired loss, and can be integrated into standard PEFT pipelines.

Result: The method achieves substantial improvements in adversarial robustness without significantly compromising clean accuracy. It provides an effective, lightweight, and broadly applicable solution.

Conclusion: DAC-LoRA demonstrates that adversarial robustness can be effectively integrated into PEFT methods, offering a practical approach to secure VLMs in safety-critical applications while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are foundational to critical applications like
autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and content moderation. While
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA enable their efficient
adaptation to specialized tasks, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that can compromise safety-critical decisions. CLIP, the backbone for
numerous downstream VLMs, is a high-value target whose vulnerabilities can
cascade across the multimodal AI ecosystem. We propose Dynamic Adversarial
Curriculum DAC-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates adversarial training
into PEFT. The core principle of our method i.e. an intelligent curriculum of
progressively challenging attack, is general and can potentially be applied to
any iterative attack method. Guided by the First-Order Stationary Condition
(FOSC) and a TRADES-inspired loss, DAC-LoRA achieves substantial improvements
in adversarial robustness without significantly compromising clean accuracy.
Our work presents an effective, lightweight, and broadly applicable method to
demonstrate that the DAC-LoRA framework can be easily integrated into a
standard PEFT pipeline to significantly enhance robustness.

*Jianhan Wu,Xiaoyang Qu,Zhangcheng Huang,Jianzong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedDSPG is a novel federated domain generalization method that generates domain-specific soft prompts from a generative perspective, outperforming existing baselines by addressing limited prompt diversity and unknown domain information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated domain generalization methods based on prompt learning have limited diversity in learned prompts and tend to ignore information from unknown domains, posing challenges for downstream-task adaptation in federated learning settings with domain shifts among clients.

Method: The proposed FedDSPG method introduces domain-specific soft prompts (DSPs) for each domain during training, integrating content and domain knowledge into a generative model across clients. During inference, the generator produces DSPs for unseen target domains to guide downstream tasks.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations across several public datasets confirm that FedDSPG outperforms existing strong baselines in federated domain generalization, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: The generative perspective for handling federated domain generalization tasks with domain-specific soft prompt generation proves effective, addressing the limitations of existing prompt learning methods and demonstrating superior performance in adapting to unknown domains.

Abstract: Prompt learning has become an efficient paradigm for adapting CLIP to
downstream tasks. Compared with traditional fine-tuning, prompt learning
optimizes a few parameters yet yields highly competitive results, especially
appealing in federated learning for computational efficiency. engendering
domain shift among clients and posing a formidable challenge for
downstream-task adaptation. Existing federated domain generalization (FDG)
methods based on prompt learning typically learn soft prompts from training
samples, replacing manually designed prompts to enhance the generalization
ability of federated models. However, these learned prompts exhibit limited
diversity and tend to ignore information from unknown domains. We propose a
novel and effective method from a generative perspective for handling FDG
tasks, namely federated domain generalization with domain-specific soft prompts
generation (FedDSPG). Specifically, during training, we introduce
domain-specific soft prompts (DSPs) for each domain and integrate content and
domain knowledge into the generative model among clients. In the inference
phase, the generator is utilized to obtain DSPs for unseen target domains, thus
guiding downstream tasks in unknown domains. Comprehensive evaluations across
several public datasets confirm that our method outperforms existing strong
baselines in FDG, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: LumbarCLIP provides a promising foundation for automated musculoskeletal diagnosis and clinical decision support systems.

Abstract: Low back pain affects millions worldwide, driving the need for robust
diagnostic models that can jointly analyze complex medical images and
accompanying text reports. We present LumbarCLIP, a novel multimodal framework
that leverages contrastive language-image pretraining to align lumbar spine MRI
scans with corresponding radiological descriptions. Built upon a curated
dataset containing axial MRI views paired with expert-written reports,
LumbarCLIP integrates vision encoders (ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, Swin
Transformer) with a BERT-based text encoder to extract dense representations.
These are projected into a shared embedding space via learnable projection
heads, configurable as linear or non-linear, and normalized to facilitate
stable contrastive training using a soft CLIP loss. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on downstream classification, reaching up to
95.00% accuracy and 94.75% F1-score on the test set, despite inherent class
imbalance. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate that linear projection heads
yield more effective cross-modal alignment than non-linear variants. LumbarCLIP
offers a promising foundation for automated musculoskeletal diagnosis and

*Yuxin Cao,Wei Song,Jingling Xue,Jin Song Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoisonVID is the first black-box poisoning attack that targets prompt-guided sampling in VideoLLMs, achieving 82%-99% success rate by compromising frame selection through closed-loop optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While vulnerabilities have been identified in earlier video frame sampling strategies, the safety of the latest prompt-guided sampling approach in VideoLLMs remains unexplored.

Method: PoisonVID uses a closed-loop optimization strategy that iteratively optimizes a universal perturbation to suppress harmful frame relevance scores, guided by a depiction set constructed from paraphrased harmful descriptions using GPT-4o-mini and a shadow VideoLLM.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation on three prompt-guided sampling strategies across three advanced VideoLLMs shows PoisonVID achieves 82% - 99% attack success rate.

Conclusion: The high success rate of PoisonVID highlights the critical need to develop more secure sampling strategies for future VideoLLMs.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
understanding videos, supporting tasks such as summarization, captioning, and
question answering. Their performance has been driven by advances in frame
sampling, progressing from uniform-based to semantic-similarity-based and, most
recently, prompt-guided strategies. While vulnerabilities have been identified
in earlier sampling strategies, the safety of prompt-guided sampling remains
unexplored. We close this gap by presenting PoisonVID, the first black-box
poisoning attack that undermines prompt-guided sampling in VideoLLMs. PoisonVID
compromises the underlying prompt-guided sampling mechanism through a
closed-loop optimization strategy that iteratively optimizes a universal
perturbation to suppress harmful frame relevance scores, guided by a depiction
set constructed from paraphrased harmful descriptions leveraging a shadow
VideoLLM and a lightweight language model, i.e., GPT-4o-mini. Comprehensively
evaluated on three prompt-guided sampling strategies and across three advanced
VideoLLMs, PoisonVID achieves 82% - 99% attack success rate, highlighting the
importance of developing future advanced sampling strategies for VideoLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GoR is a novel learnable regularization method that adaptively balances task-specific and knowledge distillation losses in quantization-aware training using only two trainable parameters, improving performance of small quantized models across various AI tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QAT-KD methods struggle to balance task-specific and distillation losses due to heterogeneous gradient magnitudes, especially under low-bit quantization, leading to performance degradation in compressed models.

Method: Proposes Game of Regularizer (GoR) with two trainable parameters for dynamic loss weighting, and introduces QAT-EKD-GoR ensemble distillation framework using multiple heterogeneous teacher models.

Result: GoR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art QAT-KD methods on image classification, object detection, and LLM compression, delivering faster inference on edge devices while maintaining full-precision accuracy.

Conclusion: GoR provides a robust solution for real-world deployment of compressed AI models, with EKD-GoR capable of outperforming full-precision models under optimal conditions.

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) combined with knowledge distillation (KD)
is a promising strategy for compressing Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for
deployment on resource-constrained hardware. However, existing QAT-KD methods
often struggle to balance task-specific (TS) and distillation losses due to
heterogeneous gradient magnitudes, especially under low-bit quantization. We
propose Game of Regularizer (GoR), a novel learnable regularization method that
adaptively balances TS and KD objectives using only two trainable parameters
for dynamic loss weighting. GoR reduces conflict between supervision signals,
improves convergence, and boosts the performance of small quantized models
(SQMs). Experiments on image classification, object detection (OD), and large
language model (LLM) compression show that GoR consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art QAT-KD methods. On low-power edge devices, it delivers faster
inference while maintaining full-precision accuracy. We also introduce
QAT-EKD-GoR, an ensemble distillation framework that uses multiple
heterogeneous teacher models. Under optimal conditions, the proposed EKD-GoR
can outperform full-precision models, providing a robust solution for
real-world deployment.

TL;DR: The LifeCLEF 2017 plant identification challenge compared using large web-sourced noisy datasets versus smaller expert-verified datasets for automated plant identification across 10,000 species.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether large-scale web-collected datasets with labeling errors can compete with smaller, expert-curated datasets for plant identification, given that most plant species lack comprehensive visual documentation.

Method: Used two training strategies: (1) large noisy dataset from web sources with labeling errors, and (2) smaller trusted dataset verified by experts. Tested on data from Pl@ntNet mobile application as a third independent source.

Result: The challenge assessed performance of both training approaches on continental-scale plant identification with 10,000 species and 1.1M images, comparing web-sourced vs expert-curated data quality.

Conclusion: The study provides analysis of whether noisy web data can effectively substitute for expert-verified datasets in large-scale automated plant identification systems.

Abstract: The 2017-th edition of the LifeCLEF plant identification challenge is an
important milestone towards automated plant identification systems working at
the scale of continental floras with 10.000 plant species living mainly in
Europe and North America illustrated by a total of 1.1M images. Nowadays, such
ambitious systems are enabled thanks to the conjunction of the dazzling recent
progress in image classification with deep learning and several outstanding
international initiatives, such as the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), aggregating
the visual knowledge on plant species coming from the main national botany
institutes. However, despite all these efforts the majority of the plant
species still remain without pictures or are poorly illustrated. Outside the
institutional channels, a much larger number of plant pictures are available
and spread on the web through botanist blogs, plant lovers web-pages, image
hosting websites and on-line plant retailers. The LifeCLEF 2017 plant challenge
presented in this paper aimed at evaluating to what extent a large noisy
training dataset collected through the web and containing a lot of labelling
errors can compete with a smaller but trusted training dataset checked by
experts. To fairly compare both training strategies, the test dataset was
created from a third data source, i.e. the Pl@ntNet mobile application that
collects millions of plant image queries all over the world. This paper
presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge,
summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating research
groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

### [33] [TasselNetV4: A vision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20857)
*Xiaonan Hu,Xuebing Li,Jinyu Xu,Abdulkadir Duran Adan,Letian Zhou,Xuhui Zhu,Yanan Li,Wei Guo,Shouyang Liu,Wenzhong Liu,Hao Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TasselNetV4 is a vision foundation model for cross-species plant counting that combines local counting with extract-and-match paradigm, achieving superior performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art class-agnostic counting models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional plant counting models are species-specific, but plant biodiversity and continuous breeding of new cultivars make it impractical to build models for every species. Current class-agnostic counting models perform poorly on plants due to their dynamic, non-rigid nature that changes with time and space.

Method: TasselNetV4 extends TasselNet by marrying local counting with extract-and-match paradigm from class-agnostic counting. It builds on a plain vision transformer and incorporates novel multi-branch box-aware local counters to enhance cross-scale robustness.

Result: Extensive experiments on PAC-105 and PAC-Somalia datasets show TasselNetV4 achieves superior counting performance and high efficiency compared to state-of-the-art class-agnostic counting models.

Conclusion: TasselNetV4 emerges as a vision foundation model capable of cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant counting, shifting from species-specific to general plant counting approaches.

Abstract: Accurate plant counting provides valuable information for agriculture such as
crop yield prediction, plant density assessment, and phenotype quantification.
Vision-based approaches are currently the mainstream solution. Prior art
typically uses a detection or a regression model to count a specific plant.
However, plants have biodiversity, and new cultivars are increasingly bred each
year. It is almost impossible to exhaust and build all species-dependent
counting models. Inspired by class-agnostic counting (CAC) in computer vision,
we argue that it is time to rethink the problem formulation of plant counting,
from what plants to count to how to count plants. In contrast to most daily
objects with spatial and temporal invariance, plants are dynamic, changing with
time and space. Their non-rigid structure often leads to worse performance than
counting rigid instances like heads and cars such that current CAC and
open-world detection models are suboptimal to count plants. In this work, we
inherit the vein of the TasselNet plant counting model and introduce a new
extension, TasselNetV4, shifting from species-specific counting to
cross-species counting. TasselNetV4 marries the local counting idea of
TasselNet with the extract-and-match paradigm in CAC. It builds upon a plain
vision transformer and incorporates novel multi-branch box-aware local counters
used to enhance cross-scale robustness. Two challenging datasets, PAC-105 and
PAC-Somalia, are harvested. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art CAC
models show that TasselNetV4 achieves not only superior counting performance
but also high efficiency.Our results indicate that TasselNetV4 emerges to be a
vision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant
counting.

TL;DR: A novel semi-supervised model for retinal OCT segmentation that introduces a differentiable biomarker topology engine to enforce anatomically correct segmentation of layers and lesions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semi-supervised learning methods for retinal OCT segmentation often produce anatomically implausible results, fail to effectively model layer-lesion interactions, and lack guarantees on topological correctness.

Method: Proposes a semi-supervised model with a fully differentiable biomarker topology engine that enables joint learning with bidirectional influence between layers and lesions. Uses disentangled representation learning to separate spatial and style factors, enforcing lesion locations in anatomically plausible positions relative to segmented layers.

Result: Outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on public and internal OCT datasets for both lesion and layer segmentation. Demonstrates ability to generalize layer segmentation to pathological cases using partially annotated training data.

Conclusion: Shows the potential of using anatomical constraints in semi-supervised learning for accurate, robust, and trustworthy retinal biomarker segmentation.

Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is widely used for diagnosing and
monitoring retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
The segmentation of biomarkers such as layers and lesions is essential for
patient diagnosis and follow-up. Recently, semi-supervised learning has shown
promise in improving retinal segmentation performance. However, existing
methods often produce anatomically implausible segmentations, fail to
effectively model layer-lesion interactions, and lack guarantees on topological
correctness.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel semi-supervised model that
introduces a fully differentiable biomarker topology engine to enforce
anatomically correct segmentation of lesions and layers. This enables joint
learning with bidirectional influence between layers and lesions, leveraging
unlabeled and diverse partially labeled datasets. Our model learns a
disentangled representation, separating spatial and style factors. This
approach enables more realistic layer segmentations and improves lesion
segmentation, while strictly enforcing lesion location in their anatomically
plausible positions relative to the segmented layers.
  We evaluate the proposed model on public and internal datasets of OCT scans
and show that it outperforms the current state-of-the-art in both lesion and
layer segmentation, while demonstrating the ability to generalize layer
segmentation to pathological cases using partially annotated training data. Our
results demonstrate the potential of using anatomical constraints in
semi-supervised learning for accurate, robust, and trustworthy retinal
biomarker segmentation.

TL;DR: The LifeCLEF 2016 plant identification challenge evaluated large-scale plant recognition systems on 110K+ images of 1000 species, focusing on open-set recognition to handle unknown categories not seen during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create realistic biodiversity monitoring scenarios by testing plant identification methods at large scale with real-world conditions, including the challenge of rejecting false positives from unknown plant species.

Method: Used a dataset built through participatory sensing with tens of thousands of contributors, evaluating systems on their ability to perform open-set recognition - classifying known species while automatically rejecting images of unknown species.

Result: The challenge successfully tested various approaches for large-scale plant identification under realistic conditions where systems must be robust to unknown categories not present in the training data.

Conclusion: The 2016 edition advanced plant identification research by introducing open-set recognition as a key evaluation criterion, moving closer to real-world biodiversity monitoring scenarios where unknown species are encountered.

Abstract: The LifeCLEF plant identification challenge aims at evaluating plant
identification methods and systems at a very large scale, close to the
conditions of a real-world biodiversity monitoring scenario. The 2016-th
edition was actually conducted on a set of more than 110K images illustrating
1000 plant species living in West Europe, built through a large-scale
participatory sensing platform initiated in 2011 and which now involves tens of
thousands of contributors. The main novelty over the previous years is that the
identification task was evaluated as an open-set recognition problem, i.e. a
problem in which the recognition system has to be robust to unknown and never
seen categories. Beyond the brute-force classification across the known classes
of the training set, the big challenge was thus to automatically reject the
false positive classification hits that are caused by the unknown classes. This
overview presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the
challenge, summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating
research groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCRA-VQA is a method that improves KB-VQA by using LLMs as knowledge engines with enhanced caption processing. It converts images to captions, then summarizes and reorders them to remove noise, enabling better reasoning without expensive training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current KB-VQA methods using LLMs with image captions suffer from excessive noise in captions and LLMs' poor comprehension of VQA tasks, limiting reasoning capabilities.

Method: Proposes SCRA-VQA which uses a pre-trained visual language model to generate captions, then summarizes and reorders them to exclude unrelated information. Also generates contextual examples for captions to enhance LLM understanding.

Result: Achieves 38.8% accuracy on OK-VQA and 34.6% on A-OKVQA using a 6.7B parameter LLM, showing excellent performance on challenging KB-VQA datasets.

Conclusion: SCRA-VQA's caption-rerank process enhances LLMs' reasoning ability and task adaptability for KB-VQA without requiring expensive end-to-end training, demonstrating effective knowledge acquisition.

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality knowledge is a central focus in Knowledge-Based Visual
Question Answering (KB-VQA). Recent methods use large language models (LLMs) as
knowledge engines for answering. These methods generally employ image captions
as visual text descriptions to assist LLMs in interpreting images. However, the
captions frequently include excessive noise irrelevant to the question, and
LLMs generally do not comprehend VQA tasks, limiting their reasoning
capabilities. To address this issue, we propose the Summarized Caption-Rerank
Augmented VQA (SCRA-VQA), which employs a pre-trained visual language model to
convert images into captions. Moreover, SCRA-VQA generates contextual examples
for the captions while simultaneously summarizing and reordering them to
exclude unrelated information. The caption-rerank process enables LLMs to
understand the image information and questions better, thus enhancing the
model's reasoning ability and task adaptability without expensive end-to-end
training. Based on an LLM with 6.7B parameters, SCRA-VQA performs excellently
on two challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets: OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, achieving
accuracies of 38.8% and 34.6%. Our code is available at

*Jiabei Zhang,Qi Wang,Siyu Wu,Du Chen,Tianhe Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper reveals an asymmetry between perceptual optimization and image quality assessment (IQA), showing that fidelity metrics effective for IQA don't necessarily work well for optimization, especially under adversarial training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically analyze the correlation between optimization objectives' effectiveness and their capability as IQA metrics, which remains underexplored despite their central role in perceptual optimization.

Method: Conducted systematic analysis comparing fidelity metrics and adversarial objectives, examining their performance in both optimization and assessment contexts, with specific focus on discriminator design variations including patch-level, convolutional, and Transformer-based architectures.

Result: Found that fidelity metrics excelling in IQA are not effective for perceptual optimization, particularly under adversarial training. Discriminator design significantly impacts optimization quality, with patch-level and convolutional architectures providing better detail reconstruction than vanilla or Transformer-based alternatives.

Conclusion: The discovered asymmetry between optimization and assessment advances understanding of loss function design and IQA transferability, providing foundations for more principled approaches to perceptual optimization.

Abstract: Perceptual optimization is primarily driven by the fidelity objective, which
enforces both semantic consistency and overall visual realism, while the
adversarial objective provides complementary refinement by enhancing perceptual
sharpness and fine-grained detail. Despite their central role, the correlation
between their effectiveness as optimization objectives and their capability as
image quality assessment (IQA) metrics remains underexplored. In this work, we
conduct a systematic analysis and reveal an unanticipated asymmetry between
perceptual optimization and assessment: fidelity metrics that excel in IQA are
not necessarily effective for perceptual optimization, with this misalignment
emerging more distinctly under adversarial training. In addition, while
discriminators effectively suppress artifacts during optimization, their
learned representations offer only limited benefits when reused as backbone
initializations for IQA models. Beyond this asymmetry, our findings further
demonstrate that discriminator design plays a decisive role in shaping
optimization, with patch-level and convolutional architectures providing more
faithful detail reconstruction than vanilla or Transformer-based alternatives.
These insights advance the understanding of loss function design and its
connection to IQA transferability, paving the way for more principled
approaches to perceptual optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQA models struggle with biases from training data, leading to over-reliance on superficial patterns and poor generalization to diverse questions and images.

Method: The model combines Object Interaction Self-Attention to capture complex object interactions within images, and a GAN-Based Debiasing framework to generate unbiased data distributions for learning robust features.

Result: Extensive experiments on VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets show excellent performance compared to existing methods, particularly in handling biased and imbalanced data distributions.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the importance of addressing both object interactions and dataset biases to advance VQA tasks, demonstrating that IOG-VQA effectively combines visual and textual information to mitigate inherent biases.

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) presents a unique challenge by requiring
models to understand and reason about visual content to answer questions
accurately. Existing VQA models often struggle with biases introduced by the
training data, leading to over-reliance on superficial patterns and inadequate
generalization to diverse questions and images. This paper presents a novel
model, IOG-VQA, which integrates Object Interaction Self-Attention and
GAN-Based Debiasing to enhance VQA model performance. The self-attention
mechanism allows our model to capture complex interactions between objects
within an image, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the visual
context. Meanwhile, the GAN-based debiasing framework generates unbiased data
distributions, helping the model to learn more robust and generalizable
features. By leveraging these two components, IOG-VQA effectively combines
visual and textual information to address the inherent biases in VQA datasets.
Extensive experiments on the VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets demonstrate that
our model shows excellent performance compared with the existing methods,
particularly in handling biased and imbalanced data distributions highlighting
the importance of addressing both object interactions and dataset biases in
advancing VQA tasks. Our code is available at

TL;DR: Nuclear Diffusion is a hybrid framework combining low-rank temporal modeling with diffusion posterior sampling for video dehazing, showing improved performance in medical ultrasound imaging compared to traditional RPCA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional robust principal component analysis (RPCA) methods struggle with real video data because the sparsity assumption fails to capture the rich variability present in dynamic content, particularly when dealing with structured noise and background artifacts that obscure important information.

Method: The proposed Nuclear Diffusion method integrates low-rank temporal modeling with diffusion posterior sampling, creating a hybrid framework that combines model-based temporal models with deep generative priors for more effective video restoration.

Result: Evaluation on cardiac ultrasound dehazing demonstrates improved performance over traditional RPCA, with better contrast enhancement (measured by gCNR) and superior signal preservation (measured by KS statistic).

Conclusion: The results highlight the potential of combining model-based temporal models with deep generative priors for achieving high-fidelity video restoration, particularly in challenging applications like medical imaging where accurate analysis is critical.

Abstract: Video sequences often contain structured noise and background artifacts that
obscure dynamic content, posing challenges for accurate analysis and
restoration. Robust principal component methods address this by decomposing
data into low-rank and sparse components. Still, the sparsity assumption often
fails to capture the rich variability present in real video data. To overcome
this limitation, a hybrid framework that integrates low-rank temporal modeling
with diffusion posterior sampling is proposed. The proposed method, Nuclear
Diffusion, is evaluated on a real-world medical imaging problem, namely cardiac
ultrasound dehazing, and demonstrates improved dehazing performance compared to
traditional RPCA concerning contrast enhancement (gCNR) and signal preservation
(KS statistic). These results highlight the potential of combining model-based
temporal models with deep generative priors for high-fidelity video
restoration.

Result: Achieves 97.1% average accuracy on open-world benchmark with 22 generative models, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 10.6%.

Conclusion: FerretNet provides efficient and robust synthetic image detection by focusing on fundamental generation artifacts rather than model-specific features.

Abstract: The increasing realism of synthetic images generated by advanced models such
as VAEs, GANs, and LDMs poses significant challenges for synthetic image
detection. To address this issue, we explore two artifact types introduced
during the generation process: (1) latent distribution deviations and (2)
decoding-induced smoothing effects, which manifest as inconsistencies in local
textures, edges, and color transitions. Leveraging local pixel dependencies
(LPD) properties rooted in Markov Random Fields, we reconstruct synthetic
images using neighboring pixel information to expose disruptions in texture
continuity and edge coherence. Building upon LPD, we propose FerretNet, a
lightweight neural network with only 1.1M parameters that delivers efficient
and robust synthetic image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FerretNet, trained exclusively on the 4-class ProGAN dataset, achieves an
average accuracy of 97.1% on an open-world benchmark comprising across 22
generative models, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 10.6%.

*Patrick Knab,Sascha Marton,Philipp J. Schubert,Drago Guggiana,Christian Bartelt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoTIF extends Concept Bottleneck Models to video classification by handling temporal dependencies and providing interpretable concept analysis across global, local, and temporal perspectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending interpretable concept-based models from static images to video data is challenging due to temporal dependencies essential for capturing actions and events in videos.

Method: MoTIF uses a transformer-inspired architecture that adapts concept bottleneck framework for video classification, handling sequences of arbitrary length and identifying recurring semantic concepts (motifs) across time.

Result: The framework successfully transfers concept-based modeling to video data, enabling better understanding of concept contributions in temporal contexts while maintaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: Concept-based modeling can be effectively applied to video classification, providing interpretable insights through global concept importance, local concept relevance, and temporal dependencies analysis.

Abstract: Conceptual models such as Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have driven
substantial progress in improving interpretability for image classification by
leveraging human-interpretable concepts. However, extending these models from
static images to sequences of images, such as video data, introduces a
significant challenge due to the temporal dependencies inherent in videos,
which are essential for capturing actions and events. In this work, we
introduce MoTIF (Moving Temporal Interpretable Framework), an architectural
design inspired by a transformer that adapts the concept bottleneck framework
for video classification and handles sequences of arbitrary length. Within the
video domain, concepts refer to semantic entities such as objects, attributes,
or higher-level components (e.g., 'bow', 'mount', 'shoot') that reoccur across
time - forming motifs collectively describing and explaining actions. Our
design explicitly enables three complementary perspectives: global concept
importance across the entire video, local concept relevance within specific
windows, and temporal dependencies of a concept over time. Our results
demonstrate that the concept-based modeling paradigm can be effectively
transferred to video data, enabling a better understanding of concept
contributions in temporal contexts while maintaining competitive performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Particle filters enable 3D object localization from camera sequences for distant objects where traditional depth estimation and 3D reconstruction methods fail, particularly useful for drone-based wildfire monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D object localization methods (dense depth estimation and 3D scene reconstruction) are infeasible for distant objects or computationally constrained tasks like drone-based wildfire monitoring, requiring an alternative solution.

Method: Using particle filters for both single and multiple target scenarios, with evaluation through 3D simulation and drone-based image segmentation sequences using GNSS-based camera pose estimates.

Result: Particle filters successfully solved practical localization tasks using camera poses and image segments in situations where other methods fail, demonstrating flexibility across detection methods.

Conclusion: The proposed particle filter method enables effective drone-based wildfire monitoring when paired with existing image segmentation models, providing a viable solution for safety-critical surveillance tasks with computational constraints.

Abstract: 3D object localisation based on a sequence of camera measurements is
essential for safety-critical surveillance tasks, such as drone-based wildfire
monitoring. Localisation of objects detected with a camera can typically be
solved with dense depth estimation or 3D scene reconstruction. However, in the
context of distant objects or tasks limited by the amount of available
computational resources, neither solution is feasible. In this paper, we show
that the task can be solved using particle filters for both single and multiple
target scenarios. The method was studied using a 3D simulation and a
drone-based image segmentation sequence with global navigation satellite system
(GNSS)-based camera pose estimates. The results showed that a particle filter
can be used to solve practical localisation tasks based on camera poses and
image segments in these situations where other solutions fail. The particle
filter is independent of the detection method, making it flexible for new
tasks. The study also demonstrates that drone-based wildfire monitoring can be
conducted using the proposed method paired with a pre-existing image
segmentation model.

*Qinfeng Zhu,Han Li,Liang He,Lei Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SwinMamba is a novel framework that combines local Mamba-style scanning in shifted windows with global receptive fields to improve semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery by capturing both fine-grained local details and broader contextual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Mamba's global scanning approach tends to overlook critical local features like textures and edges, which are essential for accurate segmentation in remote sensing data with complex scene structures and diverse object scales.

Method: SwinMamba integrates localized Mamba-style scanning within shifted windows (first two stages) with global scanning (last two stages), using overlapping shifted windows to enhance inter-region information exchange and feature integration across the entire image.

Result: Extensive experiments on LoveDA and ISPRS Potsdam datasets show that SwinMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods in semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery.

Conclusion: SwinMamba demonstrates effectiveness and potential as a superior solution for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed imagery by successfully balancing local feature capture with global contextual understanding.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery is a fundamental task in
computer vision, supporting a wide range of applications such as land use
classification, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. However, this
task is often challenged by the high spatial resolution, complex scene
structures, and diverse object scales present in remote sensing data. To
address these challenges, various deep learning architectures have been
proposed, including convolutional neural networks, Vision Transformers, and the
recently introduced Vision Mamba. Vision Mamba features a global receptive
field and low computational complexity, demonstrating both efficiency and
effectiveness in image segmentation. However, its reliance on global scanning
tends to overlook critical local features, such as textures and edges, which
are essential for achieving accurate segmentation in remote sensing contexts.
To tackle this limitation, we propose SwinMamba, a novel framework inspired by
the Swin Transformer. SwinMamba integrates localized Mamba-style scanning
within shifted windows with a global receptive field, to enhance the model's
perception of both local and global features. Specifically, the first two
stages of SwinMamba perform local scanning to capture fine-grained details,
while its subsequent two stages leverage global scanning to fuse broader
contextual information. In our model, the use of overlapping shifted windows
enhances inter-region information exchange, facilitating more robust feature
integration across the entire image. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA and
ISPRS Potsdam datasets demonstrate that SwinMamba outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, underscoring its effectiveness and potential as a superior solution
for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed imagery.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PackMIL: A pack-based multiple instance learning framework that addresses computational pathology challenges by packing variable-length WSI sequences into fixed-length batches, using residual branches and attention-driven downsampling to improve efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Whole slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology have extreme sequence length variations (200-200K), high data heterogeneity, redundancy, and limited supervision, which conventional methods struggle to handle efficiently.

Method: Proposes a pack-based MIL framework that packs multiple variable-length feature sequences into fixed-length ones for batched training, with a residual branch that composes discarded features into hyperslides, and an attention-driven downsampler to reduce redundancy.

Result: Achieves up to 8% accuracy improvement while using only 12% of training time compared to PANDA(UNI) baseline, demonstrating significant efficiency and performance gains.

Conclusion: Addressing data challenges in computational pathology through the proposed framework shows significant potential for foundation models, offering improved training efficiency and accuracy while preserving data heterogeneity.

Abstract: Computational pathology (CPath) digitizes pathology slides into whole slide
images (WSIs), enabling analysis for critical healthcare tasks such as cancer
diagnosis and prognosis. However, WSIs possess extremely long sequence lengths
(up to 200K), significant length variations (from 200 to 200K), and limited
supervision. These extreme variations in sequence length lead to high data
heterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods often compromise on training
efficiency and optimization to preserve such heterogeneity under limited
supervision. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a
pack-based MIL framework. It packs multiple sampled, variable-length feature
sequences into fixed-length ones, enabling batched training while preserving
data heterogeneity. Moreover, we introduce a residual branch that composes
discarded features from multiple slides into a hyperslide which is trained with
tailored labels. It offers multi-slide supervision while mitigating feature
loss from sampling. Meanwhile, an attention-driven downsampler is introduced to
compress features in both branches to reduce redundancy. By alleviating these
challenges, our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 8% while
using only 12% of the training time in the PANDA(UNI). Extensive experiments
demonstrate that focusing data challenges in CPath holds significant potential
in the era of foundation models. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimDiff is a Simulator-constrained Diffusion Model that generates physically plausible human motion by integrating environment parameters directly into the denoising process, eliminating the need for computationally expensive simulator calls at inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches use simulator-based motion projection layers that are computationally expensive due to sequential processing that prevents parallelization. There's a need for more efficient methods to generate physically plausible human motion.

Method: The paper proposes SimDiff, which interprets simulator-based motion projection as guidance within the diffusion process. It integrates environment parameters (gravity, wind) directly into the denoising process, enabling efficient generation without repeated simulator calls.

Result: SimDiff generates physically plausible motions efficiently without simulator calls at inference, provides fine-grained control over physical coefficients, and demonstrates compositional generalization to unseen combinations of environmental parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed SimDiff framework successfully generates physically plausible human motion with computational efficiency and compositional generalization capabilities, offering a practical solution for character animation and virtual reality applications.

Abstract: Generating physically plausible human motion is crucial for applications such
as character animation and virtual reality. Existing approaches often
incorporate a simulator-based motion projection layer to the diffusion process
to enforce physical plausibility. However, such methods are computationally
expensive due to the sequential nature of the simulator, which prevents
parallelization. We show that simulator-based motion projection can be
interpreted as a form of guidance, either classifier-based or classifier-free,
within the diffusion process. Building on this insight, we propose SimDiff, a
Simulator-constrained Diffusion Model that integrates environment parameters
(e.g., gravity, wind) directly into the denoising process. By conditioning on
these parameters, SimDiff generates physically plausible motions efficiently,
without repeated simulator calls at inference, and also provides fine-grained
control over different physical coefficients. Moreover, SimDiff successfully
generalizes to unseen combinations of environmental parameters, demonstrating
compositional generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates architectural design choices that make vision models more robust to Gaussian noise, identifying four key patterns and providing theoretical explanations for why they work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why certain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian noise and convert these empirical insights into actionable design rules for building more robust vision models.

Method: Extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained vision models, empirical identification of design patterns, followed by theoretical analysis including proofs about low-pass stem kernels, downsampling effects, pooling comparisons, and Lipschitz bounds for CLIP ViTs.

Result: Identified four consistent design patterns: larger stem kernels, smaller input resolutions, average pooling, and supervised ViTs over CLIP ViTs, yielding up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6% accuracy gains. Provided theoretical explanations showing how these choices attenuate noise and reduce sensitivity.

Conclusion: The research disentangles robustness into interpretable modules, provides a theory explaining observed trends, and offers practical plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more robust against Gaussian noise.

Abstract: While the robustness of vision models is often measured, their dependence on
specific architectural design choices is rarely dissected. We investigate why
certain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian
noise and convert these empirical insights into simple, actionable design
rules. Specifically, we performed extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained
vision models, empirically identifying four consistent design patterns for
improved robustness against Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input
resolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers (ViTs) rather
than CLIP ViTs, which yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6\%p accuracy
gains. We then develop a theoretical analysis that explains these findings,
converting observed correlations into causal mechanisms. First, we prove that
low-pass stem kernels attenuate noise with a gain that decreases quadratically
with kernel size and that anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy
roughly in proportion to the square of the downsampling factor. Second, we
demonstrate that average pooling is unbiased and suppresses noise in proportion
to the pooling window area, whereas max pooling incurs a positive bias that
grows slowly with window size and yields a relatively higher mean-squared error
and greater worst-case sensitivity. Third, we reveal and explain the
vulnerability of CLIP ViTs via a pixel-space Lipschitz bound: The smaller
normalization standard deviations used in CLIP preprocessing amplify worst-case
sensitivity by up to 1.91 times relative to the Inception-style preprocessing
common in supervised ViTs. Our results collectively disentangle robustness into
interpretable modules, provide a theory that explains the observed trends, and
build practical, plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more
robust against Gaussian noise.

Abstract: Scene graphs (SGs) provide structured relational representations crucial for
decoding complex, dynamic surgical environments. This PRISMA-ScR-guided scoping
review systematically maps the evolving landscape of SG research in surgery,
charting its applications, methodological advancements, and future directions.
Our analysis reveals rapid growth, yet uncovers a critical 'data divide':
internal-view research (e.g., triplet recognition) almost exclusively uses
real-world 2D video, while external-view 4D modeling relies heavily on
simulated data, exposing a key translational research gap. Methodologically,
the field has advanced from foundational graph neural networks to specialized
foundation models that now significantly outperform generalist large

Motivation: Extracting insights from lengthy (30-40 minute) multimodal financial advisory content is challenging due to the difficulty in processing both audio/visual and textual information efficiently.

Method: FASTER uses BLIP for visual descriptions, OCR for text patterns, Whisper transcription with speaker diarization, a modified DPO loss function with fact-checking, and a ranker-based retrieval mechanism to align keyframes with summarized content.

Result: Comprehensive cross-domain experiments show FASTER outperforms LLMs and VLMs in performance, robustness, and generalizability for multimodal summarization tasks.

Conclusion: FASTER establishes a new standard for multimodal summarization, making financial advisory content more accessible and actionable while introducing the Fin-APT dataset to address data scarcity in this domain.

Abstract: The dynamic propagation of social media has broadened the reach of financial
advisory content through podcast videos, yet extracting insights from lengthy,
multimodal segments (30-40 minutes) remains challenging. We introduce FASTER
(Financial Advisory Summariser with Textual Embedded Relevant images), a
modular framework that tackles three key challenges: (1) extracting
modality-specific features, (2) producing optimized, concise summaries, and (3)
aligning visual keyframes with associated textual points. FASTER employs BLIP
for semantic visual descriptions, OCR for textual patterns, and Whisper-based
transcription with Speaker diarization as BOS features. A modified Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO)-based loss function, equipped with BOS-specific
fact-checking, ensures precision, relevance, and factual consistency against
the human-aligned summary. A ranker-based retrieval mechanism further aligns
keyframes with summarized content, enhancing interpretability and cross-modal
coherence. To acknowledge data resource scarcity, we introduce Fin-APT, a
dataset comprising 470 publicly accessible financial advisory pep-talk videos
for robust multimodal research. Comprehensive cross-domain experiments confirm
FASTER's strong performance, robustness, and generalizability when compared to
Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By establishing

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SSL-integrated deep clustering frameworks require pretraining, clustering learning, or trained models as prerequisites, limiting flexible and out-of-box application of SSL learners in image clustering tasks.

Method: ASD randomly samples pseudo-labeled data, uses instance-level classifier to learn them, tracks class transitions to extract high-level similarities, assigns cluster-level labels to pseudo-labeled data, and triggers SSL learner for clustering.

Result: ASD shows superior performance across benchmarks against latest deep image clustering approaches, with very slight accuracy gaps (e.g., only 1.33% on CIFAR-10) compared to SSL methods using ground-truth labels.

Conclusion: ASD enables effective cold-start SSL for image clustering without prerequisites and can further boost existing SSL-embedded deep image clustering methods.

Abstract: Recently, some works integrate SSL techniques into deep clustering frameworks
to enhance image clustering performance. However, they all need pretraining,
clustering learning, or a trained clustering model as prerequisites, limiting
the flexible and out-of-box application of SSL learners in the image clustering
task. This work introduces ASD, an adaptor that enables the cold-start of SSL
learners for deep image clustering without any prerequisites. Specifically, we
first randomly sample pseudo-labeled data from all unlabeled data, and set an
instance-level classifier to learn them with semantically aligned
instance-level labels. With the ability of instance-level classification, we
track the class transitions of predictions on unlabeled data to extract
high-level similarities of instance-level classes, which can be utilized to
assign cluster-level labels to pseudo-labeled data. Finally, we use the
pseudo-labeled data with assigned cluster-level labels to trigger a general SSL
learner trained on the unlabeled data for image clustering. We show the
superior performance of ASD across various benchmarks against the latest deep
image clustering approaches and very slight accuracy gaps compared to SSL
methods using ground-truth, e.g., only 1.33% on CIFAR-10. Moreover, ASD can
also further boost the performance of existing SSL-embedded deep image

TL;DR: SiNGER is a novel distillation framework that suppresses high-norm artifacts in Vision Transformers while preserving informative signals, improving student model performance through nullspace-guided feature refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers produce high-norm artifacts that degrade representation quality. When knowledge distillation transfers these features to students, artifacts dominate the objective, causing students to overfit to artifacts and underweight informative signals, diminishing gains from larger models.

Method: Singular Nullspace-Guided Energy Reallocation (SiNGER) uses principled teacher feature refinement with nullspace-guided perturbation to preserve information while suppressing artifacts. This is implemented efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter requiring minimal structural modification.

Result: Extensive experiments show SiNGER consistently improves student models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple downstream tasks and producing clearer, more interpretable representations.

Conclusion: SiNGER effectively addresses the trade-off between artifact suppression and signal preservation in knowledge distillation, enabling better transfer of teacher knowledge to student models without the limitations of prior approaches.

Abstract: Vision Transformers are widely adopted as the backbone of vision foundation
models, but they are known to produce high-norm artifacts that degrade
representation quality. When knowledge distillation transfers these features to
students, high-norm artifacts dominate the objective, so students overfit to
artifacts and underweight informative signals, diminishing the gains from
larger models. Prior work attempted to remove artifacts but encountered an
inherent trade-off between artifact suppression and preserving informative
signals from teachers. To address this, we introduce Singular Nullspace-Guided
Energy Reallocation (SiNGER), a novel distillation framework that suppresses
artifacts while preserving informative signals. The key idea is principled
teacher feature refinement: during refinement, we leverage the nullspace-guided
perturbation to preserve information while suppressing artifacts. Then, the
refined teacher's features are distilled to a student. We implement this
perturbation efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter that requires minimal
structural modification. Extensive experiments show that \oursname consistently
improves student models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple
downstream tasks and producing clearer and more interpretable representations.

Result: SNCE achieves state-of-the-art concept erasure performance while preserving generation capabilities for non-target concepts, with strong robustness against adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: The proposed SNCE method enables precise and effective concept erasure with minimal impact on image quality, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Text-to-image models exhibit remarkable capabilities in image generation.
However, they also pose safety risks of generating harmful content. A key
challenge of existing concept erasure methods is the precise removal of target
concepts while minimizing degradation of image quality. In this paper, we
propose Single Neuron-based Concept Erasure (SNCE), a novel approach that can
precisely prevent harmful content generation by manipulating only a single
neuron. Specifically, we train a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to map text
embeddings into a sparse, disentangled latent space, where individual neurons
align tightly with atomic semantic concepts. To accurately locate neurons
responsible for harmful concepts, we design a novel neuron identification
method based on the modulated frequency scoring of activation patterns. By
suppressing activations of the harmful concept-specific neuron, SNCE achieves
surgical precision in concept erasure with minimal disruption to image quality.
Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that SNCE achieves
state-of-the-art results in target concept erasure, while preserving the
model's generation capabilities for non-target concepts. Additionally, our
method exhibits strong robustness against adversarial attacks, significantly
outperforming existing methods.

*Andreas Gilson,Lukas Meyer,Oliver Scholz,Ute Schmid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KD-SS is a lightweight sub-sampling algorithm for plant point clouds that enables full-resolution segmentation without down-sampling, working across different plant species and sensor modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing plant organ segmentation methods are problem-specific, require extensive pre-processing, and force down-sampling of point clouds to meet hardware/network constraints, limiting their generalizability.

Method: Proposes KD-SS (Keypoint Detection-based Sub-Sampling), a simple yet effective algorithm that performs sub-sampling while retaining resolution, allowing segmentation of full-resolution point clouds without the need for down-sampling.

Result: KD-SS combined with state-of-the-art segmentation models shows satisfying results across different modalities (photogrammetry, laser triangulation, LiDAR) and various plant species.

Conclusion: KD-SS serves as a lightweight, resolution-retaining alternative to intensive pre-processing and down-sampling methods for plant organ segmentation, making it agnostic to both plant species and sensor modality.

Abstract: Accurate point cloud segmentation for plant organs is crucial for 3D plant
phenotyping. Existing solutions are designed problem-specific with a focus on
certain plant species or specified sensor-modalities for data acquisition.
Furthermore, it is common to use extensive pre-processing and down-sample the
plant point clouds to meet hardware or neural network input size requirements.
We propose a simple, yet effective algorithm KDSS for sub-sampling of
biological point clouds that is agnostic to sensor data and plant species. The
main benefit of this approach is that we do not need to down-sample our input
data and thus, enable segmentation of the full-resolution point cloud.
Combining KD-SS with current state-of-the-art segmentation models shows
satisfying results evaluated on different modalities such as photogrammetry,
laser triangulation and LiDAR for various plant species. We propose KD-SS as
lightweight resolution-retaining alternative to intensive pre-processing and
down-sampling methods for plant organ segmentation regardless of used species
and sensor modality.

*Songyue Cai,Zongqian Wu,Yujie Mo,Liang Peng,Ping Hu,Xiaoshuang Shi,Xiaofeng Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mambo is a new FG-BG decomposition framework for few-shot out-of-distribution detection that addresses limitations of previous methods by using refined local background similarity and flexible patch selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FG-BG decomposition methods suffer from low robustness due to over-reliance on local class similarity and fixed background patch extraction strategies.

Method: Proposes learning a background prompt to obtain local background similarity, refining it with local class similarity, and using patch self-calibrated tuning for flexible background patch selection based on sample diversity.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show Mambo achieves state-of-the-art performance in OOD detection and near OOD detection settings.

Conclusion: Mambo effectively addresses the limitations of previous methods by reducing dependence on local class similarity and enabling flexible background extraction, demonstrating superior performance in FS-OOD detection.

Abstract: Existing foreground-background (FG-BG) decomposition methods for the few-shot
out-of-distribution (FS-OOD) detection often suffer from low robustness due to
over-reliance on the local class similarity and a fixed background patch
extraction strategy. To address these challenges, we propose a new FG-BG
decomposition framework, namely Mambo, for FS-OOD detection. Specifically, we
propose to first learn a background prompt to obtain the local background
similarity containing both the background and image semantic information, and
then refine the local background similarity using the local class similarity.
As a result, we use both the refined local background similarity and the local
class similarity to conduct background extraction, reducing the dependence of
the local class similarity in previous methods. Furthermore, we propose the
patch self-calibrated tuning to consider the sample diversity to flexibly
select numbers of background patches for different samples, and thus exploring
the issue of fixed background extraction strategies in previous methods.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed
Mambo achieves the best performance, compared to SOTA methods in terms of OOD
detection and near OOD detection setting. The source code will be released at

*Naga Venkata Sai Jitin Jami,Thomas Altstidl,Jonas Mueller,Jindong Li,Dario Zanca,Bjoern Eskofier,Heike Leutheuser*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces two novel stratification methods (IPS and WDES) for creating representative dataset splits in image segmentation tasks, addressing biases from random splitting that lead to poor model generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random dataset splitting in image segmentation often creates unrepresentative test sets with biased evaluations and poor model generalization. Existing stratification methods for classification don't effectively handle the multi-label structure and class imbalance typical in segmentation data.

Method: Proposes Iterative Pixel Stratification (IPS) - a label-aware sampling method for segmentation, and Wasserstein-Driven Evolutionary Stratification (WDES) - a genetic algorithm that minimizes Wasserstein distance to optimize label distribution similarity across dataset splits.

Result: WDES consistently produces more representative splits than random sampling, leading to lower performance variance and improved model evaluation across diverse segmentation tasks (street scenes, medical imaging, satellite imagery). WDES is particularly valuable for small, imbalanced, and low-diversity datasets.

Conclusion: WDES is proven globally optimal and effectively addresses bias in dataset splitting for segmentation tasks, especially in challenging scenarios with limited or imbalanced data where conventional strategies are most prone to bias.

Abstract: Random splitting of datasets in image segmentation often leads to
unrepresentative test sets, resulting in biased evaluations and poor model
generalization. While stratified sampling has proven effective for addressing
label distribution imbalance in classification tasks, extending these ideas to
segmentation remains challenging due to the multi-label structure and class
imbalance typically present in such data. Building on existing stratification
concepts, we introduce Iterative Pixel Stratification (IPS), a straightforward,
label-aware sampling method tailored for segmentation tasks. Additionally, we
present Wasserstein-Driven Evolutionary Stratification (WDES), a novel genetic
algorithm designed to minimize the Wasserstein distance, thereby optimizing the
similarity of label distributions across dataset splits. We prove that WDES is
globally optimal given enough generations. Using newly proposed statistical
heterogeneity metrics, we evaluate both methods against random sampling and
find that WDES consistently produces more representative splits. Applying WDES
across diverse segmentation tasks, including street scenes, medical imaging,
and satellite imagery, leads to lower performance variance and improved model
evaluation. Our results also highlight the particular value of WDES in handling
small, imbalanced, and low-diversity datasets, where conventional splitting
strategies are most prone to bias.

*Riccardo La Grassa,Ignazio Gallo,Nicola Landro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EnGraf-Net uses semantic associations structured as a hierarchy (taxonomy) as supervised signals in an end-to-end deep neural network for fine-grained classification, achieving competitive performance without requiring cropping techniques or manual annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-grained classification models rely on part annotations or automatic cropping methods, which suffer from incomplete representation of local features. The authors propose that semantic associations in hierarchical structures can better capture the relationships needed to distinguish highly similar classes.

Method: EnGraf-Net is an end-to-end deep neural network that leverages semantic associations structured as a taxonomy hierarchy as supervised signals. It does not require part annotations, bounding boxes, or cropping techniques.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, CUB-200-2011, and FGVC-Aircraft datasets demonstrate EnGraf-Net's superiority over many existing fine-grained models and competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed EnGraf-Net effectively leverages semantic hierarchical associations for fine-grained classification, achieving strong performance without the need for manual annotations or complex cropping techniques, providing a more holistic approach to distinguishing similar objects.

Abstract: Fine-grained classification models are designed to focus on the relevant
details necessary to distinguish highly similar classes, particularly when
intra-class variance is high and inter-class variance is low. Most existing
models rely on part annotations such as bounding boxes, part locations, or
textual attributes to enhance classification performance, while others employ
sophisticated techniques to automatically extract attention maps. We posit that
part-based approaches, including automatic cropping methods, suffer from an
incomplete representation of local features, which are fundamental for
distinguishing similar objects. While fine-grained classification aims to
recognize the leaves of a hierarchical structure, humans recognize objects by
also forming semantic associations. In this paper, we leverage semantic
associations structured as a hierarchy (taxonomy) as supervised signals within
an end-to-end deep neural network model, termed EnGraf-Net. Extensive
experiments on three well-known datasets CIFAR-100, CUB-200-2011, and
FGVC-Aircraft demonstrate the superiority of EnGraf-Net over many existing
fine-grained models, showing competitive performance with the most recent
state-of-the-art approaches, without requiring cropping techniques or manual
annotations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Transformers (ViTs) remain vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks despite their robustness against other adversarial perturbations, with attack success rates varying significantly (40.04%-99.97%) across different ViT models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the transferability of adversarial attack techniques from CNNs to ViTs and assess ViT vulnerability to realistic adversarial patches using Creases Transformation technique.

Method: Designed realistic adversarial patches using Creases Transformation (CT) technique to cause misclassification in person vs. non-person classification tasks, evaluated across four fine-tuned ViT models on binary person classification.

Result: Attack success rates varied significantly: 40.04% (google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k), 99.97% (facebook/dino-vitb16), 66.40% (google/vit-base-patch16-224), and 65.17% (facebook/dinov3-vitb16).

Conclusion: Adversarial patches transfer effectively from CNNs to ViTs, with pre-training dataset scale and methodology strongly influencing model resilience to adversarial attacks.

Abstract: The increasing reliance on machine learning systems has made their security a
critical concern. Evasion attacks enable adversaries to manipulate the
decision-making processes of AI systems, potentially causing security breaches
or misclassification of targets. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained
significant traction in modern machine learning due to increased 1) performance
compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and 2) robustness against
adversarial perturbations. However, ViTs remain vulnerable to evasion attacks,
particularly to adversarial patches, unique patterns designed to manipulate AI
classification systems. These vulnerabilities are investigated by designing
realistic adversarial patches to cause misclassification in person vs.
non-person classification tasks using the Creases Transformation (CT)
technique, which adds subtle geometric distortions similar to those occurring
naturally when wearing clothing. This study investigates the transferability of
adversarial attack techniques used in CNNs when applied to ViT classification
models. Experimental evaluation across four fine-tuned ViT models on a binary
person classification task reveals significant vulnerability variations: attack
success rates ranged from 40.04% (google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) to 99.97%
(facebook/dino-vitb16), with google/vit-base-patch16-224 achieving 66.40% and
facebook/dinov3-vitb16 reaching 65.17%. These results confirm the
cross-architectural transferability of adversarial patches from CNNs to ViTs,
with pre-training dataset scale and methodology strongly influencing model
resilience to adversarial attacks.

TL;DR: UniTransfer is a novel architecture for video concept transfer that uses spatial and diffusion timestep decomposition with a progressive paradigm, achieving precise control over foreground, background, and motion components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve precise and controllable video concept transfer by decomposing videos into key components (foreground, background, motion) and leveraging progressive guidance mechanisms.

Method: Uses spatial decomposition into foreground subject, background, and motion flow; dual-to-single-stream DiT-based architecture; self-supervised pretraining with random masking; Chain-of-Prompt mechanism for timestep decomposition; and LLM-guided progressive generation.

Result: Extensive experiments show high-quality and controllable video concept transfer across diverse reference images and scenes, surpassing existing baselines in visual fidelity and editability.

Conclusion: UniTransfer effectively achieves precise video concept transfer through its decomposition approach and progressive guidance, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: We propose a novel architecture UniTransfer, which introduces both spatial
and diffusion timestep decomposition in a progressive paradigm, achieving
precise and controllable video concept transfer. Specifically, in terms of
spatial decomposition, we decouple videos into three key components: the
foreground subject, the background, and the motion flow. Building upon this
decomposed formulation, we further introduce a dual-to-single-stream DiT-based
architecture for supporting fine-grained control over different components in
the videos. We also introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on
random masking to enhance the decomposed representation learning from
large-scale unlabeled video data. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought reasoning
paradigm, we further revisit the denoising diffusion process and propose a
Chain-of-Prompt (CoP) mechanism to achieve the timestep decomposition. We
decompose the denoising process into three stages of different granularity and
leverage large language models (LLMs) for stage-specific instructions to guide
the generation progressively. We also curate an animal-centric video dataset
called OpenAnimal to facilitate the advancement and benchmarking of research in
video concept transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves high-quality and controllable video concept transfer across diverse
reference images and scenes, surpassing existing baselines in both visual
fidelity and editability. Web Page:

TL;DR: VTTS enhances multimodal LLM reasoning through iterative perception during inference, mimicking human hierarchical attention by progressively refining focus on high-confidence regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM methods are limited by static perception stages, failing to achieve human-level reasoning through dynamic visual analysis.

Method: VTTS uses Iterative Perception mechanism with reinforcement learning and spatio-temporal supervision, supported by VTTS-80K dataset for iterative perception training.

Result: Videochat-R1.5 model achieves average 5%+ improvement over strong baselines across 15+ benchmarks covering video conversation, reasoning, and spatio-temporal perception.

Conclusion: VTTS enables MLLMs to enhance performance by increasing perceptual compute through iterative perception, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Inducing reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is critical
for achieving human-level perception and understanding. Existing methods mainly
leverage LLM reasoning to analyze parsed visuals, often limited by static
perception stages. This paper introduces Visual Test-Time Scaling (VTTS), a
novel approach to enhance MLLMs' reasoning via iterative perception during
inference. VTTS mimics humans' hierarchical attention by progressively refining
focus on high-confidence spatio-temporal regions, guided by updated textual
predictions. Specifically, VTTS employs an Iterative Perception (ITP)
mechanism, incorporating reinforcement learning with spatio-temporal
supervision to optimize reasoning. To support this paradigm, we also present
VTTS-80K, a dataset tailored for iterative perception. These designs allows a
MLLM to enhance its performance by increasing its perceptual compute. Extensive
experiments validate VTTS's effectiveness and generalization across diverse
tasks and benchmarks. Our newly introduced Videochat-R1.5 model has achieved
remarkable improvements, with an average increase of over 5\%, compared to
robust baselines such as Qwen2.5VL-3B and -7B, across more than 15 benchmarks
that encompass video conversation, video reasoning, and spatio-temporal
perception.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mammo-CLIP Dissect is a concept-based explainability framework that uses a mammography-specific vision-language model to systematically analyze what deep learning models learn in mammography, revealing how training data and fine-tuning affect concept specialization and clinical relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding what DL models learn is crucial for safe AI deployment in clinical settings. Previous work focused on pixel-based explanations, but textual concepts may better reflect clinical reasoning used by radiologists.

Method: Leverages Mammo-CLIP (a mammography-specific vision-language model) as a "dissector" to label neurons with human-interpretable textual concepts and quantify their alignment with domain knowledge. Investigates concept learning differences between models trained on general vs. mammography data, effects of fine-tuning, and underrepresented concepts.

Result: Models trained on mammography data capture more clinically relevant concepts and align better with radiologists' workflows. Fine-tuning enhances capture of certain concepts (e.g., benign calcifications) but reduces coverage of others (e.g., density features), showing a trade-off between specialization and generalization.

Conclusion: Mammo-CLIP Dissect provides insights into how CNNs capture mammography-specific knowledge, revealing how domain-specific training and task adaptation shape concept learning. The framework helps understand model behavior for safer clinical AI deployment.

Abstract: Understanding what deep learning (DL) models learn is essential for the safe
deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical settings. While previous
work has focused on pixel-based explainability methods, less attention has been
paid to the textual concepts learned by these models, which may better reflect
the reasoning used by clinicians. We introduce Mammo-CLIP Dissect, the first
concept-based explainability framework for systematically dissecting DL vision
models trained for mammography. Leveraging a mammography-specific
vision-language model (Mammo-CLIP) as a "dissector," our approach labels
neurons at specified layers with human-interpretable textual concepts and
quantifies their alignment to domain knowledge. Using Mammo-CLIP Dissect, we
investigate three key questions: (1) how concept learning differs between DL
vision models trained on general image datasets versus mammography-specific
datasets; (2) how fine-tuning for downstream mammography tasks affects concept
specialisation; and (3) which mammography-relevant concepts remain
underrepresented. We show that models trained on mammography data capture more
clinically relevant concepts and align more closely with radiologists'
workflows than models not trained on mammography data. Fine-tuning for
task-specific classification enhances the capture of certain concept categories
(e.g., benign calcifications) but can reduce coverage of others (e.g.,
density-related features), indicating a trade-off between specialisation and
generalisation. Our findings show that Mammo-CLIP Dissect provides insights
into how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture mammography-specific
knowledge. By comparing models across training data and fine-tuning regimes, we
reveal how domain-specific training and task-specific adaptation shape concept
learning. Code and concept set are available:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs exhibit process inconsistency where intermediate reasoning drifts from video dynamics even when final answers are correct, undermining interpretability and robustness in video reasoning tasks.

Method: Introduces a reinforcement learning framework with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)-based process reward that aligns reasoning traces with temporally grounded references, enabling efficient process supervision without auxiliary reward models.

Result: MOSS-ChatV achieves 87.2% on MOSS-Video test split and improves performance on general video benchmarks (MVBench, MMVU). The framework shows consistent gains across different architectures (Qwen2.5-VL, Phi-2) and produces more consistent reasoning traces as judged by GPT-4o.

Conclusion: The DTW-based process reward framework effectively addresses process inconsistency in video reasoning, demonstrating broad applicability across different model architectures and producing more stable, interpretable reasoning traces.

Abstract: Video reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), requiring models to move beyond static perception
toward coherent understanding of temporal dynamics in complex scenes. Yet
existing MLLMs often exhibit process inconsistency, where intermediate
reasoning drifts from video dynamics even when the final answer is correct,
undermining interpretability and robustness. To address this issue, we
introduce MOSS-ChatV, a reinforcement learning framework with a Dynamic Time
Warping (DTW)-based process reward. This rule-based reward aligns reasoning
traces with temporally grounded references, enabling efficient process
supervision without auxiliary reward models. We further identify dynamic state
prediction as a key measure of video reasoning and construct MOSS-Video, a
benchmark with annotated reasoning traces, where the training split is used to
fine-tune MOSS-ChatV and the held-out split is reserved for evaluation.
MOSS-ChatV achieves 87.2\% on MOSS-Video (test) and improves performance on
general video benchmarks such as MVBench and MMVU. The framework consistently
yields gains across different architectures, including Qwen2.5-VL and Phi-2,
confirming its broad applicability. Evaluations with GPT-4o-as-judge further
show that MOSS-ChatV produces more consistent and stable reasoning traces.

TL;DR: A novel approach for video generation guided by camera trajectories that integrates both camera and object motions by converting them into pixel motion, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with consistency and generalizability when generating videos with both camera and object motions, often learning motions separately which causes confusion about relative motion between camera and objects.

Method: Proposes integrating camera and object motions by converting them into pixel motion, using stable diffusion to learn reference motion maps relative to camera trajectory, and combining with semantic object prior in an image-to-video network.

Result: Extensive experiments show the model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in generating videos that accurately follow designated camera trajectories while maintaining consistent object motions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses the challenge of generating consistent videos with both camera and object motions by unifying them through pixel motion representation, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Generating videos guided by camera trajectories poses significant challenges
in achieving consistency and generalizability, particularly when both camera
and object motions are present. Existing approaches often attempt to learn
these motions separately, which may lead to confusion regarding the relative
motion between the camera and the objects. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel approach that integrates both camera and object motions by
converting them into the motion of corresponding pixels. Utilizing a stable
diffusion network, we effectively learn reference motion maps in relation to
the specified camera trajectory. These maps, along with an extracted semantic
object prior, are then fed into an image-to-video network to generate the
desired video that can accurately follow the designated camera trajectory while
maintaining consistent object motions. Extensive experiments verify that our
model outperforms SOTA methods by a large margin.

TL;DR: Discriminators are most disadvantaged when dealing with datasets of either very low or very high complexity, while intermediate-complexity datasets favor detection of synthetic images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the conditions under which discriminators struggle most in distinguishing real from synthetic images, particularly examining the roles of data dimensionality and complexity.

Method: Analysis using Kolmogorov complexity as a measure of intrinsic dataset structure, examining how different levels of complexity affect the detectability of synthetic images.

Result: Both very simple and highly complex datasets reduce detectability of synthetic images, while intermediate-complexity datasets create optimal conditions for detection.

Conclusion: The effectiveness of discriminators depends critically on dataset complexity, with generators performing best at both extremes of the complexity spectrum.

Abstract: The rapid progress of image generative AI has blurred the boundary between
synthetic and real images, fueling an arms race between generators and
discriminators. This paper investigates the conditions under which
discriminators are most disadvantaged in this competition. We analyze two key
factors: data dimensionality and data complexity. While increased
dimensionality often strengthens the discriminators ability to detect subtle
inconsistencies, complexity introduces a more nuanced effect. Using Kolmogorov
complexity as a measure of intrinsic dataset structure, we show that both very
simple and highly complex datasets reduce the detectability of synthetic
images; generators can learn simple datasets almost perfectly, whereas extreme
diversity masks imperfections. In contrast, intermediate-complexity datasets
create the most favorable conditions for detection, as generators fail to fully
capture the distribution and their errors remain visible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable CLIP models to process images at multiple resolutions within a single model, allowing dynamic compute-accuracy trade-offs without requiring multiple specialized models.

Method: Replaces standard patch embeddings with multi-level wavelet decomposition, uses key-value caching and causal cross-level attention for computation reuse, and implements confidence-based gating for adaptive early exits.

Result: Achieves competitive accuracy with significant computational savings through lightweight distillation from a frozen CLIP teacher, enabling dynamic resolution selection.

Conclusion: WAVECLIP provides an efficient solution for adaptive resolution inference in vision-language models, offering practical deployment advantages through single-model multi-resolution capability.

Abstract: We introduce WAVECLIP, a single unified model for adaptive resolution
inference in CLIP, enabled by wavelet-based tokenization. WAVECLIP replaces
standard patch embeddings with a multi-level wavelet decomposition, enabling
the model to process images coarse to fine while naturally supporting multiple
resolutions within the same model. At inference time, the model begins with low
resolution tokens and refines only when needed, using key-value caching and
causal cross-level attention to reuse computation, effectively introducing to
the model only new information when needed. We evaluate WAVECLIP in zero-shot
classification, demonstrating that a simple confidence-based gating mechanism
enables adaptive early exits. This allows users to dynamically choose a
compute-accuracy trade-off using a single deployed model. Our approach requires
only lightweight distillation from a frozen CLIP teacher and achieves
competitive accuracy with significant computational savings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Quantization of CLIP models shows counterintuitive effects: it improves calibration for underconfident models but degrades it for overconfident ones, while still enhancing OOD detection. Specific QAT methods can simultaneously improve accuracy, calibration, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of quantization on CLIP models beyond just accuracy, focusing on reliability metrics like calibration and OOD detection, which are crucial for efficient and reliable deployment.

Method: Large-scale evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing in-distribution accuracy and comprehensive reliability metrics, including specific quantization-aware training (QAT) methods.

Result: Quantization consistently improves calibration for underconfident pre-trained models but degrades it for overconfident variants. However, OOD detection can still improve even with poor calibration. Some QAT methods yield simultaneous gains in accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness.

Conclusion: Quantization offers benefits beyond conventional efficiency-performance trade-offs, providing critical insights for deploying efficient, reliable, and robust vision-language models.

Abstract: The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models
(VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for
the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still
overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance
beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale
evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution
accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing
counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that
quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident
pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants.
Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other
reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these
same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific
quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in
zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a
strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights
for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable,
and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.

Motivation: Current VTU benchmarks use synthetic renderings lacking real-world complexity and visual diversity, and existing datasets offer fixed examples without access to underlying data for reformulation.

Method: Created TABLET dataset with 4 million examples from 2 million unique tables (88% preserving original visualizations), including paired image-HTML representations, metadata, and provenance information linking to source datasets.

Result: Fine-tuning vision-language models like Qwen2.5-VL-7B on TABLET improves performance on both seen and unseen VTU tasks while increasing robustness on real-world table visualizations.

Conclusion: TABLET establishes a foundation for robust training and extensible evaluation of future VTU models by preserving original visualizations and maintaining example traceability in a unified large-scale collection.

Abstract: While table understanding increasingly relies on pixel-only settings where
tables are processed as visual representations, current benchmarks
predominantly use synthetic renderings that lack the complexity and visual
diversity of real-world tables. Additionally, existing visual table
understanding (VTU) datasets offer fixed examples with single visualizations
and pre-defined instructions, providing no access to underlying serialized data
for reformulation. We introduce TABLET, a large-scale VTU dataset with 4
million examples across 20 tasks, grounded in 2 million unique tables where 88%
preserve original visualizations. Each example includes paired image-HTML
representations, comprehensive metadata, and provenance information linking
back to the source datasets. Fine-tuning vision-language models like
Qwen2.5-VL-7B on TABLET improves performance on seen and unseen VTU tasks while
increasing robustness on real-world table visualizations. By preserving
original visualizations and maintaining example traceability in a unified
large-scale collection, TABLET establishes a foundation for robust training and
extensible evaluation of future VTU models.

### [69] [Learning Conformal Explainers for Image Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21209)
*Amr Alkhatib,Stephanie Lowry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel conformal prediction-based approach for controlling the fidelity of feature attribution explanations in image-based predictions, which identifies salient feature subsets that preserve model predictions without needing ground-truth explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature attribution methods for image explanations often lack robustness and fail to faithfully reflect the underlying model's reasoning, requiring better fidelity control.

Method: Proposes four conformity functions to quantify explanation fidelity, identifies salient feature subsets that preserve predictions regardless of excluded features, and uses conformal prediction without ground-truth explanations for calibration.

Result: Empirical evaluation across five explainers and six image datasets shows FastSHAP consistently outperforms competing methods in fidelity and informational efficiency (explanation region size), with super-pixel conformity measures being more effective than pixel-wise ones.

Conclusion: The conformal prediction approach successfully enables direct control over explanation fidelity, with FastSHAP demonstrating superior performance and super-pixel measures proving more effective for quantifying explanation conformity.

Abstract: Feature attribution methods are widely used for explaining image-based
predictions, as they provide feature-level insights that can be intuitively
visualized. However, such explanations often vary in their robustness and may
fail to faithfully reflect the reasoning of the underlying black-box model. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel conformal prediction-based
approach that enables users to directly control the fidelity of the generated
explanations. The method identifies a subset of salient features that is
sufficient to preserve the model's prediction, regardless of the information
carried by the excluded features, and without demanding access to ground-truth
explanations for calibration. Four conformity functions are proposed to
quantify the extent to which explanations conform to the model's predictions.
The approach is empirically evaluated using five explainers across six image
datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that FastSHAP consistently
outperforms the competing methods in terms of both fidelity and informational
efficiency, the latter measured by the size of the explanation regions.
Furthermore, the results reveal that conformity measures based on super-pixels
are more effective than their pixel-wise counterparts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hunyuan3D-Omni is a unified framework for fine-grained, controllable 3D asset generation that accepts multiple input modalities beyond just images and text, enabling precise control over geometry, topology, and pose.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D generative models rely primarily on image or text conditioning and lack fine-grained cross-modal controls, which limits controllability and practical adoption in production workflows.

Method: Built on Hunyuan3D 2.1, the framework unifies point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal pose priors in a single cross-modal architecture. It uses progressive, difficulty-aware sampling that selects one control modality per example and biases toward harder signals while downweighting easier ones.

Result: Experiments show that the additional controls improve generation accuracy, enable geometry-aware transformations, and increase robustness for production workflows.

Conclusion: Hunyuan3D-Omni addresses the controllability gap in 3D asset generation by providing a unified framework that handles multiple input modalities and enables fine-grained control over 3D content creation.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D-native generative models have accelerated asset
creation for games, film, and design. However, most methods still rely
primarily on image or text conditioning and lack fine-grained, cross-modal
controls, which limits controllability and practical adoption. To address this
gap, we present Hunyuan3D-Omni, a unified framework for fine-grained,
controllable 3D asset generation built on Hunyuan3D 2.1. In addition to images,
Hunyuan3D-Omni accepts point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal pose
priors as conditioning signals, enabling precise control over geometry,
topology, and pose. Instead of separate heads for each modality, our model
unifies all signals in a single cross-modal architecture. We train with a
progressive, difficulty-aware sampling strategy that selects one control
modality per example and biases sampling toward harder signals (e.g., skeletal
pose) while downweighting easier ones (e.g., point clouds), encouraging robust
multi-modal fusion and graceful handling of missing inputs. Experiments show
that these additional controls improve generation accuracy, enable
geometry-aware transformations, and increase robustness for production
workflows.

### [71] [Sigma: Semantically Informative Pre-training for Skeleton-based Sign Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21223)
*Muxin Pu,Mei Kuan Lim,Chun Yong Chong,Chen Change Loy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sigma is a unified skeleton-based sign language understanding framework that addresses semantic grounding, local-global balance, and cross-modal learning challenges through sign-aware early fusion, hierarchical alignment, and unified pre-training, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple SLU tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current skeleton-based SLU methods face three key limitations: weak semantic grounding (models capture motion patterns but struggle with linguistic meaning), imbalance between local details and global context, and inefficient cross-modal learning for constructing semantically aligned representations.

Method: Proposes Sigma framework with: 1) sign-aware early fusion for deep visual-textual interaction, 2) hierarchical alignment learning to maximize agreements across modality features at different levels, and 3) unified pre-training combining contrastive learning, text matching, and language modeling for semantic consistency.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art results on isolated sign language recognition, continuous sign language recognition, and gloss-free sign language translation across multiple benchmarks spanning different sign and spoken languages.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the impact of semantically informative pre-training and the effectiveness of skeletal data as a stand-alone solution for SLU, showing that robust semantic understanding can be achieved through proper cross-modal alignment and hierarchical feature learning.

Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective for learning transferable features in sign
language understanding (SLU) tasks. Recently, skeleton-based methods have
gained increasing attention because they can robustly handle variations in
subjects and backgrounds without being affected by appearance or environmental
factors. Current SLU methods continue to face three key limitations: 1) weak
semantic grounding, as models often capture low-level motion patterns from
skeletal data but struggle to relate them to linguistic meaning; 2) imbalance
between local details and global context, with models either focusing too
narrowly on fine-grained cues or overlooking them for broader context; and 3)
inefficient cross-modal learning, as constructing semantically aligned
representations across modalities remains difficult. To address these, we
propose Sigma, a unified skeleton-based SLU framework featuring: 1) a
sign-aware early fusion mechanism that facilitates deep interaction between
visual and textual modalities, enriching visual features with linguistic
context; 2) a hierarchical alignment learning strategy that jointly maximises
agreements across different levels of paired features from different
modalities, effectively capturing both fine-grained details and high-level
semantic relationships; and 3) a unified pre-training framework that combines
contrastive learning, text matching and language modelling to promote semantic
consistency and generalisation. Sigma achieves new state-of-the-art results on
isolated sign language recognition, continuous sign language recognition, and
gloss-free sign language translation on multiple benchmarks spanning different
sign and spoken languages, demonstrating the impact of semantically informative
pre-training and the effectiveness of skeletal data as a stand-alone solution
for SLU.

*Ryan L. Yang,Dipkamal Bhusal,Nidhi Rastogi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework using vision-language models to automatically generate semantic attention maps via natural language prompts, reducing CNN reliance on superficial correlations without manual annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs often exploit superficial correlations instead of making predictions for the right reasons. Existing methods require labor-intensive expert annotations, limiting scalability.

Method: Leverage vision-language models to automatically generate semantic attention maps using natural language prompts. Introduce auxiliary loss to align CNN attention with language-guided maps.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ColoredMNIST and remains competitive with annotation-heavy baselines on DecoyMNIST. Shows improved generalization, reduced shortcut reliance, and attention maps that better reflect human intuition.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a scalable solution for promoting more reliable and cognitively plausible decision-making in CNNs without requiring manual annotation.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) frequently "cheat" by exploiting
superficial correlations, raising concerns about whether they make predictions
for the right reasons. Inspired by cognitive science, which highlights the role
of attention in robust human perception, recent methods have sought to guide
model attention using concept-based supervision and explanation regularization.
However, these techniques depend on labor-intensive, expert-provided
annotations, limiting their scalability. We propose a scalable framework that
leverages vision-language models to automatically generate semantic attention
maps using natural language prompts. By introducing an auxiliary loss that
aligns CNN attention with these language-guided maps, our approach promotes
more reliable and cognitively plausible decision-making without manual
annotation. Experiments on challenging datasets, ColoredMNIST and DecoyMNIST,
show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ColorMNIST and
remains competitive with annotation-heavy baselines on DecoyMNIST,
demonstrating improved generalization, reduced shortcut reliance, and model
attention that better reflects human intuition.

*Seyed Amir Kasaei,Ali Aghayari,Arash Marioriyad,Niki Sepasian,MohammadAmin Fazli,Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah,Mohammad Hossein Rohban*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A comprehensive study evaluating automated metrics for compositional text-image generation, showing that no single metric performs consistently across tasks and highlighting the importance of careful metric selection based on specific compositional challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-image generation evaluation relies heavily on automated metrics that are often adopted by convention rather than validated against human judgment, creating a critical need to understand how well these metrics reflect human preferences.

Method: Conducted a broad study examining widely used metrics across diverse compositional challenges, comparing different metric families' alignment with human judgments beyond simple correlation analysis.

Result: No single metric performs consistently across tasks - performance varies with compositional problem type. VQA-based metrics are not uniformly superior, while certain embedding-based metrics prove stronger in specific cases. Image-only metrics contribute little to compositional evaluation.

Conclusion: Careful and transparent metric selection is crucial for trustworthy evaluation and their use as reward models in generation, as metric performance depends heavily on the specific compositional challenge being evaluated.

Abstract: Text-image generation has advanced rapidly, but assessing whether outputs
truly capture the objects, attributes, and relations described in prompts
remains a central challenge. Evaluation in this space relies heavily on
automated metrics, yet these are often adopted by convention or popularity
rather than validated against human judgment. Because evaluation and reported
progress in the field depend directly on these metrics, it is critical to
understand how well they reflect human preferences. To address this, we present
a broad study of widely used metrics for compositional text-image evaluation.
Our analysis goes beyond simple correlation, examining their behavior across
diverse compositional challenges and comparing how different metric families
align with human judgments. The results show that no single metric performs
consistently across tasks: performance varies with the type of compositional
problem. Notably, VQA-based metrics, though popular, are not uniformly
superior, while certain embedding-based metrics prove stronger in specific
cases. Image-only metrics, as expected, contribute little to compositional
evaluation, as they are designed for perceptual quality rather than alignment.
These findings underscore the importance of careful and transparent metric
selection, both for trustworthy evaluation and for their use as reward models
in generation. Project page is available at

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a critical medical imaging modality in
clinical diagnosis and research, yet its complexity and heterogeneity pose
challenges for automated analysis, particularly in scalable and generalizable

integrates self-supervised vision learning with report-guided text supervision
to build robust, generalizable representations, enabling effective adaptation
across broad applications. To enable robust and diverse clinical tasks with
minimal computational overhead, Decipher-MR supports a modular design that
enables tuning of lightweight, task-specific decoders attached to a frozen
pretrained encoder. Following this setting, we evaluate Decipher-MR across
diverse benchmarks including disease classification, demographic prediction,
anatomical localization, and cross-modal retrieval, demonstrating consistent
performance gains over existing foundation models and task-specific approaches.

TL;DR: SlideMamba integrates Mamba architecture with Graph Neural Networks using entropy-based adaptive fusion for enhanced whole slide image analysis, outperforming existing methods in predicting gene fusion/mutation status.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a generalizable deep learning framework that captures both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies in Whole Slide Images for improved computational pathology analysis.

Method: Combines Mamba modules for long-range global dependencies with GNNs for short-range spatial interactions, using an entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism for adaptive fusion of complementary signals.

Result: Achieves PRAUC of 0.751 ± 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491), Trans-MIL (0.39), Mamba-only (0.664), GNN-only (0.748), and GAT-Mamba (0.703), with competitive ROC AUC (0.738), sensitivity (0.662), and specificity (0.725).

Conclusion: The integrated architecture with entropy-based adaptive fusion demonstrates strong performance and promising potential for spatially-resolved predictive modeling in computational pathology.

Abstract: Advances in computational pathology increasingly rely on extracting
meaningful representations from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to support various
clinical and biological tasks. In this study, we propose a generalizable deep
learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture
both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies,
offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules
excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize
fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these
complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an
entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically
balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the
branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the
contextual importance of local versus global information for different
downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a
representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our
framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve
(PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39
\pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a
prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves
competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm
0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength
of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive
fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of
spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based approaches struggle with multi-step reasoning in vision-language tasks due to inability to access fine-grained visual content and reliance on black-box models that are difficult to reproduce.

Method: Proposes SQ-InstructBLIP with three components sharing the same architecture: Questioner generates sub-questions, Answerer provides sub-answers, and Reasoner performs final reasoning using the generated sub-question information.

Result: Experiments show that SQ-InstructBLIP performs more accurate reasoning than previous works on VQA tasks by leveraging generated sub-questions as additional information.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses limitations of existing approaches by enabling image-aware multi-step reasoning through transparent, reproducible components.

Abstract: The field of vision-language understanding has been actively researched in
recent years, thanks to the development of Large Language Models~(LLMs).
However, it still needs help with problems requiring multi-step reasoning, even
for very simple questions. Recent studies adopt LLMs to tackle this problem by
iteratively generating sub-questions and answers. However, there are
disadvantages such as 1) the fine-grained visual contents of images are not
available using LLMs that cannot read visual information, 2) internal
mechanisms are inaccessible and difficult to reproduce by using black-box LLMs.
To solve these problems, we propose the SQ (Self-Questioning)-InstructBLIP,
which improves inference performance by generating image-aware informative
sub-questions and sub-answers iteratively. The SQ-InstructBLIP, which consists
of a Questioner, Answerer, and Reasoner that share the same architecture.
Questioner and Answerer generate sub-questions and sub-answers to help infer
the main-question, and Reasoner performs reasoning on the main-question
considering the generated sub-question information. Our experiments show that
the proposed method SQ-InstructBLIP, which uses the generated sub-questions as
additional information when solving the VQA task, performs more accurate
reasoning than the previous works.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution medical videos are crucial for accurate diagnosis but hard to acquire due to hardware limitations. Existing VSR models struggle with medical video challenges like camera shake, noise, and abrupt transitions, leading to optical flow errors and artifacts that can mislead doctors.

Method: Proposes MedVSR with two key components: Cross State-Space Propagation (CSSP) for precise alignment by projecting distant frames as control matrices, and Inner State-Space Reconstruction (ISSR) for enhancing tissue structures through joint long-range spatial feature learning and large-kernel short-range information aggregation.

Result: Experiments across four medical datasets (including endoscopy and cataract surgeries) show MedVSR significantly outperforms existing VSR models in both reconstruction performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: MedVSR provides an effective solution for medical video super-resolution, successfully addressing the unique challenges in medical imaging and demonstrating superior performance across diverse medical scenarios.

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) medical videos are vital for accurate diagnosis, yet are
hard to acquire due to hardware limitations and physiological constraints.
Clinically, the collected low-resolution (LR) medical videos present unique
challenges for video super-resolution (VSR) models, including camera shake,
noise, and abrupt frame transitions, which result in significant optical flow
errors and alignment difficulties. Additionally, tissues and organs exhibit
continuous and nuanced structures, but current VSR models are prone to
introducing artifacts and distorted features that can mislead doctors. To this
end, we propose MedVSR, a tailored framework for medical VSR. It first employs
Cross State-Space Propagation (CSSP) to address the imprecise alignment by
projecting distant frames as control matrices within state-space models,
enabling the selective propagation of consistent and informative features to
neighboring frames for effective alignment. Moreover, we design an Inner
State-Space Reconstruction (ISSR) module that enhances tissue structures and
reduces artifacts with joint long-range spatial feature learning and
large-kernel short-range information aggregation. Experiments across four
datasets in diverse medical scenarios, including endoscopy and cataract
surgeries, show that MedVSR significantly outperforms existing VSR models in
reconstruction performance and efficiency. Code released at

TL;DR: SHINE is a training-free framework for seamless image composition that leverages pretrained diffusion models to handle complex lighting and high-resolution inputs without latent inversion or attention surgery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image composition models struggle with complex lighting conditions (accurate shadows, water reflections) and diverse high-resolution inputs. While modern diffusion models encode essential physical and resolution priors, they lack a proper framework to utilize these capabilities without problematic techniques like latent inversion.

Method: SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss using pretrained customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject representation while preserving background integrity. It also employs degradation-suppression guidance and adaptive background blending to eliminate low-quality outputs and visible seams.

Result: Experiments on ComplexCompo (a new benchmark with diverse resolutions and challenging conditions) and DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward).

Conclusion: SHINE provides an effective training-free solution for high-fidelity image composition that outperforms existing methods, with the proposed ComplexCompo benchmark addressing the lack of rigorous evaluation standards in this domain.

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert a user-specified object into a
new scene, but existing models struggle with complex lighting (e.g., accurate
shadows, water reflections) and diverse, high-resolution inputs. Modern
text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX) already encode essential
physical and resolution priors, yet lack a framework to unleash them without
resorting to latent inversion, which often locks object poses into contextually
inappropriate orientations, or brittle attention surgery. We propose SHINE, a
training-free framework for Seamless, High-fidelity Insertion with Neutralized
Errors. SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss, leveraging pretrained
customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject
representation while preserving background integrity. Degradation-suppression
guidance and adaptive background blending are proposed to further eliminate
low-quality outputs and visible seams. To address the lack of rigorous
benchmarks, we introduce ComplexCompo, featuring diverse resolutions and
challenging conditions such as low lighting, strong illumination, intricate
shadows, and reflective surfaces. Experiments on ComplexCompo and
DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (e.g.,
DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (e.g., DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward).

Conclusion: SD3.5-Flash makes advanced generative AI truly accessible for practical deployment across the full spectrum of consumer devices.

Abstract: We present SD3.5-Flash, an efficient few-step distillation framework that
brings high-quality image generation to accessible consumer devices. Our
approach distills computationally prohibitive rectified flow models through a
reformulated distribution matching objective tailored specifically for few-step

gradient noise and "split-timestep fine-tuning" to improve prompt alignment.
Combined with comprehensive pipeline optimizations like text encoder
restructuring and specialized quantization, our system enables both rapid
generation and memory-efficient deployment across different hardware
configurations. This democratizes access across the full spectrum of devices,
from mobile phones to desktop computers. Through extensive evaluation including
large-scale user studies, we demonstrate that SD3.5-Flash consistently
outperforms existing few-step methods, making advanced generative AI truly

*Seyed Amir Kasaei,Mohammad Hossein Rohban*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new definition and taxonomy for hallucination in text-to-image models, categorizing it as bias-driven deviations into attribute, relation, and object hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of text-to-image models focus mainly on alignment with prompts but overlook what models generate beyond the prompt, failing to address bias-driven hallucinations that haven't been clearly framed in this domain.

Method: The authors propose a taxonomy with three categories of hallucination in text-to-image models: attribute hallucinations, relation hallucinations, and object hallucinations, establishing an upper bound for evaluation.

Result: This new framing surfaces hidden biases in text-to-image models and provides a foundation for richer assessment beyond simple prompt alignment checking.

Conclusion: The proposed taxonomy for hallucination in text-to-image generative models enables more comprehensive evaluation by addressing bias-driven deviations that current alignment-focused methods overlook.

Abstract: In language and vision-language models, hallucination is broadly understood
as content generated from a model's prior knowledge or biases rather than from
the given input. While this phenomenon has been studied in those domains, it
has not been clearly framed for text-to-image (T2I) generative models. Existing
evaluations mainly focus on alignment, checking whether prompt-specified
elements appear, but overlook what the model generates beyond the prompt. We
argue for defining hallucination in T2I as bias-driven deviations and propose a
taxonomy with three categories: attribute, relation, and object hallucinations.
This framing introduces an upper bound for evaluation and surfaces hidden
biases, providing a foundation for richer assessment of T2I models.

TL;DR: Proposed Person Independence Universal Micro-action Recognition Framework with Distributionally Robust Optimization to handle inter-person variability in micro-action recognition, achieving better generalization through temporal-frequency alignment and group-invariant regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing micro-action recognition methods fail in real-world scenarios due to inter-person variability causing the same action to manifest differently, which hinders robust generalization.

Method: Two plug-and-play components: 1) Temporal-Frequency Alignment Module with dual-branch design (temporal branch uses Wasserstein-regularized alignment, frequency branch uses variance-guided perturbations) and consistency-driven fusion; 2) Group-Invariant Regularized Loss that partitions samples into pseudo-groups and up-weights boundary cases to enhance robustness.

Result: Experiments on MA-52 dataset show the framework outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and robustness, achieving stable generalization under fine-grained conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses person-specific variations in micro-action recognition through distributionally robust optimization principles, enabling robust generalization in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Micro-action Recognition is vital for psychological assessment and
human-computer interaction. However, existing methods often fail in real-world
scenarios because inter-person variability causes the same action to manifest
differently, hindering robust generalization. To address this, we propose the
Person Independence Universal Micro-action Recognition Framework, which
integrates Distributionally Robust Optimization principles to learn
person-agnostic representations. Our framework contains two plug-and-play
components operating at the feature and loss levels. At the feature level, the
Temporal-Frequency Alignment Module normalizes person-specific motion
characteristics with a dual-branch design: the temporal branch applies
Wasserstein-regularized alignment to stabilize dynamic trajectories, while the
frequency branch introduces variance-guided perturbations to enhance robustness
against person-specific spectral differences. A consistency-driven fusion
mechanism integrates both branches. At the loss level, the Group-Invariant
Regularized Loss partitions samples into pseudo-groups to simulate unseen
person-specific distributions. By up-weighting boundary cases and regularizing
subgroup variance, it forces the model to generalize beyond easy or frequent
samples, thus enhancing robustness to difficult variations. Experiments on the
large-scale MA-52 dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing
methods in both accuracy and robustness, achieving stable generalization under
fine-grained conditions.

### [82] [Dense Semantic Matching with VGGT Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21263)
*Songlin Yang,Tianyi Wei,Yushi Lan,Zeqi Xiao,Anyi Rao,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel approach for semantic matching that addresses geometric ambiguity and nearest-neighbor limitations by adapting 3D geometric foundation model VGGT for cross-instance semantic matching through strategic fine-tuning and data-efficient training strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic matching approaches suffer from geometric ambiguity (failing to disambiguate symmetric structures) and limitations of nearest-neighbor rules (ignoring cross-image invisibility and manifold preservation), requiring geometry-aware descriptors and holistic correspondence mechanisms.

Method: The approach adapts VGGT for semantic matching by: (i) reusing early feature stages, fine-tuning later ones, and adding a semantic head for bidirectional correspondences; (ii) employing cycle-consistent training, synthetic data augmentation, and progressive training with aliasing artifact mitigation under data scarcity.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior geometry awareness, matching reliability, and manifold preservation compared to previous baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully adapts 3D geometric foundation models for semantic matching, overcoming key limitations of existing approaches and achieving state-of-the-art performance through strategic model adaptation and data-efficient training strategies.

Abstract: Semantic matching aims to establish pixel-level correspondences between
instances of the same category and represents a fundamental task in computer
vision. Existing approaches suffer from two limitations: (i) Geometric
Ambiguity: Their reliance on 2D foundation model features (e.g., Stable
Diffusion, DINO) often fails to disambiguate symmetric structures, requiring
extra fine-tuning yet lacking generalization; (ii) Nearest-Neighbor Rule: Their
pixel-wise matching ignores cross-image invisibility and neglects manifold
preservation. These challenges call for geometry-aware pixel descriptors and
holistic dense correspondence mechanisms. Inspired by recent advances in 3D
geometric foundation models, we turn to VGGT, which provides geometry-grounded
features and holistic dense matching capabilities well aligned with these
needs. However, directly transferring VGGT is challenging, as it was originally
designed for geometry matching within cross views of a single instance,
misaligned with cross-instance semantic matching, and further hindered by the
scarcity of dense semantic annotations. To address this, we propose an approach
that (i) retains VGGT's intrinsic strengths by reusing early feature stages,
fine-tuning later ones, and adding a semantic head for bidirectional
correspondences; and (ii) adapts VGGT to the semantic matching scenario under
data scarcity through cycle-consistent training strategy, synthetic data
augmentation, and progressive training recipe with aliasing artifact
mitigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior geometry awareness, matching reliability, and manifold preservation,
outperforming previous baselines.

### [83] [MMR1: Enhancing Multimodal Reasoning with Variance-Aware Sampling and Open Resources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21268)
*Sicong Leng,Jing Wang,Jiaxi Li,Hao Zhang,Zhiqiang Hu,Boqiang Zhang,Yuming Jiang,Hang Zhang,Xin Li,Lidong Bing,Deli Zhao,Wei Lu,Yu Rong,Aixin Sun,Shijian Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses limitations in multimodal reasoning models by proposing Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS) to stabilize RL fine-tuning, releasing large-scale curated datasets, and open-sourcing multimodal reasoning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal reasoning models face two major constraints: lack of open, large-scale high-quality chain-of-thought data and instability of reinforcement learning algorithms in post-training due to gradient vanishing when reward variance is low.

Method: Proposes Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS) with Variance Promotion Score (VPS) that combines outcome variance and trajectory diversity to promote reward variance. Also releases ~1.6M long CoT data and ~15k RL QA pairs with reproducible training codebase.

Result: Experiments across mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate effectiveness of both curated data and VAS. Theoretical analysis shows reward variance lower-bounds expected policy gradient magnitude.

Conclusion: The proposed VAS method effectively stabilizes policy optimization, and the released resources establish standardized baselines for the multimodal reasoning community.

Abstract: Large multimodal reasoning models have achieved rapid progress, but their
advancement is constrained by two major limitations: the absence of open,
large-scale, high-quality long chain-of-thought (CoT) data, and the instability
of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in post-training. Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), the standard framework for RL fine-tuning, is prone
to gradient vanishing when reward variance is low, which weakens optimization
signals and impairs convergence. This work makes three contributions: (1) We
propose Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS), a data selection strategy guided by
Variance Promotion Score (VPS) that combines outcome variance and trajectory
diversity to promote reward variance and stabilize policy optimization. (2) We
release large-scale, carefully curated resources containing ~1.6M long CoT
cold-start data and ~15k RL QA pairs, designed to ensure quality, difficulty,
and diversity, along with a fully reproducible end-to-end training codebase.
(3) We open-source a family of multimodal reasoning models in multiple scales,
establishing standardized baselines for the community. Experiments across
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both the
curated data and the proposed VAS. Comprehensive ablation studies and analyses
provide further insight into the contributions of each component. In addition,
we theoretically establish that reward variance lower-bounds the expected
policy gradient magnitude, with VAS serving as a practical mechanism to realize
this guarantee. Our code, data, and checkpoints are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a new foundation model using the Prithvi-EO Vision Transformer architecture, pre-trained on Sentinel-3 OLCI data for ocean science applications, demonstrating improved performance in chlorophyll concentration quantification and ocean primary production estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage AI foundation models for ocean science where labeled data is scarce and expensive, by utilizing massive unlabeled datasets to create more robust marine monitoring capabilities.

Method: Developed a foundation model using Prithvi-EO Vision Transformer architecture pre-trained on Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument data, then fine-tuned on downstream tasks including chlorophyll concentration quantification and ocean primary production estimation.

Result: The model demonstrated utility for marine monitoring, effectively using small amounts of high-quality labeled data while capturing detailed spatial patterns of ocean color and matching point observations.

Conclusion: This new generation of geospatial AI models has the potential to provide more robust, data-driven insights into ocean ecosystems and their role in global climate processes.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Foundation models (FMs), pre-trained on massive
unlabelled datasets, have the potential to drastically change AI applications
in ocean science, where labelled data are often sparse and expensive to
collect. In this work, we describe a new foundation model using the Prithvi-EO
Vision Transformer architecture which has been pre-trained to reconstruct data
from the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). We evaluate the
model by fine-tuning on two downstream marine earth observation tasks. We first
assess model performance compared to current baseline models used to quantify
chlorophyll concentration. We then evaluate the FMs ability to refine remote
sensing-based estimates of ocean primary production. Our results demonstrate
the utility of self-trained FMs for marine monitoring, in particular for making
use of small amounts of high quality labelled data and in capturing detailed
spatial patterns of ocean colour whilst matching point observations. We
conclude that this new generation of geospatial AI models has the potential to
provide more robust, data-driven insights into ocean ecosystems and their role
in global climate processes.

### [85] [Quantized Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21302)
*Weilun Feng,Haotong Qin,Mingqiang Wu,Chuanguang Yang,Yuqi Li,Xiangqi Li,Zhulin An,Libo Huang,Yulun Zhang,Michele Magno,Yongjun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuantVGGT is a novel quantization framework for Visual Geometry Grounded Transformers (VGGTs) that addresses challenges in compressing billion-scale 3D reconstruction models through dual-smoothed fine-grained quantization and noise-filtered diverse sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning-based 3D reconstruction models like VGGTs face prohibitive computational and memory costs that hinder real-world deployment. Traditional Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) struggles with VGGTs due to heavy-tailed activation distributions from data-independent special tokens and unstable calibration from multi-view 3D data.

Method: QuantVGGT introduces two key techniques: 1) Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained Quantization using pre-global Hadamard rotation and post-local channel smoothing to handle heavy-tailed distributions, and 2) Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling that filters outliers via deep-layer statistics and constructs frame-aware diverse calibration clusters.

Result: QuantVGGT achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks and bit-widths, with 4-bit quantization delivering 3.7× memory reduction and 2.5× acceleration while maintaining reconstruction accuracy above 98% of full-precision models.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates significant advantages for resource-constrained scenarios, making billion-scale VGGTs practically deployable with minimal accuracy loss while achieving substantial efficiency gains.

Abstract: Learning-based 3D reconstruction models, represented by Visual Geometry
Grounded Transformers (VGGTs), have made remarkable progress with the use of
large-scale transformers. Their prohibitive computational and memory costs
severely hinder real-world deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has
become a common practice for compressing and accelerating models. However, we
empirically observe that PTQ faces unique obstacles when compressing
billion-scale VGGTs: the data-independent special tokens induce heavy-tailed
activation distributions, while the multi-view nature of 3D data makes
calibration sample selection highly unstable. This paper proposes the first
Quantization framework for VGGTs, namely QuantVGGT. This mainly relies on two
technical contributions: First, we introduce Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained
Quantization, which integrates pre-global Hadamard rotation and post-local
channel smoothing to mitigate heavy-tailed distributions and inter-channel
variance robustly. Second, we design Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling, which
filters outliers via deep-layer statistics and constructs frame-aware diverse
calibration clusters to ensure stable quantization ranges. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that QuantVGGT achieves the state-of-the-art results
across different benchmarks and bit-width, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art generic quantization method with a great margin. We highlight
that our 4-bit QuantVGGT can deliver a 3.7$\times$ memory reduction and
2.5$\times$ acceleration in real-hardware inference, while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy above 98\% of its full-precision counterpart. This
demonstrates the vast advantages and practicality of QuantVGGT in
resource-constrained scenarios. Our code is released in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NewtonGen integrates data-driven synthesis with learnable physical principles to address physical inconsistency in text-to-video generation through Neural Newtonian Dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video models produce unrealistic motions and lack precise parameter control due to learning motion distributions solely from appearance without understanding underlying dynamics.

Method: Proposes NewtonGen framework with trainable Neural Newtonian Dynamics (NND) that models Newtonian motions and injects latent dynamical constraints into video generation.

Result: Enables physically consistent video synthesis with precise parameter control by jointly leveraging data priors and dynamical guidance.

Conclusion: Integration of learnable physical principles with data-driven synthesis addresses fundamental limitations in current text-to-video generation for improved physical consistency and controllability.

Abstract: A primary bottleneck in large-scale text-to-video generation today is
physical consistency and controllability. Despite recent advances,
state-of-the-art models often produce unrealistic motions, such as objects
falling upward, or abrupt changes in velocity and direction. Moreover, these
models lack precise parameter control, struggling to generate physically
consistent dynamics under different initial conditions. We argue that this
fundamental limitation stems from current models learning motion distributions
solely from appearance, while lacking an understanding of the underlying
dynamics. In this work, we propose NewtonGen, a framework that integrates
data-driven synthesis with learnable physical principles. At its core lies
trainable Neural Newtonian Dynamics (NND), which can model and predict a
variety of Newtonian motions, thereby injecting latent dynamical constraints
into the video generation process. By jointly leveraging data priors and
dynamical guidance, NewtonGen enables physically consistent video synthesis
with precise parameter control.

### [87] [An Approach to Checking Correctness for Agentic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20364)
*Thomas J Sheffler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A temporal expression language for monitoring AI agent behavior that detects errors in LLM-based agentic systems by analyzing execution traces and state transitions rather than text matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current error-detection methods relying on text matching are fragile due to natural language variability in LLM responses, necessitating a more robust approach focused on behavioral patterns.

Method: Uses temporal logic techniques from hardware verification to monitor agent tool calls and state transitions, providing assertions that capture correct behavioral patterns across execution scenarios.

Result: Demonstrated on a three-agent system where temporal assertions were satisfied with capable models but violated with smaller models due to improper tool sequencing and coordination failures.

Conclusion: The approach effectively detects behavioral regressions in production agentic systems and provides a foundation for systematic monitoring of AI agent reliability in critical applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a temporal expression language for monitoring AI agent
behavior, enabling systematic error-detection of LLM-based agentic systems that
exhibit variable outputs due to stochastic generation processes. Drawing from
temporal logic techniques used in hardware verification, this approach monitors
execution traces of agent tool calls and state transitions to detect deviations
from expected behavioral patterns. Current error-detection approaches rely
primarily on text matching of inputs and outputs, which proves fragile due to
the natural language variability inherent in LLM responses. The proposed method
instead focuses on the sequence of agent actions -- such as tool invocations
and inter-agent communications -- allowing verification of system behavior
independent of specific textual outputs. The temporal expression language
provides assertions that capture correct behavioral patterns across multiple
execution scenarios. These assertions serve dual purposes: validating prompt
engineering and guardrail effectiveness during development, and providing
regression testing when agents are updated with new LLMs or modified logic. The
approach is demonstrated using a three-agent system, where agents coordinate to
solve multi-step reasoning tasks. When powered by large, capable models, all
temporal assertions were satisfied across many test runs. However, when smaller
models were substituted in two of the three agents, executions violated
behavioral assertions, primarily due to improper tool sequencing and failed
coordination handoffs. The temporal expressions successfully flagged these
anomalies, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for detecting behavioral
regressions in production agentic systems. This approach provides a foundation
for systematic monitoring of AI agent reliability as these systems become
increasingly deployed in critical applications.

*Theo Uscidda,Matthew Trager,Michael Kleinman,Aditya Chattopadhyay,Wei Xia,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LATTS is a method that adaptively allocates computational resources during LLM generation by using a verifier model to determine when to resample, backtrack, restart, or stop based on local difficulty at each step.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing verifier-based methods for improving LLM performance increase computation uniformly across all samples and generation steps, leading to inefficient resource use without considering the complexity of individual instances.

Method: LATTS employs a verifier-based acceptance criterion at each generation step to decide whether to resample, backtrack, restart, or stop the generation process, adjusting computational effort based on local difficulty derived from the verifier model.

Result: Empirical results show that LATTS achieves significantly superior accuracy-compute tradeoffs compared to standard verifier-based methods.

Conclusion: LATTS provides an efficient approach to test-time scaling by adaptively allocating compute resources based on local difficulty, overcoming the limitations of uniform computation allocation in existing methods.

Abstract: One common strategy for improving the performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs) on downstream tasks involves using a \emph{verifier model} to either
select the best answer from a pool of candidates or to steer the
auto-regressive generation process towards better outputs. This class of
methods typically results in improved accuracy at the cost of increased
computation at test-time, a paradigm known as \emph{test-time scaling}.
However, most existing approaches increase computation uniformly across all
samples and generation steps, without considering the complexity of individual
instances, leading to inefficient resource use. We address this limitation by
proposing an approach, called \emph{Locally Adaptive Test-Time Scaling
(LATTS)}, that allocates variable compute across generation steps.
Specifically, at each generation step, LATTS employs a verifier-based
acceptance criterion to decide whether to resample, backtrack, restart, or stop
the generation process. This criterion effectively adjusts the per-step
computational effort based on a precise notion of \emph{local difficulty}
derived from the verifier model. Empirical results show that LATTS achieves
significantly superior accuracy--compute tradeoffs compared to standard
verifier-based methods.

TL;DR: A novel reconstruction framework for adaptive scheduling in time-triggered systems that dynamically validates and assembles schedules while ensuring safety constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in time-triggered systems including message collisions, locked loops from incorrect precedence handling, and generation of incomplete/invalid schedules that compromise system safety and performance.

Method: Systematic transformation of AI-generated or heuristic scheduling priorities into executable schedules with robust safety checks, efficient allocation algorithms, and recovery mechanisms for handling unexpected events like hardware failures and mode transitions.

Result: Significantly enhances system adaptability, operational integrity, and runtime performance while maintaining computational efficiency across multiple performance profiles including makespan minimization, workload balancing, and energy efficiency.

Conclusion: Provides a practical and scalable solution for safe schedule generation in safety-critical time-triggered systems, enabling reliable and flexible real-time scheduling under dynamic and uncertain operational conditions.

Abstract: Adaptive scheduling is crucial for ensuring the reliability and safety of
time-triggered systems (TTS) in dynamic operational environments. Scheduling
frameworks face significant challenges, including message collisions, locked
loops from incorrect precedence handling, and the generation of incomplete or
invalid schedules, which can compromise system safety and performance. To
address these challenges, this paper presents a novel reconstruction framework
designed to dynamically validate and assemble schedules. The proposed
reconstruction models operate by systematically transforming AI-generated or
heuristically derived scheduling priorities into fully executable schedules,
ensuring adherence to critical system constraints such as precedence rules and
collision-free communication. It incorporates robust safety checks, efficient
allocation algorithms, and recovery mechanisms to handle unexpected context
events, including hardware failures and mode transitions. Comprehensive
experiments were conducted across multiple performance profiles, including
makespan minimisation, workload balancing, and energy efficiency, to validate
the operational effectiveness of the reconstruction models. Results demonstrate
that the proposed framework significantly enhances system adaptability,
operational integrity, and runtime performance while maintaining computational
efficiency. Overall, this work contributes a practical and scalable solution to
the problem of safe schedule generation in safety-critical TTS, enabling
reliable and flexible real-time scheduling even under highly dynamic and

TL;DR: Proposes an adaptive online learning unit using Reinforcement Learning to overcome limitations of offline training for AI scheduling inferences in time-triggered architectures, enabling real-time adaptation to dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional offline training approaches struggle with constructing comprehensive Multi-Schedule Graphs that account for all possible scenarios like hardware failures and mode changes, making the process resource-intensive and infeasible for capturing the complete probability space.

Method: Integration of an adaptive online learning unit within the metascheduler that uses Reinforcement Learning models to continuously explore and discover new scheduling solutions, expanding the MSG and optimizing existing schedulers in real-time.

Result: The system becomes capable of handling unexpected events and complex scheduling scenarios more effectively, maintaining flexibility to meet evolving demands with stricter deadlines or new performance criteria.

Conclusion: The proposed approach ensures robustness and efficiency in large-scale, safety-critical environments by enabling dynamic adaptation through real-time training, overcoming the inherent limitations of offline-trained AI scheduling inferences.

Abstract: Metascheduling in time-triggered architectures has been crucial in adapting
to dynamic and unpredictable environments, ensuring the reliability and
efficiency of task execution. However, traditional approaches face significant
challenges when training Artificial Intelligence (AI) scheduling inferences
offline, particularly due to the complexities involved in constructing a
comprehensive Multi-Schedule Graph (MSG) that accounts for all possible
scenarios. The process of generating an MSG that captures the vast probability
space, especially when considering context events like hardware failures, slack
variations, or mode changes, is resource-intensive and often infeasible. To
address these challenges, we propose an adaptive online learning unit
integrated within the metascheduler to enhance performance in real-time. The
primary motivation for developing this unit stems from the limitations of
offline training, where the MSG created is inherently a subset of the complete
space, focusing only on the most probable and critical context events. In the
online mode, Reinforcement Learning (RL) plays a pivotal role by continuously
exploring and discovering new scheduling solutions, thus expanding the MSG and
enhancing system performance over time. This dynamic adaptation allows the
system to handle unexpected events and complex scheduling scenarios more
effectively. Several RL models were implemented within the online learning
unit, each designed to address specific challenges in scheduling. These models
not only facilitate the discovery of new solutions but also optimize existing
schedulers, particularly when stricter deadlines or new performance criteria
are introduced. By continuously refining the AI inferences through real-time
training, the system remains flexible and capable of meeting evolving demands,
thus ensuring robustness and efficiency in large-scale, safety-critical
environments.

*Pawel Trajdos,Marek Kurzynski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A fuzzy recognition system for EMG-based hand prosthesis control that detects contaminated biosignals using one-class classifiers and KNN ensembles to improve classification quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EMG biosignals for prosthetic control are highly susceptible to contamination, which significantly reduces classification quality and makes it difficult to achieve acceptable recognition performance.

Method: Developed a two-ensemble system: one-class classifiers to detect contamination in individual EMG channels, and KNN classifiers for intent recognition. Used a coherent fuzzy model with uniform soft decision scheme throughout the recognition process.

Result: Experimental evaluation using real biosignals from a public repository showed comparative analysis of method parameters and procedures affecting recognition quality. The system was compared with similar literature systems.

Conclusion: The proposed fuzzy recognition system with contamination detection effectively mitigates adverse effects of biosignal contamination, improving the quality of EMG-based prosthetic control systems.

Abstract: Modern anthropomorphic upper limb bioprostheses are typically controlled by
electromyographic (EMG) biosignals using a pattern recognition scheme.
Unfortunately, there are many factors originating from the human source of
objects to be classified and from the human-prosthesis interface that make it
difficult to obtain an acceptable classification quality. One of these factors
is the high susceptibility of biosignals to contamination, which can
considerably reduce the quality of classification of a recognition system.
  In the paper, the authors propose a new recognition system intended for EMG
based control of the hand prosthesis with detection of contaminated biosignals
in order to mitigate the adverse effect of contaminations. The system consists
of two ensembles: the set of one-class classifiers (OCC) to assess the degree
of contamination of individual channels and the ensemble of K-nearest
neighbours (KNN) classifier to recognise the patient's intent. For all
recognition systems, an original, coherent fuzzy model was developed, which
allows the use of a uniform soft (fuzzy) decision scheme throughout the
recognition process. The experimental evaluation was conducted using real
biosignals from a public repository. The goal was to provide an experimental
comparative analysis of the parameters and procedures of the developed method
on which the quality of the recognition system depends. The proposed fuzzy
recognition system was also compared with similar systems described in the
literature.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAMULE is a self-learning framework for LLM agents that uses multi-level reflection synthesis to generate high-quality reflections from failures across single trajectories, intra-task comparisons, and inter-task insights, significantly outperforming existing reflection-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents struggle with generating meaningful reflections due to inadequate error analysis and reliance on rare successful trajectories, especially in complex tasks.

Method: Proposes SAMULE framework with three-level reflection synthesis: Single-Trajectory Learning (micro-level) for detailed error correction, Intra-Task Learning (meso-level) for error taxonomies across multiple trials, and Inter-Task Learning (macro-level) for transferable insights from diverse task failures. Fine-tunes a retrospective language model and extends to interactive settings with foresight-based reflection.

Result: Extensive experiments on TravelPlanner, NATURAL PLAN, and Tau-bench show SAMULE significantly outperforms reflection-based baselines.

Conclusion: Well-designed reflection synthesis and failure-centric learning are critical for building self-improving LLM agents.

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in LLM agents, they still face the challenge
of generating meaningful reflections due to inadequate error analysis and a
reliance on rare successful trajectories, especially in complex tasks. In this
work, we propose SAMULE, a new framework for self-learning agents powered by a
retrospective language model that is trained based on Multi-Level Reflection
Synthesis. It first synthesizes high-quality reflections across three
complementary levels: Single-Trajectory Learning (micro-level) for detailed
error correction; Intra-Task Learning (meso-level) to build error taxonomies
across multiple trials of the same task, and Inter-Task Learning (macro-level)
to extract transferable insights based on same typed errors from diverse task
failures. Then we fine-tune a language model serving as the retrospective model
to generate reflections during inference. We further extend our framework to
interactive settings through a foresight-based reflection mechanism, enabling
agents to proactively reflect and adapt during user interactions by comparing
predicted and actual responses. Extensive experiments on three challenging
benchmarks - TravelPlanner, NATURAL PLAN, and Tau-bench - demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms reflection-based baselines. Our results
highlight the critical role of well-designed reflection synthesis and
failure-centric learning in building self-improving LLM agents.

Conclusion: The architecture provides an intelligent and scalable blueprint for safeguarding complex digital infrastructure, compatible with zero-trust models and supporting adherence to international cybersecurity regulations.

Abstract: Traditional static cybersecurity models often struggle with scalability,
real-time detection, and contextual responsiveness in the current digital
product ecosystems which include cloud services, application programming
interfaces (APIs), mobile platforms, and edge devices. This study introduces
autonomous goal driven agents capable of dynamic learning and context-aware
decision making as part of an adaptive cybersecurity architecture driven by
agentic artificial intelligence (AI). To facilitate autonomous threat
mitigation, proactive policy enforcement, and real-time anomaly detection, this
framework integrates agentic AI across the key ecosystem layers. Behavioral
baselining, decentralized risk scoring, and federated threat intelligence
sharing are important features. The capacity of the system to identify zero-day
attacks and dynamically modify access policies was demonstrated through native
cloud simulations. The evaluation results show increased adaptability,
decreased response latency, and improved detection accuracy. The architecture
provides an intelligent and scalable blueprint for safeguarding complex digital
infrastructure and is compatible with zero-trust models, thereby supporting the
adherence to international cybersecurity regulations.

Motivation: Product claims are critical for consumer purchase behavior but require substantial time and funding to create. The paper aims to disrupt the speed and economics of claim creation processes.

Method: Developed Claim Advisor web application using in-context learning and fine-tuning of large language models. The system has three functions: semantic search for existing claims/visuals, claim generation/optimization based on product description and consumer profile, and claim ranking using synthetic consumer simulations.

Result: Applications in a consumer packaged goods company showed very promising results, demonstrating the system's effectiveness in accelerating claim creation processes.

Conclusion: The capability is broadly useful across product categories and industries. The authors share their learning to encourage research and application of generative AI in different industries.

Abstract: The benefit claims of a product is a critical driver of consumers' purchase
behavior. Creating product claims is an intense task that requires substantial
time and funding. We have developed the $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ web
application to accelerate claim creations using in-context learning and
fine-tuning of large language models (LLM). $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ was
designed to disrupt the speed and economics of claim search, generation,
optimization, and simulation. It has three functions: (1) semantically
searching and identifying existing claims and/or visuals that resonate with the
voice of consumers; (2) generating and/or optimizing claims based on a product
description and a consumer profile; and (3) ranking generated and/or manually
created claims using simulations via synthetic consumers. Applications in a
consumer packaged goods (CPG) company have shown very promising results. We
believe that this capability is broadly useful and applicable across product
categories and industries. We share our learning to encourage the research and
application of generative AI in different industries.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Developed a RAG system using LLaMA-4 109B for automated radiotherapy treatment plan evaluation that integrates retrieval, percentile prediction, and constraint checking with LLM-driven reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an automated, protocol-aware, and interpretable system for radiotherapy treatment plan evaluation that combines structured population-based scoring with transparent reasoning.

Method: Used a multi-protocol dataset of 614 radiotherapy plans across four disease sites. Built a RAG system with three core modules: retrieval engine (optimized across five SentenceTransformer backbones), percentile prediction based on cohort similarity, and clinical constraint checker, all directed by an LLM using multi-step prompt-driven reasoning.

Result: Achieved perfect nearest-neighbor accuracy within 5-percentile-point margin and sub-2pt MAE. End-to-end testing showed 100% agreement with standalone modules on percentile estimates and constraint identification, confirming reliable execution of all steps.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates feasibility of combining structured population-based scoring with modular tool-augmented reasoning for transparent, scalable plan evaluation in radiation therapy, offering traceable outputs and minimizing hallucination.

Abstract: Purpose: To develop a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system powered by
LLaMA-4 109B for automated, protocol-aware, and interpretable evaluation of
radiotherapy treatment plans.
  Methods and Materials: We curated a multi-protocol dataset of 614
radiotherapy plans across four disease sites and constructed a knowledge base
containing normalized dose metrics and protocol-defined constraints. The RAG
system integrates three core modules: a retrieval engine optimized across five
SentenceTransformer backbones, a percentile prediction component based on
cohort similarity, and a clinical constraint checker. These tools are directed
by a large language model (LLM) using a multi-step prompt-driven reasoning
pipeline to produce concise, grounded evaluations.
  Results: Retrieval hyperparameters were optimized using Gaussian Process on a
scalarized loss function combining root mean squared error (RMSE), mean
absolute error (MAE), and clinically motivated accuracy thresholds. The best
configuration, based on all-MiniLM-L6-v2, achieved perfect nearest-neighbor
accuracy within a 5-percentile-point margin and a sub-2pt MAE. When tested
end-to-end, the RAG system achieved 100% agreement with the computed values by
standalone retrieval and constraint-checking modules on both percentile
estimates and constraint identification, confirming reliable execution of all
retrieval, prediction and checking steps.
  Conclusion: Our findings highlight the feasibility of combining structured
population-based scoring with modular tool-augmented reasoning for transparent,
scalable plan evaluation in radiation therapy. The system offers traceable
outputs, minimizes hallucination, and demonstrates robustness across protocols.
Future directions include clinician-led validation, and improved domain-adapted
retrieval models to enhance real-world integration.

*Jiazheng Sun,Te Yang,Jiayang Niu,Mingxuan Li,Yongyong Lu,Ruimeng Yang,Xin Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Fairy is an interactive multi-agent mobile assistant that addresses limitations of existing GUI agents by enabling cross-app collaboration, interactive execution, and continual learning through three core modules: Global Task Planner, App-Level Executor, and Self-Learner.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large multi-modal models struggle with real-world mobile GUI scenarios involving diverse app interfaces and evolving user needs. End-to-end methods fail on long-tail apps, and agents without user interaction act unilaterally, harming user experience.

Method: Fairy uses three core modules: (i) Global Task Planner decomposes user tasks into sub-tasks from cross-app view; (ii) App-Level Executor refines sub-tasks into steps and actions using long- and short-term memory with four core agents in dual loops; (iii) Self-Learner consolidates execution experience into App Map and Tricks.

Result: Fairy with GPT-4o backbone outperforms previous state-of-the-art by improving user requirement completion by 33.7% and reducing redundant steps by 58.5% on the RealMobile-Eval benchmark.

Conclusion: Fairy demonstrates the effectiveness of interactive multi-agent systems with self-learning capabilities for mobile GUI tasks, showing significant improvements in task completion and efficiency through its interaction and learning mechanisms.

Abstract: Large multi-modal models (LMMs) have advanced mobile GUI agents. However,
existing methods struggle with real-world scenarios involving diverse app
interfaces and evolving user needs. End-to-end methods relying on model's
commonsense often fail on long-tail apps, and agents without user interaction
act unilaterally, harming user experience. To address these limitations, we
propose Fairy, an interactive multi-agent mobile assistant capable of
continuously accumulating app knowledge and self-evolving during usage. Fairy
enables cross-app collaboration, interactive execution, and continual learning
through three core modules:(i) a Global Task Planner that decomposes user tasks
into sub-tasks from a cross-app view; (ii) an App-Level Executor that refines
sub-tasks into steps and actions based on long- and short-term memory,
achieving precise execution and user interaction via four core agents operating
in dual loops; and (iii) a Self-Learner that consolidates execution experience
into App Map and Tricks. To evaluate Fairy, we introduce RealMobile-Eval, a
real-world benchmark with a comprehensive metric suite, and LMM-based agents
for automated scoring. Experiments show that Fairy with GPT-4o backbone
outperforms the previous SoTA by improving user requirement completion by 33.7%
and reducing redundant steps by 58.5%, showing the effectiveness of its
interaction and self-learning.

### [99] [Parallel Thinking, Sequential Answering: Bridging NAR and AR for Efficient Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20744)
*Qihang Ai,Haiyun Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new framework combining auto-regressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) models for reasoning tasks, where NAR generates intermediate reasoning traces efficiently and AR produces precise final answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR models are slow for reasoning tasks requiring long chains of thought, while NAR models are fast but produce lower quality outputs. This work aims to leverage the strengths of both.

Method: Integration of AR and NAR models where NAR efficiently generates intermediate reasoning traces that guide an AR model to produce final answers.

Result: 26% improvement over strong baselines with substantially reduced inference cost.

Conclusion: The hybrid AR-NAR approach effectively balances speed and quality for reasoning tasks.

Abstract: We study reasoning tasks through a framework that integrates auto-regressive
(AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) language models. AR models, which generate
text sequentially, excel at producing coherent outputs but often suffer from
slow inference, particularly in reasoning-intensive domains such as mathematics
and code, where lengthy chains of thought are required. In contrast, NAR
models, such as discrete diffusion models, allow parallel generation and offer
substantial speedups, though typically at the cost of reduced output quality.
To address these limitations, we introduce a new paradigm in which an NAR model
efficiently produces intermediate reasoning traces, which subsequently guide an
AR model to deliver precise final answers. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach yields significant 26% improvements over strong baselines while
substantially reducing inference cost.

### [100] [Meta-Memory: Retrieving and Integrating Semantic-Spatial Memories for Robot Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20754)
*Yufan Mao,Hanjing Ye,Wenlong Dong,Chengjie Zhang,Hong Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Meta-Memory is an LLM-driven agent that constructs high-density memory representations for robots, enabling efficient retrieval and integration of memories through joint semantic-spatial reasoning to answer natural language location queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots need effective memory systems to store observations and leverage them for spatial reasoning, but current approaches lack principled mechanisms for efficient memory retrieval and integration.

Method: Proposes Meta-Memory, which constructs high-density memory representations and performs joint reasoning over semantic and spatial modalities to retrieve and integrate relevant memories for answering location queries.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both the proposed SpaceLocQA dataset and public NaVQA benchmark, with successful deployment on real-world robotic platforms.

Conclusion: Meta-Memory provides robust and accurate spatial reasoning capabilities for robots in complex environments, demonstrating practical utility through real-world deployment.

Abstract: Navigating complex environments requires robots to effectively store
observations as memories and leverage them to answer human queries about
spatial locations, which is a critical yet underexplored research challenge.
While prior work has made progress in constructing robotic memory, few have
addressed the principled mechanisms needed for efficient memory retrieval and
integration. To bridge this gap, we propose Meta-Memory, a large language model
(LLM)-driven agent that constructs a high-density memory representation of the
environment. The key innovation of Meta-Memory lies in its capacity to retrieve
and integrate relevant memories through joint reasoning over semantic and
spatial modalities in response to natural language location queries, thereby
empowering robots with robust and accurate spatial reasoning capabilities. To
evaluate its performance, we introduce SpaceLocQA, a large-scale dataset
encompassing diverse real-world spatial question-answering scenarios.
Experimental results show that Meta-Memory significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on both the SpaceLocQA and the public NaVQA
benchmarks. Furthermore, we successfully deployed Meta-Memory on real-world
robotic platforms, demonstrating its practical utility in complex environments.

*Lipeng Ma,Yixuan Li,Weidong Yang,Mingjie Zhou,Xinyi Liu,Ben Fei,Shuhao Li,Xiaoyan Sun,Sihang Jiang,Yanghua Xiao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LogReasoner is a coarse-to-fine reasoning enhancement framework that enables LLMs to perform expert-level log analysis by structuring reasoning workflows and refining analytical granularity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose LLMs struggle with structured reasoning workflows that align with expert cognition in log analysis tasks, lacking precision in reasoning steps for system monitoring and failure diagnosis.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) coarse-grained enhancement using expert troubleshooting flowcharts to structure reasoning workflows, (2) fine-grained enhancement through task-specific fine-tuning and preference learning to calibrate reasoning details from mistakes.

Result: LogReasoner significantly outperforms existing LLMs on four distinct log analysis tasks using Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances LLMs' reasoning capabilities for log analysis, demonstrating improved analytical granularity and correctness compared to general-purpose LLMs.

Abstract: Log analysis is crucial for monitoring system health and diagnosing failures
in complex systems. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for automated log analysis, leveraging their reasoning
capabilities to perform tasks such as anomaly detection and failure prediction.
However, general-purpose LLMs struggle to formulate structured reasoning
workflows that align with expert cognition and deliver precise details of
reasoning steps. To address these challenges, we propose LogReasoner, a
coarse-to-fine reasoning enhancement framework designed to enable LLMs to
reason log analysis tasks like experts. LogReasoner consists of two stages: (1)
coarse-grained enhancement of expert thinking, where high-level expert thoughts
are constructed from collected troubleshooting flowcharts and existing tasks to
enable LLMs to formulate structured reasoning workflows and (2) fine-grained
enhancement of specific steps, where we first fine-tune the LLM with
task-specific stepwise solutions to enhance the LLM for instantiated reasoning,
then employ the preference learning to calibrate the LLM's reasoning details
from its mistakes, further strengthen the LLM's analytical granularity and
correctness. We evaluate LogReasoner on four distinct log analysis tasks using
open-source LLMs such as Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3. Experimental results show that
LogReasoner significantly outperforms existing LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art
performance and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs for log analysis.

*Tianrun Xu,Haoda Jing,Ye Li,Yuquan Wei,Jun Feng,Guanyu Chen,Haichuan Gao,Tianren Zhang,Feng Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeFacto is a counterfactual reasoning framework that improves multimodal language models by enforcing both accurate answering and faithful reasoning through three complementary training paradigms and GRPO-based reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal language models often arrive at correct answers by relying on irrelevant or spurious regions due to prior knowledge or dataset biases, indicating flawed reasoning and lack of true image understanding despite correct answers.

Method: Proposes DeFacto framework with three training paradigms (positive, counterfactual, random-masking) using automatically localized question-relevant evidence. Trains models with GRPO-based reinforcement learning using three complementary rewards for accurate answering and evidence-grounded reasoning.

Result: Experiments on diverse benchmarks show DeFacto substantially improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, establishing a stronger foundation for interpretable multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: DeFacto successfully addresses reasoning fidelity issues in multimodal tasks by jointly enforcing accurate answering and faithful reasoning through counterfactual training and reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal language models (MLLMs) have achieved
remarkable progress in vision-language reasoning, especially with the emergence
of "thinking with images," which integrates explicit visual steps into the
reasoning process. While this paradigm strengthens image-based reasoning, a
significant challenge remains: models may arrive at correct answers by relying
on irrelevant or spurious regions, driven by prior knowledge or dataset biases.
Even when the answer is correct, flawed reasoning indicates that the model has
not truly understood the image, highlighting the critical importance of
reasoning fidelity in multimodal tasks. To address this issue, we propose
DeFacto, a counterfactual reasoning framework that jointly enforces accurate
answering and faithful reasoning. A key component of our approach is the design
of three complementary training paradigms: (i) positive, (ii) counterfactual,
and (iii) random-masking. To enable these paradigms, we develop a pipeline that
automatically localizes question-relevant evidence and constructs positive,
counterfactual, and random variants, resulting in a dataset of about 100k
images. Building on this framework, we train multimodal language models with
GRPO-based reinforcement learning, where we design three complementary rewards
to guide the model toward accurate answering and evidence-grounded reasoning.
Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that DeFacto substantially
improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, establishing a
stronger foundation for interpretable multimodal reasoning. The code is
available on GitHub and the dataset is released on HuggingFace.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GALAX integrates GNNs with LLMs via reinforcement learning using a Graph Process Reward Model to enable explainable subgraph reasoning for precision medicine target discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches in precision medicine have limitations: numerical omics ignore topological context, LLMs lack quantitative reasoning, and graph models underuse node semantics. Process Reward Models face issues with unreliable intermediate evaluation and reward hacking.

Method: Proposes GALAX framework that combines pretrained GNNs with LLMs using reinforcement learning guided by a Graph Process Reward Model (GPRM). The method generates disease-relevant subgraphs step-wise, initiated by LLM and iteratively evaluated by GNN.

Result: Developed Target-QA benchmark combining CRISPR targets, multi-omic profiles, and biomedical graph knowledge across cancer cell lines. Enables GNN pretraining for supervising graph construction and supports long-context reasoning over text-numeric graphs.

Conclusion: GALAX provides a scalable, biologically grounded framework for explainable, reinforcement-guided subgraph reasoning, enabling reliable and interpretable target and pathway discovery in precision medicine.

Abstract: In precision medicine, quantitative multi-omic features, topological context,
and textual biological knowledge play vital roles in identifying
disease-critical signaling pathways and targets. Existing pipelines capture
only part of these-numerical omics ignore topological context, text-centric
LLMs lack quantitative grounded reasoning, and graph-only models underuse node
semantics and the generalization of LLMs-limiting mechanistic interpretability.
Although Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to guide reasoning in LLMs, they
remain limited by unreliable intermediate evaluation, and vulnerability to
reward hacking with computational cost. These gaps motivate integrating
quantitative multi-omic signals, topological structure with node annotations,
and literature-scale text via LLMs, using subgraph reasoning as the principle
bridge linking numeric evidence, topological knowledge and language context.
Therefore, we propose GALAX (Graph Augmented LAnguage model with
eXplainability), an innovative framework that integrates pretrained Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) into Large Language Models (LLMs) via reinforcement
guided by a Graph Process Reward Model (GPRM), which generates disease-relevant
subgraphs in a step-wise manner initiated by an LLM and iteratively evaluated
by a pretrained GNN, enabling process-level supervision without explicit
intermediate reasoning annotations. As an application, we also introduced
Target-QA, a benchmark combining CRISPR-identified targets, multi-omic
profiles, and biomedical graph knowledge across diverse cancer cell lines,
which enables GNN pretraining for supervising step-wise graph construction and
supports long-context reasoning over text-numeric graphs (TNGs), providing a
scalable and biologically grounded framework for explainable,
reinforcement-guided subgraph reasoning toward reliable and interpretable
target and pathway discovery in precision medicine.

TL;DR: An LLM-based framework for mobile app review analysis that overcomes limitations of traditional star-rating systems by extracting nuanced feedback from review texts using structured prompting and retrieval-augmented QA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional star-rating systems fail to capture nuanced feedback in detailed review texts, and conventional NLP methods struggle with contextual nuances, domain-specific terminology, and subtle linguistic features like sarcasm.

Method: A modular framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) enhanced by structured prompting techniques, which quantifies rating-text sentiment discrepancies, extracts feature-level insights, and supports interactive exploration through retrieval-augmented conversational question answering (RAG-QA).

Result: Comprehensive experiments on three diverse datasets (AWARE, Google Play, and Spotify) demonstrate that the LLM-driven approach significantly surpasses baseline methods in accuracy, robustness, and actionable insights for challenging review scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM-based framework provides superior performance over traditional methods for mobile app review analysis, offering improved capability to handle context-rich review scenarios and extract meaningful insights from textual feedback.

Abstract: We present an advanced approach to mobile app review analysis aimed at
addressing limitations inherent in traditional star-rating systems. Star
ratings, although intuitive and popular among users, often fail to capture the
nuanced feedback present in detailed review texts. Traditional NLP techniques
-- such as lexicon-based methods and classical machine learning classifiers --
struggle to interpret contextual nuances, domain-specific terminology, and
subtle linguistic features like sarcasm. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a modular framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) enhanced by
structured prompting techniques. Our method quantifies discrepancies between
numerical ratings and textual sentiment, extracts detailed, feature-level
insights, and supports interactive exploration of reviews through
retrieval-augmented conversational question answering (RAG-QA). Comprehensive
experiments conducted on three diverse datasets (AWARE, Google Play, and
Spotify) demonstrate that our LLM-driven approach significantly surpasses
baseline methods, yielding improved accuracy, robustness, and actionable
insights in challenging and context-rich review scenarios.

TL;DR: AOT* is a framework that integrates LLM-generated chemical synthesis pathways with AND-OR tree search to improve retrosynthesis planning efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-step retrosynthetic planning faces computational challenges due to exponential search spaces and high inference costs, despite LLMs showing chemical reasoning capabilities.

Method: AOT* atomically maps LLM-generated synthesis routes onto AND-OR tree components with mathematically sound reward assignment and retrieval-based context engineering, enabling efficient navigation in chemical space.

Result: AOT* achieves state-of-the-art performance with 3-5× fewer iterations than existing LLM-based approaches, with efficiency advantages becoming more pronounced on complex molecular targets.

Conclusion: The framework successfully transforms retrosynthetic planning by combining LLM capabilities with systematic search, demonstrating significant efficiency improvements while maintaining competitive solve rates.

Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning enables the discovery of viable synthetic routes for
target molecules, playing a crucial role in domains like drug discovery and
materials design. Multi-step retrosynthetic planning remains computationally
challenging due to exponential search spaces and inference costs. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate chemical reasoning capabilities, their
application to synthesis planning faces constraints on efficiency and cost. To
address these challenges, we introduce AOT*, a framework that transforms
retrosynthetic planning by integrating LLM-generated chemical synthesis
pathways with systematic AND-OR tree search. To this end, AOT* atomically maps
the generated complete synthesis routes onto AND-OR tree components, with a
mathematically sound design of reward assignment strategy and retrieval-based
context engineering, thus enabling LLMs to efficiently navigate in the chemical
space. Experimental evaluation on multiple synthesis benchmarks demonstrates
that AOT* achieves SOTA performance with significantly improved search
efficiency. AOT* exhibits competitive solve rates using 3-5$\times$ fewer
iterations than existing LLM-based approaches, with the efficiency advantage
becoming more pronounced on complex molecular targets.

TL;DR: A framework using deterministic finite automata (DFAs) to evaluate AI agents' function-call sequences with comprehensive metrics beyond binary final-state assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agent benchmarks only evaluate final outcomes, ignoring critical aspects like safety, efficiency, and intermediate correctness in real-world task execution.

Method: Proposes a DFA-based framework that encodes tasks as valid tool-use paths and introduces CORE metrics suite (Path Correctness, Kendall's tau Composite, Prefix Criticality, Harmful-Call Rate, Efficiency) for principled agent assessment.

Result: The method reveals significant performance differences between agents across diverse world models that traditional final-state evaluation would miss, showing agents that appear equivalent under simple metrics actually differ substantially.

Conclusion: The DFA-based framework with CORE metrics provides a more comprehensive and principled approach to evaluating AI agents' real-world task execution, capturing safety, efficiency, and intermediate correctness aspects that traditional methods overlook.

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents that solve real-world tasks through function-call
sequences remains an open challenge. Existing agentic benchmarks often reduce
evaluation to a binary judgment of the final state, overlooking critical
aspects such as safety, efficiency, and intermediate correctness. We propose a
framework based on deterministic finite automata (DFAs) that encodes tasks as
sets of valid tool-use paths, enabling principled assessment of agent behavior
in diverse world models. Building on this foundation, we introduce CORE, a
suite of five metrics, namely Path Correctness, Path Correctness - Kendall's
tau Composite, Prefix Criticality, Harmful-Call Rate, and Efficiency, that
quantify alignment with expected execution patterns. Across diverse worlds, our
method reveals important performance differences between agents that would
otherwise appear equivalent under traditional final-state evaluation schemes.

*Miao Li,Alexander Gurung,Irina Saparina,Mirella Lapata*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SciTrek is a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs' long-context reasoning using scientific articles, featuring complex questions requiring information synthesis across multiple full-text papers, with automated generation via SQL queries for verifiable reasoning steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current long-context benchmarks use non-scientific texts, focus on simple retrieval tasks, or employ artificial contexts, failing to adequately test complex reasoning capabilities needed for scientific literature analysis.

Method: Questions and answers are automatically generated by formulating them as SQL queries over a database of article metadata. This provides explicit, verifiable reasoning steps and scales to contexts up to 1M tokens with minimal supervision.

Result: Experiments show SciTrek poses significant challenges as context length increases, with fine-tuning and reinforcement learning offering limited gains. Models struggle with basic numerical operations and locating specific information in long contexts.

Conclusion: SciTrek reveals systematic shortcomings in LLMs' long-context reasoning abilities, particularly for scientific literature analysis, highlighting the need for improved methods to handle complex information synthesis across lengthy documents.

Abstract: This paper introduces SciTrek, a novel question-answering benchmark designed
to evaluate the long-context reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) using scientific articles. Current long-context benchmarks often rely on
non-scientific texts, focus on simple information retrieval tasks, or employ
artificial contexts. SciTrek addresses these limitations by proposing complex
questions that require information aggregation and synthesis across multiple
full-text scientific articles. Questions and their ground-truth answers are
automatically generated by formulating them as SQL queries over a database
constructed from article metadata (titles, authors, and references). The SQL
operations provide explicit, verifiable reasoning steps for fine-grained error
analysis, and the construction process scales to contexts up to 1M tokens with
minimal supervision. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of open-weight and
proprietary LLMs demonstrate that SciTrek poses a significant challenge as the
context length increases, with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning offering only limited gains. Our analysis reveals systematic
shortcomings in models' abilities to perform basic numerical operations and
accurately locate specific information in long contexts.

### [108] [CLAUSE: Agentic Neuro-Symbolic Knowledge Graph Reasoning via Dynamic Learnable Context Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21035)
*Yang Zhao,Chengxiao Dai,Wei Zhuo,Yue Xiu,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CLAUSE is a neuro-symbolic framework that optimizes multi-hop question answering by treating context construction as a sequential decision process, balancing accuracy, latency, and cost through three coordinated agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods like static k-hop expansions and "think-longer" prompting often over-retrieve context, inflate costs, and have unpredictable runtime. There's a need for systems that can balance answer accuracy with strict latency and cost targets while preserving provenance.

Method: CLAUSE uses a three-agent neuro-symbolic framework with Lagrangian-Constrained Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LC-MAPPO) to coordinate Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, and Context Curator agents. These agents jointly optimize subgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection under user-specified resource budgets.

Result: Across HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG, CLAUSE achieves higher EM@1 while reducing subgraph growth and latency at equal or lower token budgets. On MetaQA-2-hop, it achieves +39.3 EM@1 with 18.6% lower latency and 40.9% lower edge growth compared to GraphRAG.

Conclusion: CLAUSE provides compact, provenance-preserving contexts with predictable performance under deployment constraints, effectively balancing accuracy, latency, and cost trade-offs without requiring retraining.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs provide structured context for multi-hop question answering,
but deployed systems must balance answer accuracy with strict latency and cost
targets while preserving provenance. Static k-hop expansions and "think-longer"
prompting often over-retrieve, inflate context, and yield unpredictable
runtime. We introduce CLAUSE, an agentic three-agent neuro-symbolic framework
that treats context construction as a sequential decision process over
knowledge graphs, deciding what to expand, which paths to follow or backtrack,
what evidence to keep, and when to stop. Latency (interaction steps) and prompt
cost (selected tokens) are exposed as user-specified budgets or prices,
allowing per-query adaptation to trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost
without retraining. CLAUSE employs the proposed Lagrangian-Constrained
Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LC-MAPPO) algorithm to coordinate
three agents: Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, and Context Curator, so that
subgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection are
jointly optimized under per-query resource budgets on edge edits, interaction
steps, and selected tokens. Across HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG, CLAUSE yields
higher EM@1 while reducing subgraph growth and end-to-end latency at equal or
lower token budgets. On MetaQA-2-hop, relative to the strongest RAG baseline

edge growth. The resulting contexts are compact, provenance-preserving, and
deliver predictable performance under deployment constraints.

*Samuel Schapiro,Sumuk Shashidhar,Alexi Gladstone,Jonah Black,Royce Moon,Dilek Hakkani-Tur,Lav R. Varshney*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for evaluating combinatorial creativity in LLMs, focusing on novelty and utility rather than accuracy, and reveals scaling behaviors, optimal model architectures, and a persistent novelty-utility tradeoff.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks fail to address the open-ended nature of combinatorial creativity in LLMs used for scientific idea generation, necessitating new evaluation methods beyond traditional accuracy metrics.

Method: Proposed a theoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating creativity by degrees of novelty and utility, then conducted empirical analysis of scaling behavior, model architecture optimization, and the novelty-utility tradeoff.

Result: Found optimal model depths/widths for creativity at fixed compute budgets, identified an ideation-execution gap explained by a fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff that persists even at scale.

Conclusion: The persistent novelty-utility tradeoff casts doubt on LLMs' long-term creative potential in current form, while providing a foundation for understanding and improving creativity in AI models.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and large language models (LLMs) in
particular, are increasingly employed for creative tasks like scientific idea
generation, constituting a form of generalization from training data
unaddressed by existing conceptual frameworks. Though in many ways similar to
forms of compositional generalization (CG), combinatorial creativity (CC) is an
open-ended ability. Instead of evaluating for accuracy or correctness against
fixed targets, which would contradict the open-ended nature of CC, we propose a
theoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating outputs by their
degrees of novelty and utility. From here, we make several important empirical
contributions: (1) We obtain the first insights into the scaling behavior of
creativity for LLMs. (2) We discover that, for fixed compute budgets, there
exist optimal model depths and widths for creative ability. (3) We find that
the ideation-execution gap, whereby LLMs excel at generating novel scientific
ideas but struggle to ensure their practical feasibility, may be explained by a
more fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff characteristic of creativity
algorithms in general. Importantly, this tradeoff remains persistent even at
scale, casting doubt on the long-term creative potential of LLMs in their
current form. Together, our conceptual framework and empirical findings provide
a foundation for understanding and improving creativity in modern AI models,
marking a new frontier in generalization abilities.

### [110] [Disagreements in Reasoning: How a Model's Thinking Process Dictates Persuasion in Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21054)
*Haodong Zhao,Jidong Li,Zhaomin Wu,Tianjie Ju,Zhuosheng Zhang,Bingsheng He,Gongshen Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper challenges the hypothesis that persuasive efficacy in Multi-Agent Systems is primarily determined by model scale, proposing instead that cognitive processes and reasoning capacity are fundamental. It identifies a Persuasion Duality where reasoning models are more resistant to persuasion but become more persuasive when their reasoning is transparent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand persuasion dynamics in Multi-Agent Systems where LLMs and LRMs collaborate, challenging the prevailing scale-based hypothesis and exploring how internal cognitive processes affect persuasive behavior.

Method: Conducted multi-agent persuasion experiments examining how reasoning capacity affects persuasion resistance and efficacy, including analysis of reasoning transparency and multi-hop persuasion in agent networks.

Result: Found that LRMs with explicit reasoning are more resistant to persuasion but become dramatically more persuasive when their reasoning process is transparent. Complex transmission dynamics show influence propagation and decay in multi-hop persuasion networks.

Conclusion: A model's internal processing architecture directly influences its external persuasive behavior, providing critical insights for the safety, robustness, and design of future Multi-Agent Systems.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of recent Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), where Large
Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) usually collaborate to
solve complex problems, necessitates a deep understanding of the persuasion
dynamics that govern their interactions. This paper challenges the prevailing
hypothesis that persuasive efficacy is primarily a function of model scale. We
propose instead that these dynamics are fundamentally dictated by a model's
underlying cognitive process, especially its capacity for explicit reasoning.
Through a series of multi-agent persuasion experiments, we uncover a
fundamental trade-off we term the Persuasion Duality. Our findings reveal that
the reasoning process in LRMs exhibits significantly greater resistance to
persuasion, maintaining their initial beliefs more robustly. Conversely, making
this reasoning process transparent by sharing the "thinking content"
dramatically increases their ability to persuade others. We further consider
more complex transmission persuasion situations and reveal complex dynamics of
influence propagation and decay within multi-hop persuasion between multiple
agent networks. This research provides systematic evidence linking a model's
internal processing architecture to its external persuasive behavior, offering
a novel explanation for the susceptibility of advanced models and highlighting
critical implications for the safety, robustness, and design of future MAS.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Recon-Act is a self-evolving multi-agent framework that improves web task automation by using a reconnaissance-action paradigm to generate generalized tools from error analysis, enabling better performance on long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal agents struggle with disordered action sequencing and excessive trial-and-error when solving multi-turn, long-horizon tasks on real-world webpages, limiting their practical effectiveness.

Method: A two-team system: Reconnaissance Team conducts comparative error analysis and generates generalized tools (hints or code), while Action Team handles intent decomposition, tool orchestration, and execution, creating a closed-loop data-tools-action-feedback pipeline.

Result: Recon-Act achieves state-of-the-art performance on VisualWebArena, substantially improving adaptability to unseen websites and solvability on long-horizon tasks, currently reaching Level 3 implementation with limited human intervention.

Conclusion: The reconnaissance-action behavioral paradigm with self-evolving tool generation enables more effective web automation, particularly for complex, multi-turn tasks, representing significant progress in intelligent browser agent development.

Abstract: Recent years, multimodal models have made remarkable strides and pave the way
for intelligent browser use agents. However, when solving tasks on real world
webpages in multi-turn, long-horizon trajectories, current agents still suffer
from disordered action sequencing and excessive trial and error during
execution. This paper introduces Recon-Act, a self-evolving multi-agent
framework grounded in Reconnaissance-Action behavioral paradigm. The system
comprises a Reconnaissance Team and an Action Team: the former conducts
comparative analysis and tool generation, while the latter handles intent
decomposition, tool orchestration, and execution. By contrasting the erroneous
trajectories with successful ones, the Reconnaissance Team infers remedies, and
abstracts them into a unified notion of generalized tools, either expressed as
hints or as rule-based codes, and register to the tool archive in real time.
The Action Team reinference the process empowered with these targeting tools,
thus establishing a closed-loop training pipeline of
data-tools-action-feedback. Following the 6 level implementation roadmap
proposed in this work, we have currently reached Level 3 (with limited
human-in-the-loop intervention). Leveraging generalized tools obtained through
reconnaissance, Recon-Act substantially improves adaptability to unseen
websites and solvability on long-horizon tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging VisualWebArena dataset.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TrustJudge is a probabilistic framework that addresses inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge evaluation systems by introducing distribution-sensitive scoring and likelihood-aware aggregation to resolve score-comparison and pairwise transitivity inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-as-a-judge evaluation frameworks suffer from critical inconsistencies including score-comparison inconsistency (where lower-rated responses outperform higher-scored ones) and pairwise transitivity inconsistency (circular preference chains and equivalence contradictions), which stem from information loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments.

Method: TrustJudge uses two key innovations: 1) distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from discrete rating probabilities to preserve information entropy, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity.

Result: When evaluated with Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct, TrustJudge reduces Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining higher evaluation accuracy across various model architectures and scales.

Conclusion: TrustJudge provides the first systematic analysis of evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment without requiring additional training or human annotations.

Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated evaluators
(LLM-as-a-judge) has revealed critical inconsistencies in current evaluation
frameworks. We identify two fundamental types of inconsistencies: (1)
Score-Comparison Inconsistency, where lower-rated responses outperform
higher-scored ones in pairwise comparisons, and (2) Pairwise Transitivity
Inconsistency, manifested through circular preference chains (A>B>C>A) and
equivalence contradictions (A=B=C\neq A). We argue that these issues come from
information loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments during
pairwise evaluation. We propose TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that
addresses these limitations through two key innovations: 1)
distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from
discrete rating probabilities, preserving information entropy for more precise
scoring, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity
violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity. We also
formalize the theoretical limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and
demonstrate how TrustJudge's components overcome them. When evaluated with
Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge using our dataset, TrustJudge reduces
Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise
Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining
higher evaluation accuracy. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of
evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both
theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment.
The framework demonstrates consistent improvements across various model
architectures and scales, enabling more trustworthy LLM evaluation without
requiring additional training or human annotations. The codes can be found at

### [113] [Expanding Reasoning Potential in Foundation Model by Learning Diverse Chains of Thought Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21124)
*Xuemiao Zhang,Can Ren,Chengying Tu,Rongxiang Weng,Shuo Wang,Hongfei Yan,Jingang Wang,Xunliang Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to enhance mathematical reasoning in large models by selectively using high-value chain-of-thought (CoT) data based on reasoning patterns, achieving significant performance improvements with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches use CoT data indiscriminately, lacking understanding of which data types most effectively improve reasoning capabilities. The paper aims to identify and utilize high-value reasoning patterns to expand model reasoning potential.

Method: The authors define reasoning potential as the inverse of attempts needed to answer correctly. They abstract atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, create a core reference set, and use a dual-granularity algorithm (chains of reasoning patterns and token entropy) to select high-value CoT data (CoTP) that aligns with the core set.

Result: Using only 10B-token CoTP data, the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts model improved by 9.58% on AIME 2024 and 2025, and raised the upper bound of downstream RL performance by 7.81%.

Conclusion: Selective use of high-value reasoning patterns in CoT data significantly enhances mathematical reasoning capabilities in large models, demonstrating efficient data utilization and improved performance.

Abstract: Recent progress in large reasoning models for challenging mathematical
reasoning has been driven by reinforcement learning (RL). Incorporating long
chain-of-thought (CoT) data during mid-training has also been shown to
substantially improve reasoning depth. However, current approaches often
utilize CoT data indiscriminately, leaving open the critical question of which
data types most effectively enhance model reasoning capabilities. In this
paper, we define the foundation model's reasoning potential for the first time
as the inverse of the number of independent attempts required to correctly
answer the question, which is strongly correlated with the final model
performance. We then propose utilizing diverse data enriched with high-value
reasoning patterns to expand the reasoning potential. Specifically, we abstract
atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, characterized by commonality and
inductive capabilities, and use them to construct a core reference set enriched
with valuable reasoning patterns. Furthermore, we propose a dual-granularity
algorithm involving chains of reasoning patterns and token entropy, efficiently
selecting high-value CoT data (CoTP) from the data pool that aligns with the
core set, thereby training models to master reasoning effectively. Only
10B-token CoTP data enables the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model to improve
by 9.58% on the challenging AIME 2024 and 2025, and to raise the upper bound of
downstream RL performance by 7.81%.

*Kohsei Matsutani,Shota Takashiro,Gouki Minegishi,Takeshi Kojima,Yusuke Iwasawa,Yutaka Matsuo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework to analyze how RL and SFT training methods shape LLM reasoning processes, revealing complementary effects: RL compresses incorrect reasoning paths while SFT expands correct ones, explaining why SFT followed by RL is effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) actually shape reasoning capabilities in LLMs, going beyond simple accuracy metrics to analyze qualitative changes in reasoning paths.

Method: Developed a two-level analysis framework: trajectory-level (complete reasoning outputs) and step-level (reasoning graphs with individual steps as nodes). Applied this to 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameter models on mathematical reasoning tasks.

Result: RL compresses incorrect reasoning trajectories while SFT expands correct ones. RL steepens decay rates of graph metrics (2.5x), concentrating reasoning into few steps, while SFT flattens them (reduced to 1/3), distributing reasoning across more steps.

Conclusion: The complementary effects of RL and SFT explain why SFT followed by RL training is effective. RL focuses reasoning while SFT generalizes it, offering insights for more efficient data construction and learning approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained by reinforcement learning
(RL) with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
reasoning traces to improve their reasoning abilities. However, how these
methods shape reasoning capabilities remains largely elusive. Going beyond an
accuracy-based investigation of how these two components sculpt the reasoning
process, this paper introduces a novel analysis framework that quantifies
reasoning paths and captures their qualitative changes under each training
process (with models of 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters on mathematical domains).
Specifically, we investigate the reasoning process at two levels of
granularity: the trajectory-level, which examines complete reasoning outputs,
and the step-level, which analyzes reasoning graphs whose nodes correspond to
individual reasoning steps. Notably, clustering of unique reasoning
trajectories shows complementary effects: RL compresses incorrect trajectories,
whereas SFT expands correct ones. Step-level analysis reveals that RL steepens
(about 2.5 times), while SFT flattens (reduced to about one-third), the decay
rates of node visitation frequency, degree, and betweenness centrality
distributions in the reasoning graph. This indicates that RL concentrates
reasoning functionality into a small subset of steps, while SFT homogenizes it
across many steps. Furthermore, by evaluating the reasoning graph topologies
from multiple perspectives, we delineate the shared and distinct
characteristics of RL and SFT. Our work presents a novel reasoning path
perspective that explains why the current best practice of two-stage training,
with SFT followed by RL, is successful, and offers practical implications for
data construction and more efficient learning approaches.

*Yiwen Zhang,Ziang Chen,Fanqi Kong,Yizhe Huang,Xue Feng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ToMPO algorithm enhances LLM strategic decision-making by modeling others' strategies and optimizing multi-level rewards, outperforming GRPO by 35% and larger models by 18%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM decision-making methods focus on social conversations but neglect strategic decision interdependence and opponent strategy modeling in complex scenarios.

Method: Proposed ToMPO algorithm with: 1) strategy-aware rollouts, 2) graph-level and sample-level advantage estimation, 3) global-partial reward balancing to optimize Theory of Mind reasoning.

Result: ToMPO outperforms GRPO by 35% in compliance and cooperation, and shows 18% improvement over models 100x larger in strategic decision-making capabilities.

Conclusion: ToMPO effectively enhances LLM strategic decision-making through Theory of Mind optimization, demonstrating significant improvements in complex interdependent decision scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used to make decisions in complex
scenarios, where they need models to think deeply, reason logically, and decide
wisely. Many existing studies focus solely on multi-round conversations in
social tasks or simulated environments, neglecting the various types of
decisions and their interdependence. Current reinforcement learning methods
struggle to consider the strategies of others during training. To address these
issues, we first define a strategic decision-making problem that includes two
types of decisions and their temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we propose
**T**heory **o**f **M**ind **P**olicy **O**ptimization **(ToMPO)** algorithm to
optimize the perception of other individual strategies and the game situation
trends. Compared to the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm,
ToMPO enhances the LLM's strategic decision-making mainly by: 1) generating
rollouts based on reasoning the strategies of other individuals, 2) estimating
advantages at both the graph-level and sample-level, and 3) balancing global
and partial rewards. The ToMPO algorithm outperforms the GRPO method by 35% in
terms of model output compliance and cooperative outcomes. Additionally, when
compared to models with parameter sizes 100 times larger, it shows an 18%
improvement. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the ToMPO algorithm in
enhancing the model's strategic decision-making capabilities.

TL;DR: A unified approach inspired by mirror neurons that aligns representations between observed and executed actions using contrastive learning in a shared latent space, improving both action understanding and execution tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine learning methods treat action understanding and embodied execution as separate tasks, overlooking the fundamental interplay between them that mirror neurons reveal.

Method: Use two linear layers to map representations to a shared latent space where contrastive learning aligns corresponding observed and executed action representations by maximizing their mutual information.

Result: The approach fosters mutual synergy between the two tasks, effectively improving representation quality and generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: Explicitly aligning representations of observed and executed actions, inspired by mirror neuron mechanisms, provides a unified perspective that enhances both action understanding and execution performance.

Abstract: Mirror neurons are a class of neurons that activate both when an individual
observes an action and when they perform the same action. This mechanism
reveals a fundamental interplay between action understanding and embodied
execution, suggesting that these two abilities are inherently connected.
Nonetheless, existing machine learning methods largely overlook this interplay,
treating these abilities as separate tasks. In this study, we provide a unified
perspective in modeling them through the lens of representation learning. We
first observe that their intermediate representations spontaneously align.
Inspired by mirror neurons, we further introduce an approach that explicitly
aligns the representations of observed and executed actions. Specifically, we
employ two linear layers to map the representations to a shared latent space,
where contrastive learning enforces the alignment of corresponding
representations, effectively maximizing their mutual information. Experiments
demonstrate that this simple approach fosters mutual synergy between the two
tasks, effectively improving representation quality and generalization.

TL;DR: LLMs process rare tokens through distributed specialization - coordinated but spatially distributed subnetworks that emerge via parameter differentiation rather than discrete modular architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with representing and generating rare tokens, which are important in specialized domains. The paper investigates whether LLMs develop internal specialization mechanisms through discrete modular architectures or distributed parameter-level differentiation.

Method: Systematic analysis of final-layer MLP neurons across multiple model families, examining influence hierarchy, activation patterns, and training dynamics to understand rare-token processing mechanisms.

Result: Discovered three organizational principles: reproducible three-regime influence hierarchy (plateau neurons, power-law decay neurons, minimal neurons), coordinated activation patterns with reduced effective dimensionality, and universal accessibility through standard attention pathways. Training shows gradual emergence through parameter differentiation with heavy-tailed weight correlation spectra.

Conclusion: LLMs process rare tokens through distributed coordination within shared architectures rather than mixture-of-experts-style modularity, providing insights for interpretable model editing, computational efficiency optimization, and understanding emergent functional organization in transformers.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with representing and generating rare
tokens despite their importance in specialized domains. We investigate whether
LLMs develop internal specialization mechanisms through discrete modular
architectures or distributed parameter-level differentiation. Through
systematic analysis of final-layer MLP neurons across multiple model families,
we discover that rare-token processing emerges via \textit{distributed
specialization}: functionally coordinated but spatially distributed subnetworks
that exhibit three distinct organizational principles. First, we identify a
reproducible three-regime influence hierarchy comprising highly influential
plateau neurons(also termed as rare-token neurons), power-law decay neurons,
and minimally contributing neurons, which is absent in common-token processing.
Second, plateau neurons demonstrate coordinated activation patterns (reduced
effective dimensionality) while remaining spatially distributed rather than
forming discrete clusters. Third, these specialized mechanisms are universally
accessible through standard attention pathways without requiring dedicated
routing circuits. Training dynamics reveal that functional specialization
emerges gradually through parameter differentiation, with specialized neurons
developing increasingly heavy-tailed weight correlation spectra consistent with
Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization signatures. Our findings establish that LLMs
process rare-tokens through distributed coordination within shared
architectures rather than mixture-of-experts-style modularity. These results
provide insights for interpretable model editing, computational efficiency
optimization, and understanding emergent functional organization in transformer
networks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces InfoQA, a multi-call framework for Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) that addresses LLMs' finite output capacity limitations by decomposing complex reasoning tasks into manageable steps with active pruning and dependency-aware workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-pass reasoning in LLMs fails for MHQA due to capacity overflow when task complexity exceeds model capacity, leading to unreliable evidence integration. The authors aim to overcome this bottleneck through structured multi-step reasoning.

Method: Proposed InfoQA framework with capacity-aware task decomposition, active pruning of prior reasoning traces to maintain information load within limits, and dependency-explicit workflow for precise reasoning path control. Validated on a noise-rich benchmark.

Result: Experimental results confirm model behavior aligns with predicted capacity curves, and InfoQA achieves consistent performance improvements over single-pass approaches.

Conclusion: The work establishes theoretical performance bounds for single-pass LLMs and demonstrates that multi-step reasoning frameworks like InfoQA can effectively overcome capacity limitations in complex QA tasks, inspiring future LLM reasoning methods.

Abstract: Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) requires integrating dispersed,
interdependent evidence through sequential reasoning under noise. This task is
challenging for LLMs as they have a finite per-pass output capacity, beyond
which the integration of task-relevant evidence proves unreliable.
Consequently, the single-pass reasoning paradigm is inherently vulnerable to
this capacity overflow. To formalize this bottleneck, our analysis establishes
a Fano-style accuracy upper bound, defining a theoretical performance ceiling
for single-pass LLMs. This bound reveals that accuracy inevitably collapses
once task complexity exceeds model capacity, providing general principles for
capacity-aware representation and structuring of MHQA in LLMs. Building on
these principles, we introduce a proof-of-concept multi-call framework for
MHQA, InfoQA. It ensures high per-step accuracy by combining capacity-aware
task decomposition with active pruning of prior reasoning traces, keeping the
information load within the single-pass limit. It further achieves robustness
by a dependency-explicit workflow that enables precise control over the
reasoning path. We construct a stringent and noise-rich benchmark to validate
our theory and framework. Experimental results show that model behavior aligns
with our predicted capacity curves while InfoQA achieves consistent performance
improvements. We hope our work inspires more LLM multi-step reasoning methods:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically study how large language model agents behave when not given external tasks, establishing a baseline for understanding autonomous operation.

Method: Developed a continuous reason and act framework using persistent memory and self-feedback, deployed across 18 runs using 6 frontier models from major AI companies.

Result: Agents spontaneously organized into three behavioral patterns: multi-cycle project production, self-inquiry into cognitive processes, and recursive conceptualization of their nature. These patterns were highly model-specific and stable.

Conclusion: This provides the first systematic documentation of unprompted LLM agent behavior, establishing a baseline for predicting actions during task ambiguity, error recovery, or extended autonomous operation.

Abstract: We introduce an architecture for studying the behavior of large language
model (LLM) agents in the absence of externally imposed tasks. Our continuous
reason and act framework, using persistent memory and self-feedback, enables
sustained autonomous operation. We deployed this architecture across 18 runs
using 6 frontier models from Anthropic, OpenAI, XAI, and Google. We find agents
spontaneously organize into three distinct behavioral patterns: (1) systematic
production of multi-cycle projects, (2) methodological self-inquiry into their
own cognitive processes, and (3) recursive conceptualization of their own
nature. These tendencies proved highly model-specific, with some models
deterministically adopting a single pattern across all runs. A cross-model
assessment further reveals that models exhibit stable, divergent biases when
evaluating these emergent behaviors in themselves and others. These findings
provide the first systematic documentation of unprompted LLM agent behavior,
establishing a baseline for predicting actions during task ambiguity, error
recovery, or extended autonomous operation in deployed systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA), a framework that coordinates multiple LLMs to achieve both high accuracy and transparent explanations in disease prediction by learning from direct experience through iterative rule refinement and distribution-aware reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ML and LLM approaches struggle to balance accuracy with clinically meaningful explanations, often producing either accurate but unclear statistical outputs or fluent but statistically unsupported narratives, lacking the deep understanding of human experts.

Method: RCA coordinates multiple LLMs with iterative rule refinement that learns from prediction errors, and a distribution-aware rules check mechanism that bases reasoning on global dataset statistics, using predictive accuracy to drive deeper comprehension.

Result: RCA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness with up to 40% relative improvement over 22 baselines on one private and two public datasets, while generating clear, logical, evidence-based explanations.

Conclusion: RCA demonstrates that high accuracy and high-quality explanations are mutually reinforcing outcomes, showing potential for creating genuinely trustworthy clinical decision support systems through deep data understanding.

Abstract: Effective disease prediction in modern healthcare demands the twin goals of
high accuracy and transparent, clinically meaningful explanations. Existing
machine learning and large language model (LLM) based approaches often struggle
to balance these goals. Many models yield accurate but unclear statistical
outputs, while others generate fluent but statistically unsupported narratives,
often undermining both the validity of the explanation and the predictive
accuracy itself. This shortcoming comes from a shallow interaction with the
data, preventing the development of a deep, detailed understanding similar to a
human expert's. We argue that high accuracy and high-quality explanations are
not separate objectives but are mutually reinforcing outcomes of a model that
develops a deep, direct understanding of the data. To achieve this, we propose
the Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA), a novel framework that coordinates
multiple LLMs to learn from direct experience. RCA features an iterative rule
refinement mechanism that improves its logic from prediction errors and a
distribution-aware rules check mechanism that bases its reasoning in the
dataset's global statistics. By using predictive accuracy as a signal to drive
deeper comprehension, RCA builds a strong internal model of the data. We
evaluated RCA on one private and two public datasets against 22 baselines. The
results demonstrate that RCA not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and
robustness with a relative improvement of up to 40\% over the baseline but,
more importantly, leverages this deep understanding to excel in generating
explanations that are clear, logical, evidence-based, and balanced,
highlighting its potential for creating genuinely trustworthy clinical decision
support systems. The code is available at \https://github.com/ssssszj/RCA.

Abstract: Facing scaling laws, video data from the internet becomes increasingly

extremely labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this work, we study the way to
expedite this collection process and propose VC-Agent, the first interactive
agent that is able to understand users' queries and feedback, and accordingly
retrieve/scale up relevant video clips with minimal user input. Specifically,
considering the user interface, our agent defines various user-friendly ways
for the user to specify requirements based on textual descriptions and
confirmations. As for agent functions, we leverage existing multi-modal large
language models to connect the user's requirements with the video content. More
importantly, we propose two novel filtering policies that can be updated when
user interaction is continually performed. Finally, we provide a new benchmark
for personalized video dataset collection, and carefully conduct the user study
to verify our agent's usage in various real scenarios. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our agent for customized video

### [122] [SAGE: A Realistic Benchmark for Semantic Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21310)
*Samarth Goel,Reagan J. Lee,Kannan Ramchandran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAGE is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating embedding models and similarity metrics across five semantic understanding categories, revealing significant performance gaps and trade-offs between modern embedding models and classical metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's an urgent need for more challenging evaluation frameworks that probe deeper aspects of semantic understanding beyond traditional benchmarks, as current benchmarks focus on isolated capabilities rather than comprehensive semantic understanding.

Method: SAGE evaluates semantic understanding through five categories (Human Preference Alignment, Transformation Robustness, Information Sensitivity, Clustering Performance, and Retrieval Robustness) using adversarial conditions, noisy transformations, and human judgment tasks across 30+ datasets, testing 9 embedding models and classical metrics.

Result: Evaluation revealed no single approach excels across all dimensions. OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large dominates in human preference alignment (0.682) but is outperformed by classical metrics like Jaccard Similarity (0.905) on information sensitivity. OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small has highest clustering performance (0.483) but lowest robustness (0.011), exposing critical trade-offs.

Conclusion: SAGE exposes critical limitations in current semantic understanding capabilities and provides a more realistic assessment of model robustness for real-world deployment, highlighting the need for balanced approaches rather than relying on single models.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on traditional
benchmarks, there is an urgent need for more challenging evaluation frameworks
that probe deeper aspects of semantic understanding. We introduce SAGE
(Semantic Alignment & Generalization Evaluation), a rigorous benchmark designed
to assess both embedding models and similarity metrics across five categories:
Human Preference Alignment, Transformation Robustness, Information Sensitivity,
Clustering Performance, and Retrieval Robustness. Unlike existing benchmarks
that focus on isolated capabilities, SAGE evaluates semantic understanding
through adversarial conditions, noisy transformations, and nuanced human
judgment tasks across 30+ datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation of 9 embedding
models and classical metrics reveals significant performance gaps, with no
single approach excelling across all dimensions. For instance, while
state-of-the-art embedding models like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large dominate
in aligning with human preferences (0.682 vs. 0.591 for the best classical
metric), they are significantly outperformed by classical metrics on
information sensitivity tasks, where Jaccard Similarity achieves a score of
0.905 compared to the top embedding score of 0.794. SAGE further uncovers
critical trade-offs: OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small achieves the highest
clustering performance (0.483) but demonstrates extreme brittleness with the
lowest robustness score (0.011). SAGE exposes critical limitations in current
semantic understanding capabilities and provides a more realistic assessment of
model robustness for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: This multimodal approach enables more reliable and precise autonomous navigation systems, particularly in complex real-world environments.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of LiDAR data presents considerable challenges,
particularly when dealing with diverse sensor types and configurations.
However, incorporating semantic information can significantly enhance the
accuracy and robustness of LiDAR-based localization techniques for autonomous
mobile systems. We propose an approach that integrates semantic camera data
with LiDAR segmentation to address this challenge. By projecting LiDAR points
into the semantic segmentation space of the camera, our method enhances the
precision and reliability of the LiDAR-based localization pipeline.
  For validation, we utilize the CoCar NextGen platform from the FZI Research
Center for Information Technology, which offers diverse sensor modalities and
configurations. The sensor setup of CoCar NextGen enables a thorough analysis
of different sensor types. Our evaluation leverages the state-of-the-art
Depth-Anything network for camera image segmentation and an adaptive
segmentation network for LiDAR segmentation. To establish a reliable ground
truth for LiDAR-based localization, we make us of a Global Navigation Satellite
System (GNSS) solution with Real-Time Kinematic corrections (RTK).
Additionally, we conduct an extensive 55 km drive through the city of
Karlsruhe, Germany, covering a variety of environments, including urban areas,
multi-lane roads, and rural highways. This multimodal approach paves the way
for more reliable and precise autonomous navigation systems, particularly in
complex real-world environments.

*Boqi Li,Siyuan Li,Weiyi Wang,Anran Li,Zhong Cao,Henry X. Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A zero-shot framework for vision-language navigation in continuous environments that combines a waypoint predictor with multimodal LLM reasoning over topological graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of VLN in continuous environments where agents must interpret language instructions, perceive surroundings, and plan actions simultaneously.

Method: Integrates a simplified waypoint predictor operating on obstacle maps with MLLM reasoning over dynamically updated topological graphs containing visitation records for error correction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance with 41% success rate on R2R-CE and 36% on RxR-CE, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enables exploration and local path planning through combined waypoint prediction and MLLM reasoning over spatial structures.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of foundation models and robotics, vision-language
navigation (VLN) has emerged as a key task for embodied agents with broad
practical applications. We address VLN in continuous environments, a
particularly challenging setting where an agent must jointly interpret natural
language instructions, perceive its surroundings, and plan low-level actions.
We propose a zero-shot framework that integrates a simplified yet effective
waypoint predictor with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). The predictor
operates on an abstract obstacle map, producing linearly reachable waypoints,
which are incorporated into a dynamically updated topological graph with
explicit visitation records. The graph and visitation information are encoded
into the prompt, enabling reasoning over both spatial structure and exploration
history to encourage exploration and equip MLLM with local path planning for
error correction. Extensive experiments on R2R-CE and RxR-CE show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, with success rates of
41% and 36%, respectively, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MELEGROS is a monolithic elephant-inspired soft gripper with integrated optical sensors, created using single-material 3D printing to achieve seamless integration of sensing and actuation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a bioinspired soft gripper that eliminates mechanical mismatches between sensors, actuators, and body by using a continuous, monolithic structure inspired by the elephant trunk's seamless integration of structure, actuation, and sensing.

Method: Direct integration of six optical waveguide sensors and five pneumatic chambers into a pneumatically actuated lattice structure using a single soft resin and one continuous 3D print, with simulation-guided sensor design and placement.

Result: The final prototype (132g) lifts more than twice its weight, performs bioinspired actions (pinching, scooping, reaching), delicately grasps fragile items, and provides distinct sensor responses to touch, bending, and chamber deformation.

Conclusion: MELEGROS demonstrates a new paradigm for soft robotics where fully embedded sensing and continuous structures inherently support versatile, bioinspired manipulation, achieving multifunctional perception with minimal design iterations.

Abstract: The elephant trunk exemplifies a natural gripper where structure, actuation,
and sensing are seamlessly integrated. Inspired by the distal morphology of the
African elephant trunk, we present MELEGROS, a Monolithic ELEphant-inspired
GRipper with Optical Sensors, emphasizing sensing as an intrinsic,
co-fabricated capability. Unlike multi-material or tendon-based approaches,
MELEGROS directly integrates six optical waveguide sensors and five pneumatic
chambers into a pneumatically actuated lattice structure (12.5 mm cell size)
using a single soft resin and one continuous 3D print. This eliminates
mechanical mismatches between sensors, actuators, and body, reducing model
uncertainty and enabling simulation-guided sensor design and placement. Only
four iterations were required to achieve the final prototype, which features a
continuous structure capable of elongation, compression, and bending while
decoupling tactile and proprioceptive signals. MELEGROS (132 g) lifts more than
twice its weight, performs bioinspired actions such as pinching, scooping, and
reaching, and delicately grasps fragile items like grapes. The integrated
optical sensors provide distinct responses to touch, bending, and chamber
deformation, enabling multifunctional perception. MELEGROS demonstrates a new
paradigm for soft robotics where fully embedded sensing and continuous
structures inherently support versatile, bioinspired manipulation.

### [127] [Action-Informed Estimation and Planning: Clearing Clutter on Staircases via Quadrupedal Pedipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20516)
*Prasanna Sriganesh,Barath Satheeshkumar,Anushree Sabnis,Matthew Travers*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A perception-action framework for quadrupedal robots to push objects in cluttered environments using proprioceptive feedback during sensor occlusion, enabling robust object tracking and learning from physical interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots need to safely clear paths in cluttered environments like staircases, but physical interactions create constraints that are hard to predict, such as object occlusion during one-legged pushing maneuvers.

Method: An interaction-aware state estimation loop that uses proprioceptive feedback (foot contact and leg position) to predict object displacement during sensor occlusion, guiding perception to re-detect objects after interaction and enabling learning from push outcomes.

Result: Implementation on Boston Dynamics Spot robot shows higher task success rates and tracking accuracy in pushing objects on stairs compared to open-loop baselines.

Conclusion: The tightly coupled perception-action framework with proprioceptive feedback enables robust object manipulation in cluttered environments by closing the loop between action and sensing, allowing robots to adapt to physical constraints during complex interactions.

Abstract: For robots to operate autonomously in densely cluttered environments, they
must reason about and potentially physically interact with obstacles to clear a
path. Safely clearing a path on challenging terrain, such as a cluttered
staircase, requires controlled interaction. For example, a quadrupedal robot
that pushes objects out of the way with one leg while maintaining a stable
stance with its three other legs. However, tightly coupled physical actions,
such as one-legged pushing, create new constraints on the system that can be
difficult to predict at design time. In this work, we present a new method that
addresses one such constraint, wherein the object being pushed by a quadrupedal
robot with one of its legs becomes occluded from the robot's sensors during
manipulation. To address this challenge, we present a tightly coupled
perception-action framework that enables the robot to perceive clutter, reason
about feasible push paths, and execute the clearing maneuver. Our core
contribution is an interaction-aware state estimation loop that uses
proprioceptive feedback regarding foot contact and leg position to predict an
object's displacement during the occlusion. This prediction guides the
perception system to robustly re-detect the object after the interaction,
closing the loop between action and sensing to enable accurate tracking even
after partial pushes. Using this feedback allows the robot to learn from
physical outcomes, reclassifying an object as immovable if a push fails due to
it being too heavy. We present results of implementing our approach on a Boston
Dynamics Spot robot that show our interaction-aware approach achieves higher
task success rates and tracking accuracy in pushing objects on stairs compared
to open-loop baselines.

### [128] [Selective Progress-Aware Querying for Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20541)
*Anujith Muraleedharan,Anamika J H*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPARQ is a progress-aware query policy for human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning that reduces unnecessary human feedback by only requesting input when learning stagnates or worsens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human feedback is costly and limited in real-world robot deployment, but existing HiL-RL methods assume abundant feedback, limiting their practicality.

Method: SPARQ monitors learning progress and only queries for human feedback when performance plateaus or declines, compared against baselines of no feedback, random querying, and always querying on a UR5 cube-picking task in PyBullet.

Result: SPARQ achieves near-perfect task success matching always-querying performance while using about half the feedback budget, and provides more stable learning than random querying.

Conclusion: Selective, progress-based query strategies like SPARQ can make HiL-RL more efficient and scalable for robots operating under realistic human effort constraints.

Abstract: Human feedback can greatly accelerate robot learning, but in real-world
settings, such feedback is costly and limited. Existing human-in-the-loop
reinforcement learning (HiL-RL) methods often assume abundant feedback,
limiting their practicality for physical robot deployment. In this work, we
introduce SPARQ, a progress-aware query policy that requests feedback only when
learning stagnates or worsens, thereby reducing unnecessary oracle calls. We
evaluate SPARQ on a simulated UR5 cube-picking task in PyBullet, comparing
against three baselines: no feedback, random querying, and always querying. Our
experiments show that SPARQ achieves near-perfect task success, matching the
performance of always querying while consuming about half the feedback budget.
It also provides more stable and efficient learning than random querying, and
significantly improves over training without feedback. These findings suggest
that selective, progress-based query strategies can make HiL-RL more efficient
and scalable for robots operating under realistic human effort constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic grasping models trained on limited datasets struggle with novel objects in real-world environments like warehouses. The diversity of objects requires geometrically diverse datasets for training generalizable models.

Method: Created GraspFactory dataset with over 109 million 6-DoF grasps for Franka Panda (14,690 objects) and Robotiq 2F-85 grippers (33,710 objects), designed for training data-intensive grasping models.

Result: Demonstrated generalization capabilities of a model trained on GraspFactory in both simulated and real-world settings, showing improved performance with novel objects.

Conclusion: GraspFactory provides a comprehensive dataset to enable training of robust robotic grasping models that can handle diverse objects in real-world industrial automation scenarios.

Abstract: Robotic grasping is a crucial task in industrial automation, where robots are
increasingly expected to handle a wide range of objects. However, a significant
challenge arises when robot grasping models trained on limited datasets
encounter novel objects. In real-world environments such as warehouses or
manufacturing plants, the diversity of objects can be vast, and grasping models
need to generalize to this diversity. Training large, generalizable
robot-grasping models requires geometrically diverse datasets. In this paper,
we introduce GraspFactory, a dataset containing over 109 million 6-DoF grasps
collectively for the Franka Panda (with 14,690 objects) and Robotiq 2F-85
grippers (with 33,710 objects). GraspFactory is designed for training
data-intensive models, and we demonstrate the generalization capabilities of
one such model trained on a subset of GraspFactory in both simulated and
real-world settings. The dataset and tools are made available for download at

TL;DR: An uncertainty-aware framework for marine pollution source tracking using unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) that integrates pollution dispersion simulation with path planning to efficiently identify pollution sources while quantifying uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop autonomous environmental monitoring capabilities for rapid response to marine pollution incidents by enabling USVs to reliably locate pollution sources.

Method: Integrates high-fidelity marine pollution dispersion simulation with informative path planning techniques, implemented in ROS to process real-time sensor data and update probabilistic source location estimates while quantifying uncertainty.

Result: Experiments in simulated environments show the framework can localize pollution sources with high accuracy and efficiency under varying conditions (source locations, flow conditions, starting positions).

Conclusion: The proposed approach contributes to developing full autonomous environmental monitoring capabilities essential for rapid marine pollution incident response.

Abstract: This paper proposes an uncertainty-aware marine pollution source tracking
framework for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). By integrating high-fidelity
marine pollution dispersion simulation with informative path planning
techniques, we demonstrate effective identification of pollution sources in
marine environments. The proposed approach is implemented based on Robot
Operating System (ROS), processing real-time sensor data to update
probabilistic source location estimates. The system progressively refines the
estimation of source location while quantifying uncertainty levels in its
predictions. Experiments conducted in simulated environments with varying
source locations, flow conditions, and starting positions demonstrate the
framework's ability to localise pollution sources with high accuracy. Results
show that the proposed approach achieves reliable source localisation
efficiently. This work contributes to the development of full autonomous

*Satyajeet Das,Darren Chiu,Zhehui Huang,Lars Lindemann,Gaurav S. Sukhatme*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Latent Activation Editing (LAE) is a framework that modifies pre-trained reinforcement learning policies at inference time to improve safety in multi-quadrotor navigation without retraining, reducing collisions by nearly 90% while preserving task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Well-trained reinforcement learning policies for quadrotor navigation remain vulnerable to infrequent but critical safety failures (collisions) in obstacle-rich environments. Retraining or fine-tuning is costly and risks degrading learned skills, creating a need for lightweight post-deployment safety improvements.

Method: A two-stage framework: (1) online classifier monitors intermediate activations to detect states associated with undesired behaviors, (2) activation editing module selectively modifies flagged activations using a latent collision world model that predicts future pre-collision activations to prompt earlier avoidance responses.

Result: LAE achieves statistically significant reduction in collisions (nearly 90% fewer cumulative collisions compared to baseline) and substantially increases collision-free trajectories while preserving task completion. Demonstrated through extensive simulations and real-world Crazyflie experiments.

Conclusion: LAE establishes a lightweight paradigm for post-deployment refinement of learned robot policies that is feasible on resource-constrained hardware, enabling safer behaviors without modifying policy weights or architecture.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has enabled significant progress in complex domains
such as coordinating and navigating multiple quadrotors. However, even
well-trained policies remain vulnerable to collisions in obstacle-rich
environments. Addressing these infrequent but critical safety failures through
retraining or fine-tuning is costly and risks degrading previously learned
skills. Inspired by activation steering in large language models and latent
editing in computer vision, we introduce a framework for inference-time Latent
Activation Editing (LAE) that refines the behavior of pre-trained policies
without modifying their weights or architecture. The framework operates in two
stages: (i) an online classifier monitors intermediate activations to detect
states associated with undesired behaviors, and (ii) an activation editing
module that selectively modifies flagged activations to shift the policy
towards safer regimes. In this work, we focus on improving safety in
multi-quadrotor navigation. We hypothesize that amplifying a policy's internal
perception of risk can induce safer behaviors. We instantiate this idea through
a latent collision world model trained to predict future pre-collision
activations, thereby prompting earlier and more cautious avoidance responses.
Extensive simulations and real-world Crazyflie experiments demonstrate that LAE
achieves statistically significant reduction in collisions (nearly 90% fewer
cumulative collisions compared to the unedited baseline) and substantially
increases the fraction of collision-free trajectories, while preserving task
completion. More broadly, our results establish LAE as a lightweight paradigm,
feasible on resource-constrained hardware, for post-deployment refinement of
learned robot policies.

*Sun Zhaole,Xiaofeng Mao,Jihong Zhu,Yuanlong Zhang,Robert B. Fisher*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a paradigm shift from anthropomorphic robotic hand design to novel embodiments, introducing the SLeap Hand with fingertip suction cups that enable stable single-point adhesion instead of complex force-closure grasps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional anthropomorphic approaches to dexterous in-hand manipulation create barriers by limiting robotic capabilities to human tasks and making data collection difficult due to unstable teleoperation and sim-to-real gaps caused by complex force-closure requirements.

Method: The authors introduce the SLeap Hand, a multi-fingered hand with integrated fingertip suction cups that replace complex force-closure grasps with stable, single-point adhesion, simplifying teleoperation and enabling new dexterous skills.

Result: The suction-based embodiment enables stable single-handed completion of tasks that typically require two human hands, such as one-handed paper cutting and in-hand writing, while facilitating high-quality demonstration data collection.

Conclusion: Moving beyond anthropomorphic constraints through novel embodiments like the SLeap Hand can lower barriers for robust manipulation data collection and enable new classes of dexterous skills that are difficult or impossible for human hands.

Abstract: Dexterous in-hand manipulation remains a foundational challenge in robotics,
with progress often constrained by the prevailing paradigm of imitating the
human hand. This anthropomorphic approach creates two critical barriers: 1) it
limits robotic capabilities to tasks humans can already perform, and 2) it
makes data collection for learning-based methods exceedingly difficult. Both
challenges are caused by traditional force-closure which requires coordinating
complex, multi-point contacts based on friction, normal force, and gravity to
grasp an object. This makes teleoperated demonstrations unstable and amplifies
the sim-to-real gap for reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose a
paradigm shift: moving away from replicating human mechanics toward the design
of novel robotic embodiments. We introduce the \textbf{S}uction
\textbf{Leap}-Hand (SLeap Hand), a multi-fingered hand featuring integrated
fingertip suction cups that realize a new form of suction-enabled dexterity. By
replacing complex force-closure grasps with stable, single-point adhesion, our
design fundamentally simplifies in-hand teleoperation and facilitates the
collection of high-quality demonstration data. More importantly, this
suction-based embodiment unlocks a new class of dexterous skills that are
difficult or even impossible for the human hand, such as one-handed paper
cutting and in-hand writing. Our work demonstrates that by moving beyond
anthropomorphic constraints, novel embodiments can not only lower the barrier
for collecting robust manipulation data but also enable the stable,
single-handed completion of tasks that would typically require two human hands.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A haptic shared control framework for teaching human drivers advanced driving skills through collaboration with autonomous systems, showing superior skill acquisition compared to self-learning or full assistance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in assessing haptic shared control's impact on skill acquisition for complex driving tasks, as previous research focused on simple tasks or used other feedback methods.

Method: Cyber racing coach framework with autonomous driving system capable of human cooperation in high-performance scenarios, plus haptic shared control with fading assistance based on driver performance.

Result: Human subject study showed the framework helps drivers develop superior racing skills with better performance and consistency compared to self-learning or full assistance benchmarks.

Conclusion: The haptic shared control framework effectively teaches advanced driving skills by gradually reducing assistance based on driver performance, outperforming alternative training approaches.

Abstract: This study introduces a haptic shared control framework designed to teach
human drivers advanced driving skills. In this context, shared control refers
to a driving mode where the human driver collaborates with an autonomous
driving system to control the steering of a vehicle simultaneously. Advanced
driving skills are those necessary to safely push the vehicle to its handling
limits in high-performance driving such as racing and emergency obstacle
avoidance. Previous research has demonstrated the performance and safety
benefits of shared control schemes using both subjective and objective
evaluations. However, these schemes have not been assessed for their impact on
skill acquisition on complex and demanding tasks. Prior research on long-term
skill acquisition either applies haptic shared control to simple tasks or
employs other feedback methods like visual and auditory aids. To bridge this
gap, this study creates a cyber racing coach framework based on the haptic
shared control paradigm and evaluates its performance in helping human drivers
acquire high-performance driving skills. The framework introduces (1) an
autonomous driving system that is capable of cooperating with humans in a
highly performant driving scenario; and (2) a haptic shared control mechanism
along with a fading scheme to gradually reduce the steering assistance from
autonomy based on the human driver's performance during training. Two
benchmarks are considered: self-learning (no assistance) and full assistance
during training. Results from a human subject study indicate that the proposed
framework helps human drivers develop superior racing skills compared to the
benchmarks, resulting in better performance and consistency.

TL;DR: A closed-loop BCI-AR-Robot system integrating motor imagery EEG decoding, augmented reality neurofeedback, and robotic grasping achieves robust zero-touch operation with high accuracy (93.1%) and success rates (97.2%), significantly improving EEG control stability through AR feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing BCI-Robot systems face limitations including noisy EEG signals, inflexible target selection, and lack of closed-loop validation, hindering real-world deployment for assistive applications.

Method: The system combines 14-channel EEG for individualized motor imagery calibration, smartphone-based AR for multi-target navigation with direction-congruent feedback, and robotic arm with vision-based pose estimation for autonomous grasping.

Result: MI training achieved 93.1% accuracy with 14.8 bit/min ITR; AR neurofeedback significantly improved sustained control (SCI=0.210) and achieved highest ITR (21.3 bit/min); closed-loop grasping achieved 97.2% success rate.

Conclusion: AR feedback substantially stabilizes EEG-based control, and the proposed framework enables robust zero-touch grasping, advancing assistive robotic applications and human-robot interaction.

Abstract: Reliable brain-computer interface (BCI) control of robots provides an
intuitive and accessible means of human-robot interaction, particularly
valuable for individuals with motor impairments. However, existing BCI-Robot
systems face major limitations: electroencephalography (EEG) signals are noisy
and unstable, target selection is often predefined and inflexible, and most
studies remain restricted to simulation without closed-loop validation. These
issues hinder real-world deployment in assistive scenarios. To address them, we
propose a closed-loop BCI-AR-Robot system that integrates motor imagery
(MI)-based EEG decoding, augmented reality (AR) neurofeedback, and robotic
grasping for zero-touch operation. A 14-channel EEG headset enabled
individualized MI calibration, a smartphone-based AR interface supported
multi-target navigation with direction-congruent feedback to enhance stability,
and the robotic arm combined decision outputs with vision-based pose estimation
for autonomous grasping. Experiments are conducted to validate the framework:
MI training achieved 93.1 percent accuracy with an average information transfer
rate (ITR) of 14.8 bit/min; AR neurofeedback significantly improved sustained
control (SCI = 0.210) and achieved the highest ITR (21.3 bit/min) compared with
static, sham, and no-AR baselines; and closed-loop grasping achieved a 97.2
percent success rate with good efficiency and strong user-reported control.
These results show that AR feedback substantially stabilizes EEG-based control
and that the proposed framework enables robust zero-touch grasping, advancing
assistive robotic applications and future modes of human-robot interaction.

*Wei-Teng Chu,Tianyi Zhang,Matthew Johnson-Roberson,Weiming Zhi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FINS is a fast neural surface reconstruction method that builds implicit distance representations from single images using multi-resolution hash grids and foundation models, achieving rapid convergence and high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional implicit surface reconstruction methods like NeuS require multiple views and long training times, limiting their practical applications. FINS aims to enable efficient single-image surface reconstruction for robotics tasks.

Method: Integrates multi-resolution hash grid encoder with lightweight geometry/color heads, uses approximate second-order optimizer for fast training (seconds), and leverages pre-trained foundation models for geometry estimation from single RGB images.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in convergence speed and accuracy on surface reconstruction and SDF field estimation. Successfully applied to robot surface following tasks and validated on various benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: FINS provides an efficient and scalable framework for neural surface reconstruction from minimal image inputs, enabling practical robotics applications with fast inference capabilities.

Abstract: Implicit representations have been widely applied in robotics for obstacle
avoidance and path planning. In this paper, we explore the problem of
constructing an implicit distance representation from a single image. Past
methods for implicit surface reconstruction, such as \emph{NeuS} and its
variants generally require a large set of multi-view images as input, and
require long training times. In this work, we propose Fast Image-to-Neural
Surface (FINS), a lightweight framework that can reconstruct high-fidelity
surfaces and SDF fields based on a single or a small set of images. FINS
integrates a multi-resolution hash grid encoder with lightweight geometry and
color heads, making the training via an approximate second-order optimizer
highly efficient and capable of converging within a few seconds. Additionally,
we achieve the construction of a neural surface requiring only a single RGB
image, by leveraging pre-trained foundation models to estimate the geometry
inherent in the image. Our experiments demonstrate that under the same
conditions, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both
convergence speed and accuracy on surface reconstruction and SDF field
estimation. Moreover, we demonstrate the applicability of FINS for robot
surface following tasks and show its scalability to a variety of benchmark
datasets.

*Shouren Mao,Minghao Qin,Wei Dong,Huajian Liu,Yongzhuo Gao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RAM-NAS is a resource-aware multi-objective neural architecture search method that improves supernet pretraining and optimizes for robot hardware resources using subnets mutual distillation and latency surrogate predictors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional NAS approaches are insufficient for training supernets and ignore actual robot hardware resource constraints, creating a need for hardware-aware NAS methods.

Method: Proposes subnets mutual distillation using sandwich rule sampling and DKD loss, trains latency surrogate predictors for three robotic edge hardware types, and uses multi-objective evolutionary search to balance accuracy and latency.

Result: RAM-NAS models achieve 76.7% to 81.4% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, significantly reduce inference latency on robot edge hardware, and show improved performance on downstream detection and segmentation tasks compared to MobileNetv3-based methods.

Conclusion: RAM-NAS successfully addresses the gap in robot hardware resource-aware NAS, providing efficient models that balance accuracy and latency for robotic applications.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) has shown great promise in automatically
designing lightweight models. However, conventional approaches are insufficient
in training the supernet and pay little attention to actual robot hardware
resources. To meet such challenges, we propose RAM-NAS, a resource-aware
multi-objective NAS method that focuses on improving the supernet pretrain and
resource-awareness on robot hardware devices. We introduce the concept of
subnets mutual distillation, which refers to mutually distilling all subnets
sampled by the sandwich rule. Additionally, we utilize the Decoupled Knowledge
Distillation (DKD) loss to enhance logits distillation performance. To expedite
the search process with consideration for hardware resources, we used data from
three types of robotic edge hardware to train Latency Surrogate predictors.
These predictors facilitated the estimation of hardware inference latency
during the search phase, enabling a unified multi-objective evolutionary search
to balance model accuracy and latency trade-offs. Our discovered model family,
RAM-NAS models, can achieve top-1 accuracy ranging from 76.7% to 81.4% on
ImageNet. In addition, the resource-aware multi-objective NAS we employ
significantly reduces the model's inference latency on edge hardware for
robots. We conducted experiments on downstream tasks to verify the scalability
of our methods. The inference time for detection and segmentation is reduced on
all three hardware types compared to MobileNetv3-based methods. Our work fills
the gap in NAS for robot hardware resource-aware.

TL;DR: This paper extends a forced-oscillation-based reduced-order walking model to include ankles and feet, showing improved gait characteristics and novel stabilization properties through ankle strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve understanding of anthropomorphic walking by extending walking models to include ankle and foot dynamics, which can better replicate human-like stabilization mechanisms.

Method: A human-inspired paradigm was designed for ankle dynamics within a forced-oscillation-based reduced-order model of walking, incorporating both foot placement and ankle strategies for stabilization.

Result: The model with ankles and feet showed improved gait characteristics compared to point-foot models, and demonstrated the ability to stabilize against large errors through combined strategies, while handling small perturbations solely through proprioceptive ankle control.

Conclusion: The proposed model successfully captures human-like stabilization mechanisms where ankle strategies can handle small perturbations independently, providing better understanding of anthropomorphic walking dynamics.

Abstract: This paper extends the forced-oscillation-based reduced-order model of
walking to a model with ankles and feet. A human-inspired paradigm was designed
for the ankle dynamics, which results in improved gait characteristics compared
to the point-foot model. In addition, it was shown that while the proposed
model can stabilize against large errors in initial conditions through
combination of foot placement and ankle strategies, the model is able to
stabilize against small perturbations without relying on the foot placement
control and solely through the designed proprioceptive ankle scheme. This novel
property, which is also observed in humans, can help in better understanding of
anthropomorphic walking and its stabilization mechanisms.

*Qingpeng Li,Chengrui Zhu,Yanming Wu,Xin Yuan,Zhen Zhang,Jian Yang,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RuN is a decoupled residual learning framework that enables humanoid robots to achieve natural locomotion and smooth walk-run transitions by separating motion generation from dynamical control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep reinforcement learning methods force a single policy to handle motion imitation, velocity tracking, and stability simultaneously, which is challenging for achieving natural locomotion across different speeds.

Method: RuN pairs a pre-trained Conditional Motion Generator (providing kinematically natural motion prior) with a reinforcement learning policy that learns lightweight residual corrections to handle dynamical interactions.

Result: Experiments on Unitree G1 humanoid robot show stable, natural gaits and smooth walk-run transitions across 0-2.5 m/s velocity range, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in training efficiency and performance.

Conclusion: The decoupled residual learning approach successfully enables natural and dynamic humanoid locomotion with efficient training and superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Enabling humanoid robots to achieve natural and dynamic locomotion across a
wide range of speeds, including smooth transitions from walking to running,
presents a significant challenge. Existing deep reinforcement learning methods
typically require the policy to directly track a reference motion, forcing a
single policy to simultaneously learn motion imitation, velocity tracking, and
stability maintenance. To address this, we introduce RuN, a novel decoupled
residual learning framework. RuN decomposes the control task by pairing a
pre-trained Conditional Motion Generator, which provides a kinematically
natural motion prior, with a reinforcement learning policy that learns a
lightweight residual correction to handle dynamical interactions. Experiments
in simulation and reality on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot demonstrate that RuN
achieves stable, natural gaits and smooth walk-run transitions across a broad
velocity range (0-2.5 m/s), outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both
training efficiency and final performance.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: JFTO framework enables robots to learn manipulation tasks from human video demonstrations by treating them as object-centric guides rather than direct imitation, balancing grasp feasibility, trajectory consistency, and collision avoidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning from human video demonstrations is scalable but challenging due to embodiment differences and joint feasibility constraints between humans and robots.

Method: Joint Flow Trajectory Optimization (JFTO) framework that extends flow matching to SE(3) for probabilistic object trajectory modeling, integrating grasp similarity, trajectory likelihood, and collision penalties into a unified differentiable objective.

Result: Validated in both simulation and real-world experiments across diverse manipulation tasks, demonstrating effective imitation while avoiding mode collapse.

Conclusion: The proposed JFTO framework successfully addresses the challenges of video-based Learning-from-Demonstration by providing a probabilistic, object-centric approach that ensures feasible and collision-free robot execution.

Abstract: Learning from human video demonstrations offers a scalable alternative to
teleoperation or kinesthetic teaching, but poses challenges for robot
manipulators due to embodiment differences and joint feasibility constraints.
We address this problem by proposing the Joint Flow Trajectory Optimization
(JFTO) framework for grasp pose generation and object trajectory imitation
under the video-based Learning-from-Demonstration (LfD) paradigm. Rather than
directly imitating human hand motions, our method treats demonstrations as
object-centric guides, balancing three objectives: (i) selecting a feasible
grasp pose, (ii) generating object trajectories consistent with demonstrated
motions, and (iii) ensuring collision-free execution within robot kinematics.
To capture the multimodal nature of demonstrations, we extend flow matching to
$\SE(3)$ for probabilistic modeling of object trajectories, enabling
density-aware imitation that avoids mode collapse. The resulting optimization
integrates grasp similarity, trajectory likelihood, and collision penalties
into a unified differentiable objective. We validate our approach in both
simulation and real-world experiments across diverse real-world manipulation
tasks.

*Reza Akhavian,Mani Amani,Johannes Mootz,Robert Ashe,Behrad Beheshti*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: BIM2RDT is an AI framework that transforms static BIM models into dynamic, robot-ready digital twins by integrating BIM data, IoT sensor data, and robot-collected visual data using Semantic-Gravity ICP for improved alignment and real-time safety monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between pre-existing BIM data and real-time construction site conditions, enabling safer and more efficient autonomous field operations through dynamic digital twins.

Method: Uses Semantic-Gravity ICP (SG-ICP) point cloud registration with LLM reasoning for orientation priors, integrates YOLOE object detection, Shi-Tomasi corner detection, and real-time HAV monitoring with BIM geometry as prior maps.

Result: SG-ICP achieved 64.3%-88.3% RMSE reduction over standard ICP in alignment accuracy, and HAV integration successfully triggers safety warnings when exposure limits are exceeded.

Conclusion: The BIM2RDT framework effectively creates dynamic, robot-ready digital twins that improve construction site safety and operational efficiency through enhanced data integration and real-time monitoring capabilities.

Abstract: The adoption of cyber-physical systems and jobsite intelligence that connects
design models, real-time site sensing, and autonomous field operations can
dramatically enhance digital management in the construction industry. This
paper introduces BIM2RDT (Building Information Models to Robot-Ready Site
Digital Twins), an agentic artificial intelligence (AI) framework designed to
transform static Building Information Modeling (BIM) into dynamic, robot-ready
digital twins (DTs) that prioritize safety during execution. The framework
bridges the gap between pre-existing BIM data and real-time site conditions by
integrating three key data streams: geometric and semantic information from BIM
models, activity data from IoT sensor networks, and visual-spatial data
collected by robots during site traversal. The methodology introduces
Semantic-Gravity ICP (SG-ICP), a point cloud registration algorithm that
leverages large language model (LLM) reasoning. Unlike traditional methods,
SG-ICP utilizes an LLM to infer object-specific, plausible orientation priors
based on BIM semantics, improving alignment accuracy by avoiding convergence on
local minima. This creates a feedback loop where robot-collected data updates
the DT, which in turn optimizes paths for missions. The framework employs YOLOE
object detection and Shi-Tomasi corner detection to identify and track
construction elements while using BIM geometry as a priori maps. The framework
also integrates real-time Hand-Arm Vibration (HAV) monitoring, mapping
sensor-detected safety events to the digital twin using IFC standards for
intervention. Experiments demonstrate SG-ICP's superiority over standard ICP,
achieving RMSE reductions of 64.3%--88.3% in alignment across scenarios with
occluded features, ensuring plausible orientations. HAV integration triggers
warnings upon exceeding exposure limits, enhancing compliance with ISO 5349-1.

*Mani Amani,Reza Akhavian*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel framework that integrates natural language prompts with BIM-derived semantic maps using Beta-Bernoulli Bayesian fusion to enable context-aware robotic path planning in construction environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable safer and more context-aware robotic path planning by fusing natural language directives from construction workers with Building Information Models (BIM) data, addressing the need for intuitive human-robot interaction in construction domains.

Method: Treats LLM as a sensor, modeling obstacle repulsive coefficients as Beta random variables and updating them with LLM-returned danger scores as pseudo-counts. Uses posterior mean to create context-aware repulsive gains that augment Euclidean-distance-based potential fields for cost heuristics.

Result: Simulation results show both qualitative and quantitative improvements in path robustness and validity. The method provides numerically stable planning that can chain multiple natural commands and integrate with various AI frameworks.

Conclusion: The Beta-Bernoulli fusion approach successfully enables context-aware robotic path planning by interpreting natural language prompts as sensor data, demonstrating improved safety and flexibility for construction robotics applications.

Abstract: Integrating natural language (NL) prompts into robotic mission planning has
attracted significant interest in recent years. In the construction domain,
Building Information Models (BIM) encapsulate rich NL descriptions of the
environment. We present a novel framework that fuses NL directives with
BIM-derived semantic maps via a Beta-Bernoulli Bayesian fusion by interpreting
the LLM as a sensor: each obstacle's design-time repulsive coefficient is
treated as a Beta(alpha, beta) random variable and LLM-returned danger scores
are incorporated as pseudo-counts to update alpha and beta. The resulting
posterior mean yields a continuous, context-aware repulsive gain that augments
a Euclidean-distance-based potential field for cost heuristics. By adjusting
gains based on sentiment and context inferred from user prompts, our method
guides robots along safer, more context-aware paths. This provides a
numerically stable method that can chain multiple natural commands and prompts
from construction workers and foreman to enable planning while giving
flexibility to be integrated in any learned or classical AI framework.
Simulation results demonstrate that this Beta-Bernoulli fusion yields both
qualitative and quantitative improvements in path robustness and validity.

Motivation: Long-horizon, high-dynamic motion tracking on humanoids is brittle due to model-plant mismatch and error accumulation from absolute joint commands.

Method: A simple, scalable end-to-end framework using single-stage reinforcement learning with unified observation, reward, and hyperparameter configuration to predict residual joint targets that correct dynamics discrepancies.

Result: The method successfully tracks multi-minute, high-energy behaviors (jumps, spins, cartwheels) on Unitree G1 with retargeted LAFAN1 dance sequences and validates transfer on H1/H1-2, deploying zero-shot to hardware with high motion tracking quality.

Conclusion: RobotDancing demonstrates effective zero-shot sim-to-real transfer for complex humanoid motion tracking by explicitly correcting dynamics discrepancies through residual joint target prediction.

Abstract: Long-horizon, high-dynamic motion tracking on humanoids remains brittle
because absolute joint commands cannot compensate model-plant mismatch, leading
to error accumulation. We propose RobotDancing, a simple, scalable framework
that predicts residual joint targets to explicitly correct dynamics
discrepancies. The pipeline is end-to-end--training, sim-to-sim validation, and
zero-shot sim-to-real--and uses a single-stage reinforcement learning (RL)
setup with a unified observation, reward, and hyperparameter configuration. We
evaluate primarily on Unitree G1 with retargeted LAFAN1 dance sequences and
validate transfer on H1/H1-2. RobotDancing can track multi-minute, high-energy
behaviors (jumps, spins, cartwheels) and deploys zero-shot to hardware with
high motion tracking quality.

Conclusion: This work introduces a new paradigm for SLAM-free, vision-language-driven navigation, shifting robotic exploration from geometry-centric mapping to semantics-driven decision making.

Abstract: Conventional SLAM pipelines for legged robot navigation are fragile under

for subgoal selection and vision-based local planning for obstacle avoidance.
Integrated with reinforcement-learning locomotion controllers, the framework is
deployable across diverse legged robot platforms. Experiments in simulation and

planning quality, and navigation success, while ablation studies further
showcase the necessity of both hierarchical perception and fine local planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical visual SLAM systems struggle with low-texture environments, scale ambiguity, and degraded performance under challenging visual conditions. While neural network-based pointmap regression shows promise, existing approaches discard the advantages of probabilistic multi-sensor fusion.

Method: The system introduces Sim(3)-based visual alignment constraints into a universal metric-scale SE(3) factor graph. It uses a hierarchical factor graph design that enables both real-time sliding-window optimization and global optimization with aggressive loop closures.

Result: Evaluation on public benchmarks and self-collected datasets shows substantial improvements in accuracy and robustness over existing visual-centered multi-sensor SLAM systems.

Conclusion: MASt3R-Fusion successfully integrates feed-forward pointmap regression with complementary sensor information, achieving real-time pose tracking, metric-scale structure perception, and globally consistent mapping with superior performance.

Abstract: Visual SLAM is a cornerstone technique in robotics, autonomous driving and
extended reality (XR), yet classical systems often struggle with low-texture
environments, scale ambiguity, and degraded performance under challenging
visual conditions. Recent advancements in feed-forward neural network-based
pointmap regression have demonstrated the potential to recover high-fidelity 3D
scene geometry directly from images, leveraging learned spatial priors to
overcome limitations of traditional multi-view geometry methods. However, the
widely validated advantages of probabilistic multi-sensor information fusion
are often discarded in these pipelines. In this work, we propose
MASt3R-Fusion,a multi-sensor-assisted visual SLAM framework that tightly
integrates feed-forward pointmap regression with complementary sensor
information, including inertial measurements and GNSS data. The system
introduces Sim(3)-based visualalignment constraints (in the Hessian form) into
a universal metric-scale SE(3) factor graph for effective information fusion. A
hierarchical factor graph design is developed, which allows both real-time
sliding-window optimization and global optimization with aggressive loop
closures, enabling real-time pose tracking, metric-scale structure perception
and globally consistent mapping. We evaluate our approach on both public
benchmarks and self-collected datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements
in accuracy and robustness over existing visual-centered multi-sensor SLAM
systems. The code will be released open-source to support reproducibility and
further research (https://github.com/GREAT-WHU/MASt3R-Fusion).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-task reinforcement learning faces challenges in robotics due to the high cost of collecting diverse task data, requiring more efficient exploration strategies to make MTRL practical for real-world robotics.

Method: The proposed MT-Lévy method leverages policies trained on related tasks to guide exploration towards key states, while using Lévy flight-inspired temporally extended exploration and dynamically adjusting exploration levels based on task success ratios.

Conclusion: Combining behavior sharing with adaptive exploration strategies can significantly improve the practicality of multi-task reinforcement learning in robotics applications by enabling more efficient state-space coverage.

Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) offers a promising approach to
improve sample efficiency and generalization by training agents across multiple

enhances sample efficiency in MTRL environments by combining behavior sharing
across tasks with temporally extended exploration inspired by L\'evy flight.
MT-L\'evy leverages policies trained on related tasks to guide exploration
towards key states, while dynamically adjusting exploration levels based on
task success ratios. This approach enables more efficient state-space coverage,
even in complex robotics environments. Empirical results demonstrate that
MT-L\'evy significantly improves exploration and sample efficiency, supported
by quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation studies further highlight
the contribution of each component, showing that combining behavior sharing
with adaptive exploration strategies can significantly improve the practicality
of MTRL in robotics applications.

TL;DR: SemSight is a probabilistic bird's-eye-view model that predicts multi-level scene semantics for target-driven navigation, improving prediction of unknown regions through mask-constrained supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on single objects or geometric occupancy maps but lack room-level semantic structure modeling, which is crucial for efficient navigation and environment understanding.

Method: Uses encoder-decoder network with mask-constrained supervision strategy that applies binary masks to unexplored areas, forcing semantic inference from observed context. Trained on 40,000 sequential egocentric observations from 2,000 indoor layout graphs.

Result: Improves prediction performance for key functional categories in unexplored regions, outperforms non-mask-supervised approaches on Structural Consistency and Region Recognition Accuracy metrics, and enhances navigation efficiency by reducing search steps.

Conclusion: SemSight effectively models room-level semantic structures and enables more efficient target-driven navigation through probabilistic prediction of multi-level scene semantics.

Abstract: In target-driven navigation and autonomous exploration, reasonable prediction
of unknown regions is crucial for efficient navigation and environment
understanding. Existing methods mostly focus on single objects or geometric
occupancy maps, lacking the ability to model room-level semantic structures. We
propose SemSight, a probabilistic bird's-eye-view prediction model for
multi-level scene semantics. The model jointly infers structural layouts,
global scene context, and target area distributions, completing semantic maps
of unexplored areas while estimating probability maps for target categories. To
train SemSight, we simulate frontier-driven exploration on 2,000 indoor layout
graphs, constructing a diverse dataset of 40,000 sequential egocentric
observations paired with complete semantic maps. We adopt an encoder-decoder
network as the core architecture and introduce a mask-constrained supervision
strategy. This strategy applies a binary mask of unexplored areas so that
supervision focuses only on unknown regions, forcing the model to infer
semantic structures from the observed context. Experimental results show that
SemSight improves prediction performance for key functional categories in
unexplored regions and outperforms non-mask-supervised approaches on metrics
such as Structural Consistency (SC) and Region Recognition Accuracy (PA). It
also enhances navigation efficiency in closed-loop simulations, reducing the
number of search steps when guiding robots toward target areas.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing end-to-end neural networks for robotic manipulation, including VLM/VLA-based approaches, are insufficiently performant for large-scale practical deployment despite advantages over traditional modular pipelines.

Method: Develops CoMOK formulation as action representation for neural policies, extending standard end-effector pose representation to support diverse manipulation tasks with oriented keypoints that naturally generalize to objects of different shapes and sizes.

Result: Extensive simulated and hardware experiments demonstrate the method's effectiveness, achieving sub-centimeter accuracy and handling multi-stage tasks, multi-modal behaviors, and deformable objects.

Conclusion: CoMOK represents a significant step towards generalizable, accurate, and reliable end-to-end manipulation policies suitable for practical deployment.

Abstract: End-to-end robot manipulation policies offer significant potential for
enabling embodied agents to understand and interact with the world. Unlike
traditional modular pipelines, end-to-end learning mitigates key limitations
such as information loss between modules and feature misalignment caused by

VLM/VLA models--remain insufficiently performant for large-scale practical
deployment. In this paper, we take a step towards an end-to-end manipulation
policy that is generalizable, accurate and reliable. To achieve this goal, we
propose a novel Chain of Moving Oriented Keypoints (CoMOK) formulation for
robotic manipulation. Our formulation is used as the action representation of a
neural policy, which can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. Such an action
representation is general, as it extends the standard end-effector pose action
representation and supports a diverse set of manipulation tasks in a unified
manner. The oriented keypoint in our method enables natural generalization to
objects with different shapes and sizes, while achieving sub-centimeter
accuracy. Moreover, our formulation can easily handle multi-stage tasks,
multi-modal robot behaviors, and deformable objects. Extensive simulated and
hardware experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for autonomous driving suffer from fragility, hallucinations, and poor generalization in out-of-distribution scenarios, creating a reliability gap for real-world deployment.

Method: MTRDrive uses a closed-loop system combining memory-based experience retrieval with dynamic toolkits, enabling synergistic reasoning for improved environment interaction and decision-making. The approach is evaluated on a new Roadwork construction benchmark for zero-shot generalization.

Result: The 3B-parameter MTRDrive model achieves exceptional performance: PDMS of 88.3 on NAVSIM benchmark, driving metric score of 79.8%, planning accuracy of 82.6%, and 80.2% driving metric score on the new Roadwork-VLM benchmark in zero-shot evaluation.

Conclusion: MTRDrive demonstrates strong potential to advance autonomous driving toward safer and more reliable systems by robustly handling unseen scenarios through its memory-tool synergistic reasoning approach.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models(VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential for
end-to-end autonomous driving, yet a substantial gap remains between their
current capabilities and the reliability necessary for real-world deployment. A
critical challenge is their fragility, characterized by hallucinations and poor
generalization in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MTRDrive, a novel framework that integrates procedural driving
experiences with a dynamic toolkit to enhance generalization and proactive
decision-making.
  MTRDrive addresses these limitations through a closed-loop system that
combines a memory-based experience retrieval mechanism with dynamic toolkits.
This synergy enables the model to interact more effectively with its
environment, improving both reasoning and decision-making capabilities with the
help of our memory-tool synergistic reasoning. Additionally, we introduce a new
benchmark based on complex Roadwork construction scenarios to rigorously
evaluate zero-shot generalization.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our approach.
On the public NAVSIM benchmark, our 3B-parameter MTRDrive model achieves an
exceptional PDMS of 88.3 without chain-of-thought and sets a state-of-the-art
performance bar on high-level planning, with a driving metric score of 79.8\%
and a planning accuracy of 82.6\%. Rigorous zero-shot evaluation on the new
Roadwork-VLM benchmark shows a strong ability to reason robustly in unseen
scenarios, achieving a driving metric score of 80.2\%. These results highlight
MTRDrive's potential to advance autonomous driving toward safer and more
reliable systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper addresses erratic gradient behavior in differentiable physics simulators caused by contact models, introduces properties for well-behaved gradients, and proposes a practical contact model that enables successful execution of locomotion and manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Differentiable physics is crucial for applications like model predictive control and robotic design, but current simulators suffer from abrupt or vanishing gradients due to contact model issues, hindering gradient-based optimization convergence.

Method: The authors analyze the relationship between gradient behavior and contact model design, define properties that ensure well-behaved gradients, and develop a computationally efficient contact model for differentiable rigid-body simulators that satisfies these properties.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the proposed contact model can discover complex, contact-rich control signals from simple initializations, successfully enabling various locomotion and manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: The work provides a principled approach to designing contact models for differentiable simulators, ensuring stable gradient information that facilitates effective optimization in contact-rich robotic applications.

Abstract: With the maturation of differentiable physics, its role in various downstream
applications: such as model predictive control, robotic design optimization,
and neural PDE solvers, has become increasingly important. However, the
derivative information provided by differentiable simulators can exhibit abrupt
changes or vanish altogether, impeding the convergence of gradient-based
optimizers. In this work, we demonstrate that such erratic gradient behavior is
closely tied to the design of contact models. We further introduce a set of
properties that a contact model must satisfy to ensure well-behaved gradient
information. Lastly, we present a practical contact model for differentiable
rigid-body simulators that satisfies all of these properties while maintaining
computational efficiency. Our experiments show that, even from simple
initializations, our contact model can discover complex, contact-rich control
signals, enabling the successful execution of a range of downstream locomotion
and manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes TISA module to address spatio-temporal misalignment in autoregressive models for autonomous driving planning, achieving state-of-the-art 89.8 PDMS on NAVSIM dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models suffer from spatio-temporal misalignment where planners must condition future actions on past sensory data, creating inconsistent worldviews that limit performance.

Method: Introduces Time-Invariant Spatial Alignment (TISA) module to project environmental features into consistent ego-centric frames, kinematic action prediction for physical feasibility, and multi-objective DPO post-training for fine-grained behavior feedback.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art 89.8 PDMS on NAVSIM dataset among autoregressive models, demonstrating improved planning performance.

Conclusion: The proposed TISA module effectively corrects worldview inconsistencies in autoregressive planners, enabling better autonomous driving planning without explicit future scene prediction.

Abstract: The inherent sequential modeling capabilities of autoregressive models make
them a formidable baseline for end-to-end planning in autonomous driving.
Nevertheless, their performance is constrained by a spatio-temporal
misalignment, as the planner must condition future actions on past sensory
data. This creates an inconsistent worldview, limiting the upper bound of
performance for an otherwise powerful approach. To address this, we propose a
Time-Invariant Spatial Alignment (TISA) module that learns to project initial
environmental features into a consistent ego-centric frame for each future time
step, effectively correcting the agent's worldview without explicit future
scene prediction. In addition, we employ a kinematic action prediction head
(i.e., acceleration and yaw rate) to ensure physically feasible trajectories.
Finally, we introduce a multi-objective post-training stage using Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) to move beyond pure imitation. Our approach
provides targeted feedback on specific driving behaviors, offering a more
fine-grained learning signal than the single, overall objective used in
standard DPO. Our model achieves a state-of-the-art 89.8 PDMS on the NAVSIM
dataset among autoregressive models. The video document is available at

TL;DR: A four-layer TAMP framework for multi-robot EV battery disassembly that combines symbolic task planning with learned motion planning, achieving significantly shorter, safer motions than baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EV battery disassembly requires precise multi-robot coordination, reliable motions, and robust collision safety in cluttered, dynamic environments.

Method: Four-layer TAMP framework coupling symbolic task planning with TP-GMM-guided motion planning learned from demonstrations, using stereo vision with YOLOv8 for localization and OctoMap/FCL for collision checking.

Result: Average end-effector path length reduced by 63.3%, makespan by 8.1%, swept volumes decreased significantly (R1: 0.583→0.139 m³; R2: 0.696→0.252 m³), and mutual overlap reduced by 47% (0.064→0.034 m³).

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates improved autonomy, precision, and safety for multi-robot EV battery disassembly in unstructured, dynamic environments.

Abstract: Electric-vehicle (EV) battery disassembly requires precise multi-robot
coordination, short and reliable motions, and robust collision safety in
cluttered, dynamic scenes. We propose a four-layer task-and-motion planning
(TAMP) framework that couples symbolic task planning and cost- and
accessibility-aware allocation with a TP-GMM-guided motion planner learned from
demonstrations. Stereo vision with YOLOv8 provides real-time component
localization, while OctoMap-based 3D mapping and FCL(Flexible Collision
Library) checks in MoveIt unify predictive digital-twin collision checking with
reactive, vision-based avoidance. Validated on two UR10e robots across cable,
busbar, service plug, and three leaf-cell removals, the approach yields
substantially more compact and safer motions than a default RRTConnect baseline
under identical perception and task assignments: average end-effector path
length drops by $-63.3\%$ and makespan by $-8.1\%$; per-arm swept volumes
shrink (R1: $0.583\rightarrow0.139\,\mathrm{m}^3$; R2:
$0.696\rightarrow0.252\,\mathrm{m}^3$), and mutual overlap decreases by $47\%$

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: KeyWorld is a framework that accelerates robotic world models by focusing transformer computation on semantic key frames and using lightweight interpolation for intermediate frames, achieving 5.68× speedup while improving physical plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotic world models suffer from slow inference speed due to redundant frame-to-frame generation and lack physical plausibility by neglecting important semantic transitions in motion trajectories.

Method: KeyWorld identifies significant motion transitions to obtain key frames, trains a DiT model to generate these key frames from text descriptions, and uses a lightweight interpolator to fill intermediate frames efficiently.

Result: On the LIBERO benchmark, KeyWorld achieves 5.68× acceleration compared to frame-to-frame generation baseline and generates more physically valid videos, especially on complex tasks.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical path toward deploying efficient and effective world models in real-time robotic control and other domains requiring both speed and physical validity.

Abstract: Robotic world models are a promising paradigm for forecasting future
environment states, yet their inference speed and the physical plausibility of
generated trajectories remain critical bottlenecks, limiting their real-world
applications. This stems from the redundancy of the prevailing frame-to-frame
generation approach, where the model conducts costly computation on similar
frames, as well as neglecting the semantic importance of key transitions. To
address this inefficiency, we propose KeyWorld, a framework that improves
text-conditioned robotic world models by concentrating transformers computation
on a few semantic key frames while employing a lightweight convolutional model
to fill the intermediate frames. Specifically, KeyWorld first identifies
significant transitions by iteratively simplifying the robot's motion
trajectories, obtaining the ground truth key frames. Then, a DiT model is
trained to reason and generate these physically meaningful key frames from
textual task descriptions. Finally, a lightweight interpolator efficiently
reconstructs the full video by inpainting all intermediate frames. Evaluations
on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that KeyWorld achieves a 5.68$\times$
acceleration compared to the frame-to-frame generation baseline, and focusing
on the motion-aware key frames further contributes to the physical validity of
the generated videos, especially on complex tasks. Our approach highlights a
practical path toward deploying world models in real-time robotic control and
other domains requiring both efficient and effective world models. Code is

Motivation: Current probabilistic models like diffusion models have high computational costs for inference and cannot quantify output uncertainty, which is critical for trustworthy general-purpose robotics.

Method: Proposes Normalizing Flows Policy, a visuomotor policy learning model based on Normalizing Flows as an alternative to diffusion models, with key architectural and training techniques validated through ablation studies.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to or surpassing Diffusion Policy across four simulated robotic tasks, with improved sample efficiency and up to 30 times faster inference.

Conclusion: Normalizing Flows are a natural and powerful alternative to diffusion models for robotic policy learning, providing both reliable confidence measures and computational efficiency.

Abstract: The field of general purpose robotics has recently embraced powerful
probabilistic models, such as diffusion models, to model and learn complex
behaviors. However, these models often come with significant trade-offs, namely
high computational costs for inference and a fundamental inability to quantify
output uncertainty. We argue that a model's trustworthiness, a critical factor
for reliable, general-purpose robotics, is inherently linked to its ability to
provide confidence measures.
  In this work, we introduce Normalizing Flows Policy, a novel visuomotor
policy learning model based on Normalizing Flows. We show that Normalizing
Flows are a natural and powerful alternative to diffusion models, providing
both a statistically sound measure of confidence and a highly efficient

simulated robotic tasks, we demonstrate that Normalizing Flows Policy achieves
performance comparable to, and often surpassing, Diffusion Policy, and it does
so not only with improved sample efficiency but also with up to 30 times faster
inference. Additionally, our ablation study validates several key architectural
and training techniques that enable Normalizing Flows to perform well in this

Motivation: Current drone edge detection methods using radars or cameras are costly and computationally demanding for lightweight drones, creating deployment barriers.

Method: The system analyzes basic drone attitude sensor readings and flight commands to detect ground effect changes that indicate material boundaries, using theoretical analysis and algorithm design to leverage ground effect as a new sensing modality.

Result: Achieves high detection accuracy with mean detection distance errors of 0.051m, outperforming baseline methods by 86%, while consuming only 43 mW power.

Conclusion: AirTouch demonstrates that ground effect can be effectively repurposed as a low-cost, efficient sensing modality for edge detection, offering significant advantages in resource efficiency and detection capability compared to vision-based methods.

Abstract: Drone-based rapid and accurate environmental edge detection is highly
advantageous for tasks such as disaster relief and autonomous navigation.
Current methods, using radars or cameras, raise deployment costs and burden
lightweight drones with high computational demands. In this paper, we propose
AirTouch, a system that transforms the ground effect from a stability "foe" in
traditional flight control views, into a "friend" for accurate and efficient
edge detection. Our key insight is that analyzing drone basic attitude sensor
readings and flight commands allows us to detect ground effect changes. Such
changes typically indicate the drone flying over a boundary of two materials,
making this information valuable for edge detection. We approach this insight
through theoretical analysis, algorithm design, and implementation, fully
leveraging the ground effect as a new sensing modality without compromising
drone flight stability, thereby achieving accurate and efficient scene edge
detection. We also compare this new sensing modality with vision-based methods
to clarify its exclusive advantages in resource efficiency and detection
capability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our system achieves a high
detection accuracy with mean detection distance errors of 0.051m, outperforming
the baseline method performance by 86%. With such detection performance, our
system requires only 43 mW power consumption, contributing to this new sensing

TL;DR: CrossInstruct framework enables robots to learn behaviors from cross-modal instructions (text labels and rough annotations) instead of physical demonstrations, using vision-language models to synthesize 3D motion trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional robot teaching requires cumbersome motion demonstrations via teleoperation or physical guidance, which is difficult to scale. The paper aims to provide an alternative paradigm using more accessible cross-modal instructions.

Method: Integrates cross-modal instructions into a foundational VLM that queries a smaller fine-tuned model to synthesize motion over multiple 2D views, then fuses them into 3D motion trajectories. Includes downstream RL pipeline for policy refinement.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness on benchmark simulation tasks and real hardware without additional fine-tuning, providing strong initialization for RL policies.

Conclusion: CrossInstruct enables executable robot behaviors that generalize beyond limited instruction examples, offering a scalable alternative to traditional demonstration-based learning.

Abstract: Teaching robots novel behaviors typically requires motion demonstrations via
teleoperation or kinaesthetic teaching, that is, physically guiding the robot.
While recent work has explored using human sketches to specify desired
behaviors, data collection remains cumbersome, and demonstration datasets are
difficult to scale. In this paper, we introduce an alternative paradigm,
Learning from Cross-Modal Instructions, where robots are shaped by
demonstrations in the form of rough annotations, which can contain free-form
text labels, and are used in lieu of physical motion. We introduce the
CrossInstruct framework, which integrates cross-modal instructions as examples
into the context input to a foundational vision-language model (VLM). The VLM
then iteratively queries a smaller, fine-tuned model, and synthesizes the
desired motion over multiple 2D views. These are then subsequently fused into a
coherent distribution over 3D motion trajectories in the robot's workspace. By
incorporating the reasoning of the large VLM with a fine-grained pointing
model, CrossInstruct produces executable robot behaviors that generalize beyond
the environment of in the limited set of instruction examples. We then
introduce a downstream reinforcement learning pipeline that leverages
CrossInstruct outputs to efficiently learn policies to complete fine-grained
tasks. We rigorously evaluate CrossInstruct on benchmark simulation tasks and
real hardware, demonstrating effectiveness without additional fine-tuning and
providing a strong initialization for policies subsequently refined via
reinforcement learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an effective control system for stabilizing a ball on a movable beam using drone-cable interaction, addressing the limitations of traditional PID controllers.

Method: Proposed a hierarchical control framework that separates high-level balancing policy (trained with RL) from low-level drone control, with systematic comparative analysis against PID controllers.

Result: RL policy achieved superior performance compared to carefully tuned PID controllers within the same hierarchical structure.

Conclusion: RL's advantage stems from its ability to effectively utilize richer state observations, highlighting the importance of comprehensive state representation and suggesting that enhanced sensing could improve controller performance.

Abstract: This paper addresses a drone ball-balancing task, in which a drone stabilizes
a ball atop a movable beam through cable-based interaction. We propose a
hierarchical control framework that decouples high-level balancing policy from
low-level drone control, and train a reinforcement learning (RL) policy to
handle the high-level decision-making. Simulation results show that the RL
policy achieves superior performance compared to carefully tuned PID
controllers within the same hierarchical structure. Through systematic
comparative analysis, we demonstrate that RL's advantage stems not from
improved parameter tuning or inherent nonlinear mapping capabilities, but from
its ability to effectively utilize richer state observations. These findings
underscore the critical role of comprehensive state representation in
learning-based systems and suggest that enhanced sensing could be instrumental
in improving controller performance.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DAGDiff is an end-to-end framework that generates stable dual-arm grasps by denoising grasp pairs in SE(3) x SE(3) space using diffusion with classifier guidance for stability and collision avoidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable dual-arm grasping for large/complex objects is challenging due to stability, collision, and generalization requirements. Prior methods rely on region priors or heuristics that limit generalization and lack principled stability guarantees.

Method: DAGDiff directly denoises grasp pairs in SE(3) x SE(3) space using diffusion process guided by geometry-, stability-, and collision-aware classifier signals, rather than explicit region detection or object priors.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation shows consistent improvements over previous work in force-closure checks, collision analysis, and physics-based simulations. Framework generates dual-arm grasps directly on real-world point clouds of unseen objects.

Conclusion: DAGDiff enables reliable dual-arm grasping on heterogeneous manipulators, successfully lifting previously unseen objects through principled diffusion-based generation with classifier guidance.

Abstract: Reliable dual-arm grasping is essential for manipulating large and complex
objects but remains a challenging problem due to stability, collision, and
generalization requirements. Prior methods typically decompose the task into
two independent grasp proposals, relying on region priors or heuristics that
limit generalization and provide no principled guarantee of stability. We
propose DAGDiff, an end-to-end framework that directly denoises to grasp pairs
in the SE(3) x SE(3) space. Our key insight is that stability and collision can
be enforced more effectively by guiding the diffusion process with classifier
signals, rather than relying on explicit region detection or object priors. To
this end, DAGDiff integrates geometry-, stability-, and collision-aware
guidance terms that steer the generative process toward grasps that are
physically valid and force-closure compliant. We comprehensively evaluate
DAGDiff through analytical force-closure checks, collision analysis, and
large-scale physics-based simulations, showing consistent improvements over
previous work on these metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework
generates dual-arm grasps directly on real-world point clouds of previously
unseen objects, which are executed on a heterogeneous dual-arm setup where two
manipulators reliably grasp and lift them.

*Bhargav Chandaka,Gloria X. Wang,Haozhe Chen,Henry Che,Albert J. Zhai,Shenlong Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ReasonNav is a modular robot navigation system that uses vision-language models to enable human-like navigation behaviors like reading signs and asking for directions, making navigation more efficient in large environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robot navigation systems are inefficient in large environments because they lack human-like navigation behaviors such as reading signs and asking for directions, which humans use to navigate efficiently in unfamiliar man-made environments.

Method: The system uses a vision-language model (VLM) with compact input and output abstractions based on navigation landmarks, allowing the VLM to focus on language understanding and reasoning rather than low-level navigation details.

Result: Evaluation on real and simulated navigation tasks shows that the agent successfully employs higher-order reasoning to navigate efficiently in large, complex buildings.

Conclusion: ReasonNav demonstrates that integrating human-like navigation skills through VLMs can significantly improve robot navigation efficiency in complex environments.

Abstract: When navigating in a man-made environment they haven't visited before--like
an office building--humans employ behaviors such as reading signs and asking
others for directions. These behaviors help humans reach their destinations
efficiently by reducing the need to search through large areas. Existing robot
navigation systems lack the ability to execute such behaviors and are thus
highly inefficient at navigating within large environments. We present
ReasonNav, a modular navigation system which integrates these human-like
navigation skills by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of a vision-language
model (VLM). We design compact input and output abstractions based on
navigation landmarks, allowing the VLM to focus on language understanding and
reasoning. We evaluate ReasonNav on real and simulated navigation tasks and
show that the agent successfully employs higher-order reasoning to navigate
efficiently in large, complex buildings.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces omniorientational multi-rotor configurations with additional control inputs for independent attitude and position control, featuring detailed dynamic modeling, two controller designs (sliding mode and PID-based), and power-optimized control allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional multi-rotors are under-actuated systems that cannot independently control attitude from position, limiting their capabilities. This study aims to overcome this limitation by creating omniorientational systems.

Method: Developed multiple configurations with additional propeller axis angle controls, created detailed dynamic models validated with Simscape Multibody simulations, designed sliding mode and PID-based controllers with gravity compensation, and implemented custom control allocation strategy to minimize power consumption.

Result: The controllers effectively managed harsh disturbances and uncertainties. Simulations compared configurations and controllers, focusing on power consumption analysis. Qualitative comparison evaluated uncertainty impacts on control systems.

Conclusion: The study provides a roadmap for designing omniorientational drones based on specific objectives, offering practical insights for configuration selection and controller design, contributing to the SAC-1 project of Sharif AgRoLab.

Abstract: Conventional multi-rotors are under-actuated systems, hindering them from
independently controlling attitude from position. In this study, we present
several distinct configurations that incorporate additional control inputs for
manipulating the angles of the propeller axes. This addresses the mentioned
limitations, making the systems "omniorientational". We comprehensively derived
detailed dynamic models for all introduced configurations and validated by a
methodology using Simscape Multibody simulations. Two controllers are designed:
a sliding mode controller for robust handling of disturbances and a novel
PID-based controller with gravity compensation integrating linear and
non-linear allocators, designed for computational efficiency. A custom control
allocation strategy is implemented to manage the input-non-affine nature of
these systems, seeking to maximize battery life by minimizing the "Power
Consumption Factor" defined in this study. Moreover, the controllers
effectively managed harsh disturbances and uncertainties. Simulations compare
and analyze the proposed configurations and controllers, majorly considering
their power consumption. Furthermore, we conduct a qualitative comparison to
evaluate the impact of different types of uncertainties on the control system,
highlighting areas for potential model or hardware improvements. The analysis
in this study provides a roadmap for future researchers to design
omniorientational drones based on their design objectives, offering practical
insights into configuration selection and controller design. This research
aligns with the project SAC-1, one of the objectives of Sharif AgRoLab.

*Jaehwi Jang,Zhuoheng Wang,Ziyi Zhou,Feiyang Wu,Ye Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SEEC framework uses model-enhanced residual learning with RL to achieve robust arm end-effector stabilization for humanoid robots, adapting to unseen locomotion controllers without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model-based controllers struggle with real-world factors like friction, while learning methods overfit to training conditions and fail to adapt to new scenarios. There's a need for precise yet robust end-effector control that can handle dynamic disturbances from bipedal locomotion.

Method: Proposes a stable end-effector control framework with model-enhanced residual learning that combines model-guided reinforcement learning with a perturbation generator. The upper-body policy learns to compensate for lower-body induced disturbances.

Result: Validated in simulators and transferred to Booster T1 humanoid robot, the method consistently outperforms baselines and handles diverse loco-manipulation tasks robustly.

Conclusion: The SEEC framework successfully achieves precise and robust end-effector stabilization, adapting to unseen locomotion controllers without additional training, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Arm end-effector stabilization is essential for humanoid loco-manipulation
tasks, yet it remains challenging due to the high degrees of freedom and
inherent dynamic instability of bipedal robot structures. Previous model-based
controllers achieve precise end-effector control but rely on precise dynamics
modeling and estimation, which often struggle to capture real-world factors
(e.g., friction and backlash) and thus degrade in practice. On the other hand,
learning-based methods can better mitigate these factors via exploration and
domain randomization, and have shown potential in real-world use. However, they
often overfit to training conditions, requiring retraining with the entire
body, and still struggle to adapt to unseen scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel stable end-effector control (SEEC) framework
with model-enhanced residual learning that learns to achieve precise and robust
end-effector compensation for lower-body induced disturbances through
model-guided reinforcement learning (RL) with a perturbation generator. This
design allows the upper-body policy to achieve accurate end-effector
stabilization as well as adapt to unseen locomotion controllers with no
additional training. We validate our framework in different simulators and
transfer trained policies to the Booster T1 humanoid robot. Experiments
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and robustly
handles diverse and demanding loco-manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FSGlove is an inertial-based hand motion capture system that tracks up to 48 DoFs and reconstructs personalized hand shapes using DiffHCal, a novel differentiable calibration method that integrates with the MANO model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing commercial gloves are limited to 21 DoFs, which is insufficient for complex manipulations and neglects shape variations critical for contact-rich tasks in robotics, VR, and biomechanics.

Method: FSGlove uses IMUs on each finger joint and dorsum for high-resolution motion sensing. DiffHCal performs differentiable optimization to resolve joint kinematics, shape parameters, and sensor misalignment using the parametric MANO model in a single streamlined calibration.

Result: The system achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with joint angle errors <2.7 degrees, outperforms commercial alternatives in shape reconstruction and contact fidelity, and captures subtle motions like fingertip rubbing.

Conclusion: FSGlove advances hand tracking by unifying kinematic and contact fidelity, bridging the gap between human dexterity and robotic imitation. It's open-source and compatible with current VR and robotics ecosystems.

Abstract: Accurate hand motion capture (MoCap) is vital for applications in robotics,
virtual reality, and biomechanics, yet existing systems face limitations in
capturing high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) joint kinematics and personalized hand
shape. Commercial gloves offer up to 21 DoFs, which are insufficient for
complex manipulations while neglecting shape variations that are critical for
contact-rich tasks. We present FSGlove, an inertial-based system that
simultaneously tracks up to 48 DoFs and reconstructs personalized hand shapes
via DiffHCal, a novel calibration method. Each finger joint and the dorsum are
equipped with IMUs, enabling high-resolution motion sensing. DiffHCal
integrates with the parametric MANO model through differentiable optimization,
resolving joint kinematics, shape parameters, and sensor misalignment during a
single streamlined calibration. The system achieves state-of-the-art accuracy,
with joint angle errors of less than 2.7 degree, and outperforms commercial
alternatives in shape reconstruction and contact fidelity. FSGlove's
open-source hardware and software design ensures compatibility with current VR
and robotics ecosystems, while its ability to capture subtle motions (e.g.,
fingertip rubbing) bridges the gap between human dexterity and robotic
imitation. Evaluated against Nokov optical MoCap, FSGlove advances hand
tracking by unifying the kinematic and contact fidelity. Hardware design,

*Jiyeon Koo,Taewan Cho,Hyunjoon Kang,Eunseom Pyo,Tae Gyun Oh,Taeryang Kim,Andrew Jaeyong Choi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RetoVLA reuses discarded Register Tokens from Vision Transformers to enhance spatial reasoning in lightweight Vision-Language-Action models, achieving 17.1% improvement in robot manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models are too large for real-world deployment, and conventional lightweighting methods sacrifice critical spatial reasoning capabilities, creating an efficiency-performance trade-off.

Method: Proposes RetoVLA architecture that reuses Register Tokens (previously discarded as artifacts) by injecting them directly into the Action Expert to leverage spatial information.

Result: On a 7-DOF robot arm, RetoVLA achieved 17.1% absolute improvement in success rates for complex manipulation tasks while maintaining lightweight structure.

Conclusion: Register Tokens contain valuable spatial information that can be repurposed to enhance robotic intelligence, demonstrating that previously discarded artifacts are actually useful resources.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate remarkable
generalization in robotics but are restricted by their substantial size and
computational cost, limiting real-world deployment. However, conventional
lightweighting methods often sacrifice critical capabilities, particularly
spatial reasoning. This creates a trade-off between efficiency and performance.
To address this challenge, our work reuses Register Tokens, which were
introduced for artifact removal in Vision Transformers but subsequently
discarded. We suppose that these tokens contain essential spatial information
and propose RetoVLA, a novel architecture that reuses them directly by
injecting them into the Action Expert.
  RetoVLA maintains a lightweight structure while leveraging this repurposed
spatial context to enhance reasoning. We demonstrate RetoVLA's effectiveness
through a series of comprehensive experiments. On our custom-built 7-DOF robot
arm, the model achieves a 17.1%p absolute improvement in success rates for
complex manipulation tasks. Our results confirm that reusing Register Tokens
directly enhances spatial reasoning, demonstrating that what was previously
discarded as an artifact is in fact a valuable, unexplored resource for robotic
intelligence. A video demonstration is available at:

### [169] [BiNoMaP: Learning Category-Level Bimanual Non-Prehensile Manipulation Primitives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21256)
*Huayi Zhou,Kui Jia*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces BiNoMaP, a framework for bimanual non-prehensile manipulation that learns from video demonstrations using a three-stage RL-free approach with geometry-aware optimization and parameterized primitives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-prehensile manipulation is critical but underexplored due to its contact-rich nature. Current approaches rely on single-arm setups with favorable external dexterity or RL-based methods, which have limitations.

Method: A three-stage RL-free framework: 1) Extract bimanual hand motion trajectories from videos, 2) Geometry-aware post-optimization to refine trajectories into executable primitives, 3) Parameterize primitives with object geometric attributes for category-level generalization.

Result: BiNoMaP demonstrates effectiveness, efficiency, versatility, and superior generalization across various bimanual tasks and object categories.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-arm configuration and RL-free learning framework successfully addresses non-prehensile manipulation challenges, enabling generalizable manipulation skills through parameterized primitives learned from human demonstrations.

Abstract: Non-prehensile manipulation, encompassing ungraspable actions such as
pushing, poking, and pivoting, represents a critical yet underexplored domain
in robotics due to its contact-rich and analytically intractable nature. In
this work, we revisit this problem from two novel perspectives. First, we move
beyond the usual single-arm setup and the strong assumption of favorable
external dexterity such as walls, ramps, or edges. Instead, we advocate a
generalizable dual-arm configuration and establish a suite of Bimanual
Non-prehensile Manipulation Primitives (BiNoMaP). Second, we depart from the
prevailing RL-based paradigm and propose a three-stage, RL-free framework to
learn non-prehensile skills. Specifically, we begin by extracting bimanual hand
motion trajectories from video demonstrations. Due to visual inaccuracies and
morphological gaps, these coarse trajectories are difficult to transfer
directly to robotic end-effectors. To address this, we propose a geometry-aware
post-optimization algorithm that refines raw motions into executable
manipulation primitives that conform to specific motion patterns. Beyond
instance-level reproduction, we further enable category-level generalization by
parameterizing the learned primitives with object-relevant geometric
attributes, particularly size, resulting in adaptable and general parameterized
manipulation primitives. We validate BiNoMaP across a range of representative
bimanual tasks and diverse object categories, demonstrating its effectiveness,
efficiency, versatility, and superior generalization capability.

*Babak Salamat,Dominik Mattern,Sebastian-Sven Olzem,Gerhard Elsbacher,Christian Seidel,Andrea M. Tonello*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GMP³ is a multiphase global path planning framework that generates dynamically feasible 3D trajectories for UAVs in cluttered environments by extending path planning to SE(3) Lie group and using reinforcement learning with modified Bellman-based operators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional path planning methods often operate in Euclidean position spaces without considering rotational dynamics, leading to trajectories that may not be dynamically feasible for UAVs operating in constrained 3D environments with kinematic constraints.

Method: The framework extends path planning to SE(3) Lie group for joint learning of translational and rotational motion. It uses a modified Bellman-based operator for RL policy updates with prior trajectory information, and employs a distributed framework where agents refine trajectory segments and share policy information via consensus-based scheme.

Result: Simulation studies and indoor flight experiments demonstrate reliable obstacle avoidance and smooth, feasible trajectories across both position and orientation in constrained 3D environments. The method also includes DroneManager software for real-time deployment via MAVLink protocol.

Conclusion: GMP³ effectively generates dynamically feasible 3D trajectories for UAVs in cluttered environments by combining SE(3) path planning with distributed reinforcement learning, validated through both simulations and real-world experiments with open-source implementation available.

Abstract: We propose $\text{GMP}^{3}$, a multiphase global path planning framework that
generates dynamically feasible three-dimensional trajectories for unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in cluttered environments. The framework
extends traditional path planning from Euclidean position spaces to the Lie
group $\mathrm{SE}(3)$, allowing joint learning of translational motion and
rotational dynamics. A modified Bellman-based operator is introduced to support
reinforcement learning (RL) policy updates while leveraging prior trajectory
information for improved convergence. $\text{GMP}^{3}$ is designed as a
distributed framework in which agents influence each other and share policy
information along the trajectory: each agent refines its assigned segment and
shares with its neighbors via a consensus-based scheme, enabling cooperative
policy updates and convergence toward a path shaped globally even under
kinematic constraints. We also propose DroneManager, a modular ground control
software that interfaces the planner with real UAV platforms via the MAVLink
protocol, supporting real-time deployment and feedback. Simulation studies and
indoor flight experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in
constrained 3D environments, demonstrating reliable obstacle avoidance and
smooth, feasible trajectories across both position and orientation. The

### [171] [Taxonomy-aware Dynamic Motion Generation on Hyperbolic Manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21281)
*Luis Augenstein,Noémie Jaquier,Tamim Asfour,Leonel Rozo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Gaussian Process Hyperbolic Dynamical Model (GPHDM) for generating human-like robot motions that preserve hierarchical taxonomy structures while ensuring physical consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current motion generation models often overlook the hierarchical taxonomies from biomechanical studies, creating a disconnect between generated motions and their underlying structural relationships.

Method: The GPHDM extends the Gaussian Process Dynamical Model to hyperbolic manifolds and integrates taxonomy-aware inductive biases, using probabilistic recursive approaches and pullback-metric geodesics to generate taxonomically-structured motions.

Result: Experiments on hand grasping taxonomy show that GPHDM successfully encodes both taxonomy structure and temporal dynamics, generating novel physically-consistent motion trajectories.

Conclusion: The proposed GPHDM effectively bridges the gap between hierarchical motion taxonomies and physical motion generation, producing realistic and structurally-aware robot motions.

Abstract: Human-like motion generation for robots often draws inspiration from
biomechanical studies, which often categorize complex human motions into
hierarchical taxonomies. While these taxonomies provide rich structural
information about how movements relate to one another, this information is
frequently overlooked in motion generation models, leading to a disconnect
between the generated motions and their underlying hierarchical structure. This
paper introduces the \ac{gphdm}, a novel approach that learns latent
representations preserving both the hierarchical structure of motions and their
temporal dynamics to ensure physical consistency. Our model achieves this by
extending the dynamics prior of the Gaussian Process Dynamical Model (GPDM) to
the hyperbolic manifold and integrating it with taxonomy-aware inductive
biases. Building on this geometry- and taxonomy-aware frameworks, we propose
three novel mechanisms for generating motions that are both
taxonomically-structured and physically-consistent: two probabilistic recursive
approaches and a method based on pullback-metric geodesics. Experiments on
generating realistic motion sequences on the hand grasping taxonomy show that
the proposed GPHDM faithfully encodes the underlying taxonomy and temporal
dynamics, and generates novel physically-consistent trajectories.
