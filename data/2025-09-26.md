### [1] [Leveraging NTPs for Efficient Hallucination Detection in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20379)
*Ofir Azachi,Kfir Eliyahu,Eyal El Ani,Rom Himelstein,Roi Reichart,Yuval Pinter,Nitay Calderon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes using next-token probabilities (NTPs) from vision-language models as lightweight features for efficient hallucination detection, achieving comparable performance to larger VLMs while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models suffer from hallucinations (misalignments between visual content and generated text), and current detection methods using VLMs themselves are computationally intensive and increase latency. There's a need for more efficient detection approaches.

Method: Train traditional ML models using features based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs), which quantify model uncertainty. Augment with linguistic NTPs from text-only inputs and integrate VLM hallucination prediction scores.

Result: NTP-based features are effective predictors of hallucinations, enabling simple ML models to achieve performance comparable to strong VLMs. Combining NTPs with linguistic NTPs and VLM scores further enhances detection performance.

Conclusion: NTP-based lightweight methods provide efficient hallucination detection for VLMs, offering a simple solution to enhance model reliability without the computational overhead of using full VLMs for detection.

Abstract: Hallucinations of vision-language models (VLMs), which are misalignments
between visual content and generated text, undermine the reliability of VLMs.
One common approach for detecting them employs the same VLM, or a different
one, to assess generated outputs. This process is computationally intensive and
increases model latency. In this paper, we explore an efficient on-the-fly
method for hallucination detection by training traditional ML models over
signals based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs). NTPs provide a
direct quantification of model uncertainty. We hypothesize that high
uncertainty (i.e., a low NTP value) is strongly associated with hallucinations.
To test this, we introduce a dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements
derived from VLM-generated content, each labeled as hallucinated or not, and
use it to test our NTP-based lightweight method. Our results demonstrate that
NTP-based features are valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling fast and
simple ML models to achieve performance comparable to that of strong VLMs.
Furthermore, augmenting these NTPs with linguistic NTPs, computed by feeding
only the generated text back into the VLM, enhances hallucination detection
performance. Finally, integrating hallucination prediction scores from VLMs
into the NTP-based models led to better performance than using either VLMs or
NTPs alone. We hope this study paves the way for simple, lightweight solutions
that enhance the reliability of VLMs.

### [2] [Quasi-Synthetic Riemannian Data Generation for Writer-Independent Offline Signature Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20420)
*Elias N. Zois,Moises Diaz,Salem Said,Miguel A. Ferrer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A quasi-synthetic data generation framework using Riemannian geometry of SPD matrices for offline handwritten signature verification, achieving low error rates in writer-independent settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline handwritten signature verification is challenging in writer-independent settings, and existing methods rely on real-world datasets. The paper aims to overcome data dependency by generating synthetic data in Riemannian spaces.

Method: Uses Riemannian Gaussian Mixture on SPD matrices to generate synthetic writers and their properties. Riemannian Gaussian sampling creates positive and negative synthetic SPD populations, followed by metric learning with similar/dissimilar pairs.

Result: Experiments on Western and Asian signature datasets show low error rates under intra- and cross-dataset evaluation protocols, demonstrating efficacy in writer-independent verification.

Conclusion: The quasi-synthetic approach highlights the potential of generating synthetic data in Riemannian spaces for effective writer-independent signature verification systems.

Abstract: Offline handwritten signature verification remains a challenging task,
particularly in writer-independent settings where models must generalize across
unseen individuals. Recent developments have highlighted the advantage of
geometrically inspired representations, such as covariance descriptors on
Riemannian manifolds. However, past or present, handcrafted or data-driven
methods usually depend on real-world signature datasets for classifier
training. We introduce a quasi-synthetic data generation framework leveraging
the Riemannian geometry of Symmetric Positive Definite matrices (SPD). A small
set of genuine samples in the SPD space is the seed to a Riemannian Gaussian
Mixture which identifies Riemannian centers as synthetic writers and variances
as their properties. Riemannian Gaussian sampling on each center generates
positive as well as negative synthetic SPD populations. A metric learning
framework utilizes pairs of similar and dissimilar SPD points, subsequently
testing it over on real-world datasets. Experiments conducted on two popular
signature datasets, encompassing Western and Asian writing styles, demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed approach under both intra- and cross- dataset
evaluation protocols. The results indicate that our quasi-synthetic approach
achieves low error rates, highlighting the potential of generating synthetic
data in Riemannian spaces for writer-independent signature verification
systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Seedream 4.0 is an efficient multimodal image generation system that unifies text-to-image synthesis, image editing, and multi-image composition using a diffusion transformer with optimized VAE, achieving fast high-resolution image generation and state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified framework that extends traditional text-to-image systems into more interactive and multidimensional creative tools, pushing the boundaries of generative AI for both creativity and professional applications.

Method: Developed a highly efficient diffusion transformer with a powerful VAE that reduces image tokens, pretrained on billions of text-image pairs. Incorporated multi-modal post-training with fine-tuned VLM model, and used adversarial distillation, distribution matching, quantization, and speculative decoding for inference acceleration.

Result: Achieves inference time of up to 1.8 seconds for generating 2K images, demonstrates state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image editing, with exceptional capabilities in complex tasks including precise image editing, in-context reasoning, and multi-image reference.

Conclusion: Seedream 4.0 successfully extends traditional T2I systems into a more interactive creative tool, representing a significant advancement in multimodal generative AI with strong generalization capabilities across diverse applications.

Abstract: We introduce Seedream 4.0, an efficient and high-performance multimodal image
generation system that unifies text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, image editing,
and multi-image composition within a single framework. We develop a highly
efficient diffusion transformer with a powerful VAE which also can reduce the
number of image tokens considerably. This allows for efficient training of our
model, and enables it to fast generate native high-resolution images (e.g.,
1K-4K). Seedream 4.0 is pretrained on billions of text-image pairs spanning
diverse taxonomies and knowledge-centric concepts. Comprehensive data
collection across hundreds of vertical scenarios, coupled with optimized
strategies, ensures stable and large-scale training, with strong
generalization. By incorporating a carefully fine-tuned VLM model, we perform
multi-modal post-training for training both T2I and image editing tasks
jointly. For inference acceleration, we integrate adversarial distillation,
distribution matching, and quantization, as well as speculative decoding. It
achieves an inference time of up to 1.8 seconds for generating a 2K image
(without a LLM/VLM as PE model). Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Seedream
4.0 can achieve state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image
editing. In particular, it demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in
complex tasks, including precise image editing and in-context reasoning, and
also allows for multi-image reference, and can generate multiple output images.
This extends traditional T2I systems into an more interactive and
multidimensional creative tool, pushing the boundary of generative AI for both
creativity and professional applications. Seedream 4.0 is now accessible on
https://www.volcengine.com/experience/ark?launch=seedream.

### [4] [A Contrastive Learning Framework for Breast Cancer Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20474)
*Samia Saeed,Khuram Naveed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Contrastive Learning framework using ResNet-50 for breast cancer detection that achieves 96.7% accuracy on benchmark datasets, addressing the challenge of limited labeled data through semi-supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer deaths globally, and early detection is crucial for improving treatment outcomes. While deep learning methods show promise, they struggle with accuracy due to limited large-labeled datasets for training.

Method: The study uses a semi-supervised Contrastive Learning approach with ResNet-50, leveraging similarity index on large amounts of unlabeled mammogram data. Various augmentations and transformations are applied to improve performance, with final tuning on a small labeled dataset.

Result: The proposed method achieves 96.7% accuracy in detecting breast cancer on benchmark datasets INbreast and MIAS, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The Contrastive Learning framework effectively addresses the challenge of limited labeled data in medical imaging and demonstrates superior performance for breast cancer detection, making it a promising approach for early cancer diagnosis.

Abstract: Breast cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally,
accounts for a quarter of all cancer cases [1]. To lower this death rate, it is
crucial to detect tumors early, as early-stage detection significantly improves
treatment outcomes. Advances in non-invasive imaging techniques have made early
detection possible through computer-aided detection (CAD) systems which rely on
traditional image analysis to identify malignancies. However, there is a
growing shift towards deep learning methods due to their superior
effectiveness. Despite their potential, deep learning methods often struggle
with accuracy due to the limited availability of large-labeled datasets for
training. To address this issue, our study introduces a Contrastive Learning
(CL) framework, which excels with smaller labeled datasets. In this regard, we
train Resnet-50 in semi supervised CL approach using similarity index on a
large amount of unlabeled mammogram data. In this regard, we use various
augmentation and transformations which help improve the performance of our
approach. Finally, we tune our model on a small set of labelled data that
outperforms the existing state of the art. Specifically, we observed a 96.7%
accuracy in detecting breast cancer on benchmark datasets INbreast and MIAS.

### [5] [Are Foundation Models Ready for Industrial Defect Recognition? A Reality Check on Real-World Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20479)
*Simon Baeuerle,Pratik Khanna,Nils Friederich,Angelo Jovin Yamachui Sitcheu,Damir Shakirov,Andreas Steimer,Ralf Mikut*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foundation Models (FMs) show promise for automated quality inspection in manufacturing but fail on real-world industrial data despite performing well on public benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage FMs' zero-shot generalization capabilities for automated quality inspection in series manufacturing, replacing tedious labeling tasks with simple text prompts and enabling model reuse across multiple products.

Method: Tested multiple recent Foundation Models on both custom real-world industrial image data and public image datasets to evaluate their performance in zero-shot settings.

Result: All tested Foundation Models failed on real-world industrial image data, while the same models performed well on public benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Current Foundation Models are not yet suitable for real-world industrial quality inspection applications despite their promising zero-shot capabilities on public datasets.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) have shown impressive performance on various text and
image processing tasks. They can generalize across domains and datasets in a
zero-shot setting. This could make them suitable for automated quality
inspection during series manufacturing, where various types of images are being
evaluated for many different products. Replacing tedious labeling tasks with a
simple text prompt to describe anomalies and utilizing the same models across
many products would save significant efforts during model setup and
implementation. This is a strong advantage over supervised Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models, which are trained for individual applications and
require labeled training data. We test multiple recent FMs on both custom
real-world industrial image data and public image data. We show that all of
those models fail on our real-world data, while the very same models perform
well on public benchmark datasets.

### [6] [Shared Neural Space: Unified Precomputed Feature Encoding for Multi-Task and Cross Domain Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20481)
*Jing Li,Oskar Bartosz,Chengyu Wang,Michal Wnuczynski,Dilshan Godaliyadda,Michael Polley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a universal Neural Space (NS) using an encoder-decoder framework to create shared feature representations for multiple vision and imaging tasks, reducing redundancy and improving generalization across domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models in imaging and vision are customized for specific high-precision tasks, which is inefficient for applications requiring multiple modular tasks that each map to different latent domains.

Method: An encoder-decoder framework pre-computes features across vision tasks, where the encoder learns transformation-aware, generalizable representations that enable multiple downstream AI modules to share the same feature space. The backbone is lightweight and CNN-based.

Result: The proposed architecture reduces redundancy, improves generalization across domain shifts, and enables efficient multi-task vision pipelines. It demonstrates effectiveness for tasks like demosaicing, denoising, depth estimation, and semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: The universal Neural Space establishes a foundation for efficient multi-task vision pipelines, offering a lightweight alternative to larger transformer backbones while supporting various imaging and vision modules in a shared feature space.

Abstract: The majority of AI models in imaging and vision are customized to perform on
specific high-precision task. However, this strategy is inefficient for
applications with a series of modular tasks, since each requires a mapping into
a disparate latent domain. To address this inefficiency, we proposed a
universal Neural Space (NS), where an encoder-decoder framework pre-computes
features across vision and imaging tasks. Our encoder learns transformation
aware, generalizable representations, which enable multiple downstream AI
modules to share the same feature space. This architecture reduces redundancy,
improves generalization across domain shift, and establishes a foundation for
effecient multi-task vision pipelines. Furthermore, as opposed to larger
transformer backbones, our backbone is lightweight and CNN-based, allowing for
wider across hardware. We furthur demonstrate that imaging and vision modules,
such as demosaicing, denoising, depth estimation and semantic segmentation can
be performed efficiently in the NS.

*Dani Manjah,Tim Bary,Benoît Gérin,Benoît Macq,Christophe de Vleeschouwer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a strategy for selecting the most useful images for training edge camera models by combining high-confidence stream-based selection with diversity-based approaches to maximize model quality while minimizing transmission costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge camera systems need regular model updates but face computational constraints. Current approaches use complex teacher models on central servers to annotate data for training smaller edge models, but this creates transmission costs that need to be minimized while maintaining model quality.

Method: The method uses a high-confidence stream-based strategy combined with a diversity-based approach to select the most useful training images. This approach focuses on minimizing dataset queries while maintaining training iterations.

Result: The proposed strategy produces high-quality models with minimal dataset queries compared to traditional approaches, achieving similar training load (iterations) but with better efficiency.

Conclusion: Combining high-confidence stream-based selection with diversity-based approaches is an effective strategy for training edge camera models, enabling high model quality while keeping transmission costs low through intelligent data selection.

Abstract: Edge camera-based systems are continuously expanding, facing ever-evolving
environments that require regular model updates. In practice, complex teacher
models are run on a central server to annotate data, which is then used to
train smaller models tailored to the edge devices with limited computational
power. This work explores how to select the most useful images for training to
maximize model quality while keeping transmission costs low. Our work shows
that, for a similar training load (i.e., iterations), a high-confidence
stream-based strategy coupled with a diversity-based approach produces a
high-quality model with minimal dataset queries.

### [8] [InstructVTON: Optimal Auto-Masking and Natural-Language-Guided Interactive Style Control for Inpainting-Based Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20524)
*Julien Han,Shuwen Qiu,Qi Li,Xingzi Xu,Mehmet Saygin Seyfioglu,Kavosh Asadi,Karim Bouyarmane*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstructVTON is an instruction-following virtual try-on system that uses natural language instructions instead of manual masking to achieve fine-grained styling control on single or multiple garments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional virtual try-on models rely on binary masks which are difficult to create, require background knowledge, and cannot handle complex styling scenarios like changing sleeve positions without covering entire garment areas.

Method: Leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation models to automatically generate binary masks based on user-provided images and free-text style instructions, removing the need for manual mask creation.

Result: InstructVTON achieves state-of-the-art results with styling control and is interoperable with existing virtual try-on models, enabling complex try-on scenarios that were impossible with masking-based approaches alone.

Conclusion: The system simplifies the end-user experience by automating mask generation and enabling multiple rounds of image generation for complex styling scenarios, making virtual try-on more accessible and capable.

Abstract: We present InstructVTON, an instruction-following interactive virtual try-on
system that allows fine-grained and complex styling control of the resulting
generation, guided by natural language, on single or multiple garments. A
computationally efficient and scalable formulation of virtual try-on formulates
the problem as an image-guided or image-conditioned inpainting task. These
inpainting-based virtual try-on models commonly use a binary mask to control
the generation layout. Producing a mask that yields desirable result is
difficult, requires background knowledge, might be model dependent, and in some
cases impossible with the masking-based approach (e.g. trying on a long-sleeve
shirt with "sleeves rolled up" styling on a person wearing long-sleeve shirt
with sleeves down, where the mask will necessarily cover the entire sleeve).
InstructVTON leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation
models for automated binary mask generation. These masks are generated based on
user-provided images and free-text style instructions. InstructVTON simplifies
the end-user experience by removing the necessity of a precisely drawn mask,
and by automating execution of multiple rounds of image generation for try-on
scenarios that cannot be achieved with masking-based virtual try-on models
alone. We show that InstructVTON is interoperable with existing virtual try-on
models to achieve state-of-the-art results with styling control.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepAFRNet is a deep learning model using VGG16 backbone and cosine similarity to recognize altered fingerprints, achieving high accuracy (96.7-99.54%) on real altered samples with strict thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Altered fingerprint recognition is challenging but essential for security applications like border control and forensics, as adversaries can modify ridge patterns to evade detection.

Method: Uses VGG16 backbone for feature extraction and cosine similarity for comparing embeddings, evaluated on SOCOFing Real-Altered subset with three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard).

Result: Achieves accuracies of 96.7%, 98.76%, and 99.54% for Easy, Medium, and Hard levels with strict thresholds. Threshold sensitivity study shows accuracy degrades sharply (to 7.86-29.51%) when threshold is relaxed from 0.92 to 0.72.

Conclusion: DeepAFRNet addresses limitations of prior work by using real altered samples and reporting per-level metrics, indicating readiness for real-world deployments where security and recognition resilience are critical.

Abstract: Altered fingerprint recognition (AFR) is challenging for biometric
verification in applications such as border control, forensics, and fiscal
admission. Adversaries can deliberately modify ridge patterns to evade
detection, so robust recognition of altered prints is essential. We present
DeepAFRNet, a deep learning recognition model that matches and recognizes
distorted fingerprint samples. The approach uses a VGG16 backbone to extract
high-dimensional features and cosine similarity to compare embeddings. We
evaluate on the SOCOFing Real-Altered subset with three difficulty levels
(Easy, Medium, Hard). With strict thresholds, DeepAFRNet achieves accuracies of
96.7 percent, 98.76 percent, and 99.54 percent for the three levels. A
threshold-sensitivity study shows that relaxing the threshold from 0.92 to 0.72
sharply degrades accuracy to 7.86 percent, 27.05 percent, and 29.51 percent,
underscoring the importance of threshold selection in biometric systems. By
using real altered samples and reporting per-level metrics, DeepAFRNet
addresses limitations of prior work based on synthetic alterations or limited
verification protocols, and indicates readiness for real-world deployments
where both security and recognition resilience are critical.

Transformer into voxel representations to enhance bimanual robotic
manipulation. Specifically, we extract attention maps from DINOv2, a
self-supervised ViT model, and interpret them as pixel-level saliency scores
over RGB images. These maps are lifted into a 3D voxel grid, resulting in
voxel-level semantic cues that are incorporated into a behavior cloning policy.
When integrated into a state-of-the-art voxel-based policy, our
attention-guided featurization yields an average absolute improvement of 8.2%
and a relative gain of 21.9% across all tasks in the RLBench bimanual
benchmark.

*Xinyang Mu,Yuzhen Lu,Boyang Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Comparative benchmark analysis of 36 real-time object detectors (YOLO v8-v12 and RT-DETR v1-v2 families) for blueberry detection, evaluated on a new dataset and enhanced with semi-supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blueberry detection in natural environments is challenging due to variable lighting, occlusions, and motion blur. Deep learning detectors need large-scale datasets and optimal accuracy/speed/memory trade-offs for practical deployment.

Method: Evaluated 36 model variants on a curated dataset of 661 canopy images with 85,879 labeled instances. Applied Unbiased Mean Teacher-based semi-supervised learning on 1,035 unlabeled images for performance enhancement.

Result: YOLOv12m achieved 93.3% mAP@50, RT-DETRv2-X achieved 93.6% mAP@50. SSL improved accuracy by up to 2.9%, with RT-DETR-v2-X reaching 94.8% mAP@50. Mid-sized models offered best accuracy-speed balance.

Conclusion: RT-DETR-v2-X performed best overall after SSL enhancement. More SSL research needed for cross-domain unlabeled data. Dataset and software made publicly available to support further research.

Abstract: Blueberry detection in natural environments remains challenging due to
variable lighting, occlusions, and motion blur due to environmental factors and
imaging devices. Deep learning-based object detectors promise to address these
challenges, but they demand a large-scale, diverse dataset that captures the
real-world complexities. Moreover, deploying these models in practical
scenarios often requires the right accuracy/speed/memory trade-off in model
selection. This study presents a novel comparative benchmark analysis of
advanced real-time object detectors, including YOLO (You Only Look Once)
(v8-v12) and RT-DETR (Real-Time Detection Transformers) (v1-v2) families,
consisting of 36 model variants, evaluated on a newly curated dataset for
blueberry detection. This dataset comprises 661 canopy images collected with
smartphones during the 2022-2023 seasons, consisting of 85,879 labelled
instances (including 36,256 ripe and 49,623 unripe blueberries) across a wide
range of lighting conditions, occlusions, and fruit maturity stages. Among the
YOLO models, YOLOv12m achieved the best accuracy with a mAP@50 of 93.3%, while
RT-DETRv2-X obtained a mAP@50 of 93.6%, the highest among all the RT-DETR
variants. The inference time varied with the model scale and complexity, and
the mid-sized models appeared to offer a good accuracy-speed balance. To
further enhance detection performance, all the models were fine-tuned using
Unbiased Mean Teacher-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) on a separate set of
1,035 unlabeled images acquired by a ground-based machine vision platform in
2024. This resulted in accuracy gains ranging from -1.4% to 2.9%, with
RT-DETR-v2-X achieving the best mAP@50 of 94.8%. More in-depth research into
SSL is needed to better leverage cross-domain unlabeled data. Both the dataset
and software programs of this study are made publicly available to support
further research.

*Farbod Bigdeli,Mohsen Mohammadagha,Ali Bigdeli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight ROI augmentation strategy for mammography classification that probabilistically replaces full images with random ROI crops during training, showing modest performance gains without inference-time cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast cancer screening with mammography is crucial for early detection, but deep learning performance is limited by small datasets and low resolution. The paper aims to enhance mammography classification in constrained settings.

Method: Introduces ROI augmentation where full images are probabilistically replaced with random ROI crops from a precomputed bounding-box bank during training, with optional jitter. Evaluated on Mini-DDSM dataset using patient-level cross-validation.

Result: ROI augmentation (best parameters: p_roi=0.10, alpha=0.10) yields modest ROC-AUC gains with performance varying across folds, while PR-AUC remains flat to slightly lower. Training efficiency metrics show unchanged inference-time cost.

Conclusion: Simple, data-centric ROI strategies can enhance mammography classification without requiring additional labels or architectural modifications, demonstrating value in constrained settings.

Abstract: Breast cancer screening with mammography remains central to early detection
and mortality reduction. Deep learning has shown strong potential for
automating mammogram interpretation, yet limited-resolution datasets and small
sample sizes continue to restrict performance. We revisit the Mini-DDSM dataset
(9,684 images; 2,414 patients) and introduce a lightweight region-of-interest
(ROI) augmentation strategy. During training, full images are probabilistically
replaced with random ROI crops sampled from a precomputed, label-free
bounding-box bank, with optional jitter to increase variability. We evaluate
under strict patient-level cross-validation and report ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and
training-time efficiency metrics (throughput and GPU memory). Because ROI
augmentation is training-only, inference-time cost remains unchanged. On
Mini-DDSM, ROI augmentation (best: p_roi = 0.10, alpha = 0.10) yields modest
average ROC-AUC gains, with performance varying across folds; PR-AUC is flat to
slightly lower. These results demonstrate that simple, data-centric ROI
strategies can enhance mammography classification in constrained settings
without requiring additional labels or architectural modifications.

*Jing Wu,Zirui Wang,Iro Laina,Victor Adrian Prisacariu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using mirror reflections as auxiliary views to create a multi-view stereo setup from single images for 3D reconstruction, with applications to both static and dynamic scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mirror reflections are common in everyday environments and can provide stereo information within a single capture, allowing for simplified 3D reconstruction without complex multi-camera setups.

Method: Treat mirror reflections as auxiliary views, design a transformation to construct physically valid virtual cameras, use symmetric-aware loss for pose refinement, and extend to dynamic scenes with per-frame geometry recovery.

Result: The method enables robust 3D reconstruction from single images with mirrors, validated through extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic data using a custom Blender dataset.

Conclusion: Mirror reflections can effectively serve as virtual stereo views, simplifying the imaging process and enabling generalizable 3D reconstruction from single captures in both static and dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: Mirror reflections are common in everyday environments and can provide stereo
information within a single capture, as the real and reflected virtual views
are visible simultaneously. We exploit this property by treating the reflection
as an auxiliary view and designing a transformation that constructs a
physically valid virtual camera, allowing direct pixel-domain generation of the
virtual view while adhering to the real-world imaging process. This enables a
multi-view stereo setup from a single image, simplifying the imaging process,
making it compatible with powerful feed-forward reconstruction models for
generalizable and robust 3D reconstruction. To further exploit the geometric
symmetry introduced by mirrors, we propose a symmetric-aware loss to refine
pose estimation. Our framework also naturally extends to dynamic scenes, where
each frame contains a mirror reflection, enabling efficient per-frame geometry
recovery. For quantitative evaluation, we provide a fully customizable
synthetic dataset of 16 Blender scenes, each with ground-truth point clouds and
camera poses. Extensive experiments on real-world data and synthetic data are
conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our method.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods using overhead imagery miss important facade and access cues that determine habitability, while street-view imagery is sparse and difficult to align with parcels. There's a need for more accurate and interpretable occupancy assessment after disasters.

Method: A language-guided framework that links panoramic video to parcels, rectifies views to facades, and extracts interpretable attributes (entry blockage, temporary coverings, debris). Uses two decision strategies: a transparent one-stage rule and a two-stage design separating perception from conservative reasoning.

Result: Evaluated on post-Hurricane Helene surveys, the two-stage approach achieved precision of 0.927, recall of 0.781, and F-1 score of 0.848, outperforming the one-stage baseline (precision 0.943, recall 0.728, F-1 0.822). Intermediate attributes provide spatial diagnostics for error analysis.

Conclusion: FacadeTrack provides auditable, scalable occupancy assessments suitable for integration into geospatial and emergency-management workflows, enabling targeted quality control through interpretable intermediate attributes.

Abstract: Building-level occupancy after disasters is vital for triage, inspections,
utility re-energization, and equitable resource allocation. Overhead imagery
provides rapid coverage but often misses facade and access cues that determine
habitability, while street-view imagery captures those details but is sparse
and difficult to align with parcels. We present FacadeTrack, a street-level,
language-guided framework that links panoramic video to parcels, rectifies
views to facades, and elicits interpretable attributes (for example, entry
blockage, temporary coverings, localized debris) that drive two decision
strategies: a transparent one-stage rule and a two-stage design that separates
perception from conservative reasoning. Evaluated across two post-Hurricane
Helene surveys, the two-stage approach achieves a precision of 0.927, a recall
of 0.781, and an F-1 score of 0.848, compared with the one-stage baseline at a
precision of 0.943, a recall of 0.728, and an F-1 score of 0.822. Beyond
accuracy, intermediate attributes and spatial diagnostics reveal where and why
residual errors occur, enabling targeted quality control. The pipeline provides
auditable, scalable occupancy assessments suitable for integration into
geospatial and emergency-management workflows.

### [15] [Human Semantic Representations of Social Interactions from Moving Shapes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20673)
*Yiling Yun,Hongjing Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Humans use semantic representations alongside visual features to recognize social interactions in moving shapes. Semantic models, especially verb-based embeddings from descriptions, complement visual features in explaining human similarity judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what semantic representations humans employ to complement visual features when recognizing social interactions from simple moving shapes, bridging the gap between visual and abstract representations.

Method: Conducted two studies: Study 1 had participants label animations based on impressions; Study 2 measured representational geometry of 27 social interactions through human similarity judgments and compared with model predictions based on visual features, labels, and semantic embeddings from descriptions.

Result: Human responses were distributed in Study 1. In Study 2, semantic models provided complementary information to visual features, with verb-based embeddings from descriptions accounting for human similarity judgments the best.

Conclusion: Social perception in simple displays reflects the semantic structure of social interactions, suggesting that humans use semantic representations that bridge visual and abstract understanding of social interactions.

Abstract: Humans are social creatures who readily recognize various social interactions
from simple display of moving shapes. While previous research has often focused
on visual features, we examine what semantic representations that humans employ
to complement visual features. In Study 1, we directly asked human participants
to label the animations based on their impression of moving shapes. We found
that human responses were distributed. In Study 2, we measured the
representational geometry of 27 social interactions through human similarity
judgments and compared it with model predictions based on visual features,
labels, and semantic embeddings from animation descriptions. We found that
semantic models provided complementary information to visual features in
explaining human judgments. Among the semantic models, verb-based embeddings
extracted from descriptions account for human similarity judgments the best.
These results suggest that social perception in simple displays reflects the
semantic structure of social interactions, bridging visual and abstract
representations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EGS is a novel cross-view geo-localization framework that enhances cross-domain generalization using E(2)-Steerable CNN encoder for rotation/viewpoint robustness and a graph with virtual super-node for global-local consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address two key challenges in cross-view geo-localization: (1) achieving robustness under severe appearance variations from diverse UAV orientations and fields of view, and (2) establishing reliable correspondences that capture both global scene-level semantics and fine-grained local details.

Method: Propose EGS framework with E(2)-Steerable CNN encoder for stable feature extraction under rotation/viewpoint shifts, and construct a graph with virtual super-node that connects to all local nodes to aggregate global semantics and redistribute to local regions for global-local consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments on University-1652 and SUES-200 benchmarks demonstrate that EGS consistently achieves substantial performance gains and establishes a new state of the art in cross-domain CVGL.

Conclusion: EGS effectively addresses cross-domain generalization challenges in cross-view geo-localization through rotation-invariant feature extraction and global-local consistency modeling, achieving superior performance on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) aims to match images of the same location
captured from drastically different viewpoints. Despite recent progress,
existing methods still face two key challenges: (1) achieving robustness under
severe appearance variations induced by diverse UAV orientations and fields of
view, which hinders cross-domain generalization, and (2) establishing reliable
correspondences that capture both global scene-level semantics and fine-grained
local details. In this paper, we propose EGS, a novel CVGL framework designed
to enhance cross-domain generalization. Specifically, we introduce an
E(2)-Steerable CNN encoder to extract stable and reliable features under
rotation and viewpoint shifts. Furthermore, we construct a graph with a virtual
super-node that connects to all local nodes, enabling global semantics to be
aggregated and redistributed to local regions, thereby enforcing global-local
consistency. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200
benchmarks demonstrate that EGS consistently achieves substantial performance
gains and establishes a new state of the art in cross-domain CVGL.

### [17] [DENet: Dual-Path Edge Network with Global-Local Attention for Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20701)
*Jiayi Zuo,Songwei Pei,Qian Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a Dual-Path Edge Network for infrared small target detection that decouples edge enhancement and semantic modeling to address the conflict between capturing spatial details and extracting semantic context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared small targets lack distinctive features and blend into cluttered backgrounds, creating a fundamental challenge between capturing high-resolution spatial details for minute targets and extracting robust semantic context for larger targets, leading to feature misalignment.

Method: Uses a dual-path approach: (1) Bidirectional Interaction Module with Local and Global Self-Attention for multi-scale feature dependencies, and (2) Multi-Edge Refiner with cascaded Taylor finite difference operators and attention-driven gating for precise edge localization.

Result: The method provides precise infrared small target detection and localization by effectively combining structural semantics and edge refinement while suppressing noise.

Conclusion: The proposed Dual-Path Edge Network offers a promising solution that addresses the inherent conflict in infrared small target detection through complementary processing paths for edge enhancement and semantic modeling.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection is crucial for remote sensing applications
like disaster warning and maritime surveillance. However, due to the lack of
distinctive texture and morphological features, infrared small targets are
highly susceptible to blending into cluttered and noisy backgrounds. A
fundamental challenge in designing deep models for this task lies in the
inherent conflict between capturing high-resolution spatial details for minute
targets and extracting robust semantic context for larger targets, often
leading to feature misalignment and suboptimal performance. Existing methods
often rely on fixed gradient operators or simplistic attention mechanisms,
which are inadequate for accurately extracting target edges under low contrast
and high noise. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Path Edge Network that
explicitly addresses this challenge by decoupling edge enhancement and semantic
modeling into two complementary processing paths. The first path employs a
Bidirectional Interaction Module, which uses both Local Self-Attention and
Global Self-Attention to capture multi-scale local and global feature
dependencies. The global attention mechanism, based on a Transformer
architecture, integrates long-range semantic relationships and contextual
information, ensuring robust scene understanding. The second path introduces
the Multi-Edge Refiner, which enhances fine-grained edge details using cascaded
Taylor finite difference operators at multiple scales. This mathematical
approach, along with an attention-driven gating mechanism, enables precise edge
localization and feature enhancement for targets of varying sizes, while
effectively suppressing noise. Our method provides a promising solution for
precise infrared small target detection and localization, combining structural
semantics and edge refinement in a unified framework.

*Ruixu Zhang,Yuran Wang,Xinyi Hu,Chaoyu Mai,Wenxuan Liu,Danni Xu,Xian Zhong,Zheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces group intention forecasting (GIF) as a novel task to predict when collective intentions will emerge from individual actions, presents the SHOT dataset for basketball scenarios, and proposes the GIFT framework for modeling group dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional intention recognition focuses on individual intentions but overlooks the complexities of collective intentions that emerge through group interactions and shared goals.

Method: The authors propose GIFT (Group Intention ForecasTer), a framework that extracts fine-grained individual features and models evolving group dynamics to forecast intention emergence. They also introduce SHOT, a large-scale basketball dataset with multi-view video clips and individual attribute annotations.

Result: Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of both SHOT dataset and GIFT framework, establishing a strong foundation for future research in group intention forecasting.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the gap in collective intention recognition by introducing GIF as a novel task, providing a comprehensive dataset, and demonstrating an effective framework for forecasting group intention emergence.

Abstract: Intention recognition has traditionally focused on individual intentions,
overlooking the complexities of collective intentions in group settings. To
address this limitation, we introduce the concept of group intention, which
represents shared goals emerging through the actions of multiple individuals,
and Group Intention Forecasting (GIF), a novel task that forecasts when group
intentions will occur by analyzing individual actions and interactions before
the collective goal becomes apparent. To investigate GIF in a specific
scenario, we propose SHOT, the first large-scale dataset for GIF, consisting of
1,979 basketball video clips captured from 5 camera views and annotated with 6
types of individual attributes. SHOT is designed with 3 key characteristics:
multi-individual information, multi-view adaptability, and multi-level
intention, making it well-suited for studying emerging group intentions.
Furthermore, we introduce GIFT (Group Intention ForecasTer), a framework that
extracts fine-grained individual features and models evolving group dynamics to
forecast intention emergence. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of
SHOT and GIFT, establishing a strong foundation for future research in group
intention forecasting. The dataset is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Neptune-X is a data-centric generative-selection framework that addresses maritime object detection challenges by generating diverse synthetic maritime scenes and intelligently selecting task-relevant samples to improve detection accuracy in underrepresented scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maritime object detection faces two key challenges: scarcity of annotated maritime data and poor generalization across various maritime attributes (object category, viewpoint, location, imaging environment), particularly in underrepresented scenarios like open-sea environments.

Method: Proposes Neptune-X framework with two components: (1) X-to-Maritime multi-modality-conditioned generative model with Bidirectional Object-Water Attention module for realistic maritime scene synthesis, and (2) Attribute-correlated Active Sampling for dynamic selection of task-relevant synthetic samples. Also constructs Maritime Generation Dataset for benchmarking.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the approach sets new benchmarks in maritime scene synthesis and significantly improves detection accuracy, particularly in challenging and previously underrepresented settings.

Conclusion: Neptune-X effectively addresses maritime object detection limitations through synthetic data generation and intelligent sample selection, achieving superior performance especially in underrepresented maritime scenarios.

Abstract: Maritime object detection is essential for navigation safety, surveillance,
and autonomous operations, yet constrained by two key challenges: the scarcity
of annotated maritime data and poor generalization across various maritime
attributes (e.g., object category, viewpoint, location, and imaging
environment). % In particular, models trained on existing datasets often
underperform in underrepresented scenarios such as open-sea environments. To
address these challenges, we propose Neptune-X, a data-centric
generative-selection framework that enhances training effectiveness by
leveraging synthetic data generation with task-aware sample selection. From the
generation perspective, we develop X-to-Maritime, a multi-modality-conditioned
generative model that synthesizes diverse and realistic maritime scenes. A key
component is the Bidirectional Object-Water Attention module, which captures
boundary interactions between objects and their aquatic surroundings to improve
visual fidelity. To further improve downstream tasking performance, we propose
Attribute-correlated Active Sampling, which dynamically selects synthetic
samples based on their task relevance. To support robust benchmarking, we
construct the Maritime Generation Dataset, the first dataset tailored for
generative maritime learning, encompassing a wide range of semantic conditions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark in
maritime scene synthesis, significantly improving detection accuracy,
particularly in challenging and previously underrepresented settings.The code

*Sofia McLeod,Chee-Kheng Chng,Matthew Rodda,Tat-Jun Chin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STELLA is the first end-to-end Crater-Based Navigation pipeline for long-duration lunar mapping missions, achieving metre-level position and sub-degree attitude accuracy across varied conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Crater-Based Navigation methods were designed for short-duration landing missions with nadir imagery, but lunar mapping missions involve sparse, oblique imagery under varying illumination over year-long campaigns, requiring new approaches.

Method: STELLA combines Mask R-CNN-based crater detection, descriptor-less crater identification, robust perspective-n-crater pose solver, and batch orbit determination back-end. Tested on CRESENT-365 dataset simulating year-long lunar mapping.

Result: STELLA maintains metre-level position accuracy and sub-degree attitude accuracy on average across wide ranges of viewing angles, illumination conditions, and lunar latitudes.

Conclusion: This is the first comprehensive assessment of CBN in true lunar mapping settings, providing operational conditions for future missions.

Abstract: Crater-Based Navigation (CBN) uses the ubiquitous impact craters of the Moon
observed on images as natural landmarks to determine the six degrees of freedom
pose of a spacecraft. To date, CBN has primarily been studied in the context of
powered descent and landing. These missions are typically short in duration,
with high-frequency imagery captured from a nadir viewpoint over well-lit
terrain. In contrast, lunar mapping missions involve sparse, oblique imagery
acquired under varying illumination conditions over potentially year-long
campaigns, posing significantly greater challenges for pose estimation. We
bridge this gap with STELLA - the first end-to-end CBN pipeline for
long-duration lunar mapping. STELLA combines a Mask R-CNN-based crater
detector, a descriptor-less crater identification module, a robust
perspective-n-crater pose solver, and a batch orbit determination back-end. To
rigorously test STELLA, we introduce CRESENT-365 - the first public dataset
that emulates a year-long lunar mapping mission. Each of its 15,283 images is
rendered from high-resolution digital elevation models with SPICE-derived Sun
angles and Moon motion, delivering realistic global coverage, illumination
cycles, and viewing geometries. Experiments on CRESENT+ and CRESENT-365 show
that STELLA maintains metre-level position accuracy and sub-degree attitude
accuracy on average across wide ranges of viewing angles, illumination
conditions, and lunar latitudes. These results constitute the first
comprehensive assessment of CBN in a true lunar mapping setting and inform
operational conditions that should be considered for future missions.

### [21] [Seeing Through Words, Speaking Through Pixels: Deep Representational Alignment Between Vision and Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20751)
*Zoe Wanying He,Sean Trott,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep vision-only and language-only models trained on disjoint modalities project inputs into a partially aligned representational space, with alignment peaking in mid-to-late layers and reflecting semantic rather than appearance-based convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically investigate where alignment emerges in unimodal networks, what cues support it, whether it captures human preferences in many-to-many image-text scenarios, and how exemplar aggregation affects alignment.

Method: Forced-choice "Pick-a-Pic" task comparing human preferences with model embeddings, analysis of layer-wise alignment patterns, and testing robustness to semantic vs. appearance changes.

Result: Alignment peaks in mid-to-late layers, is robust to appearance changes but collapses with semantic alterations, mirrors human preferences bidirectionally, and strengthens with exemplar aggregation.

Conclusion: Unimodal networks converge on a shared semantic code that aligns with human judgments and is enhanced by exemplar aggregation, demonstrating true semantic alignment rather than superficial feature matching.

Abstract: Recent studies show that deep vision-only and language-only models--trained
on disjoint modalities--nonetheless project their inputs into a partially
aligned representational space. Yet we still lack a clear picture of where in
each network this convergence emerges, what visual or linguistic cues support
it, whether it captures human preferences in many-to-many image-text scenarios,
and how aggregating exemplars of the same concept affects alignment. Here, we
systematically investigate these questions. We find that alignment peaks in
mid-to-late layers of both model types, reflecting a shift from
modality-specific to conceptually shared representations. This alignment is
robust to appearance-only changes but collapses when semantics are altered
(e.g., object removal or word-order scrambling), highlighting that the shared
code is truly semantic. Moving beyond the one-to-one image-caption paradigm, a
forced-choice "Pick-a-Pic" task shows that human preferences for image-caption
matches are mirrored in the embedding spaces across all vision-language model
pairs. This pattern holds bidirectionally when multiple captions correspond to
a single image, demonstrating that models capture fine-grained semantic
distinctions akin to human judgments. Surprisingly, averaging embeddings across
exemplars amplifies alignment rather than blurring detail. Together, our
results demonstrate that unimodal networks converge on a shared semantic code
that aligns with human judgments and strengthens with exemplar aggregation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeInsert is a training-free framework that enables geometrically controlled and style-consistent object insertion into images by leveraging 3D generation models and diffusion adapters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image editing methods lack geometric control over inserted objects (confined to 2D space) and struggle with style consistency between objects and backgrounds, while requiring extensive training.

Method: Convert 2D objects to 3D using existing 3D generation models, perform interactive editing at the 3D level, then re-render to 2D from specified views. Combine geometric control with style/content control through diffusion adapters.

Result: The framework produces geometrically controlled and style-consistent edited images without requiring training.

Conclusion: FreeInsert successfully addresses limitations in personalized image composition by introducing 3D geometric control and ensuring style consistency through a training-free approach.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have made significant progress in image
generation, allowing for effortless customized generation. However, existing
image editing methods still face certain limitations when dealing with
personalized image composition tasks. First, there is the issue of lack of
geometric control over the inserted objects. Current methods are confined to 2D
space and typically rely on textual instructions, making it challenging to
maintain precise geometric control over the objects. Second, there is the
challenge of style consistency. Existing methods often overlook the style
consistency between the inserted object and the background, resulting in a lack
of realism. In addition, the challenge of inserting objects into images without
extensive training remains significant. To address these issues, we propose
\textit{FreeInsert}, a novel training-free framework that customizes object
insertion into arbitrary scenes by leveraging 3D geometric information.
Benefiting from the advances in existing 3D generation models, we first convert
the 2D object into 3D, perform interactive editing at the 3D level, and then
re-render it into a 2D image from a specified view. This process introduces
geometric controls such as shape or view. The rendered image, serving as
geometric control, is combined with style and content control achieved through
diffusion adapters, ultimately producing geometrically controlled,
style-consistent edited images via the diffusion model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CustomEnhancer is a zero-shot enhancement framework that improves text-to-image diffusion models for human photo synthesis by combining face swapping, triple-flow fusion, and a novel ResInversion method to achieve better scene diversity, identity fidelity, and training-free control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image diffusion models for human photo synthesis face issues with degraded scenes, insufficient control, and suboptimal perceptual identity, which limits their practical applications.

Method: The framework uses face swapping techniques and pretrained diffusion models to obtain additional representations. It employs a triple-flow fused PerGeneration approach that combines two counter-directional latent spaces to manipulate personalized models, and introduces ResInversion for efficient noise rectification via pre-diffusion.

Result: CustomEnhancer achieves state-of-the-art results in scene diversity, identity fidelity, and training-free controls. ResInversion reduces inversion time by 129 times compared to null-text inversion (NTI).

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enhances existing identity customization models with improved performance and efficiency, offering a comprehensive solution for personalized human photo generation.

Abstract: Recently remarkable progress has been made in synthesizing realistic human
photos using text-to-image diffusion models. However, current approaches face
degraded scenes, insufficient control, and suboptimal perceptual identity. We
introduce CustomEnhancer, a novel framework to augment existing identity
customization models. CustomEnhancer is a zero-shot enhancement pipeline that
leverages face swapping techniques, pretrained diffusion model, to obtain
additional representations in a zeroshot manner for encoding into personalized
models. Through our proposed triple-flow fused PerGeneration approach, which
identifies and combines two compatible counter-directional latent spaces to
manipulate a pivotal space of personalized model, we unify the generation and
reconstruction processes, realizing generation from three flows. Our pipeline
also enables comprehensive training-free control over the generation process of
personalized models, offering precise controlled personalization for them and
eliminating the need for controller retraining for per-model. Besides, to
address the high time complexity of null-text inversion (NTI), we introduce
ResInversion, a novel inversion method that performs noise rectification via a
pre-diffusion mechanism, reducing the inversion time by 129 times. Experiments
demonstrate that CustomEnhancer reach SOTA results at scene diversity, identity
fidelity, training-free controls, while also showing the efficiency of our
ResInversion over NTI. The code will be made publicly available upon paper
acceptance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the growing use of neural network-based computer vision applications, there's a need for a consolidated platform to evaluate compression methods that maintain task accuracy while efficiently compressing input data for various vision tasks.

Method: The platform provides a comprehensive evaluation framework where coding tools can compete, incorporating standard codecs to examine compression gain in terms of bit-rate versus task accuracy across multiple datasets.

### [25] [Dual-supervised Asymmetric Co-training for Semi-supervised Medical Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20785)
*Jincai Song,Haipeng Chen,Jun Qin,Na Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a dual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) framework for cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization (CD-SSDG) in medical image segmentation, addressing domain shifts between labeled/unlabeled training data and training/testing sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional SSDG methods assume labeled and unlabeled data are available for each source domain, but in practice, domain shifts occur between labeled and unlabeled training data, leading to inaccurate pseudolabels and sub-optimal performance.

Method: DAC framework builds on co-training with two sub-models providing cross pseudo supervision, integrating feature-level supervision and asymmetric auxiliary self-supervised tasks to address inaccurate pseudo supervision and enhance domain-invariant feature learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on Fundus, Polyp, and SCGM medical image datasets demonstrate the robust generalizability of the proposed DAC framework.

Conclusion: The DAC framework effectively handles the challenging CD-SSDG scenario where domain shifts exist between labeled/unlabeled training data and training/testing sets, outperforming existing SSDG methods.

Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) in medical image segmentation
offers a promising solution for generalizing to unseen domains during testing,
addressing domain shift challenges and minimizing annotation costs. However,
conventional SSDG methods assume labeled and unlabeled data are available for
each source domain in the training set, a condition that is not always met in
practice. The coexistence of limited annotation and domain shift in the
training set is a prevalent issue. Thus, this paper explores a more practical
and challenging scenario, cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization
(CD-SSDG), where domain shifts occur between labeled and unlabeled training
data, in addition to shifts between training and testing sets. Existing SSDG
methods exhibit sub-optimal performance under such domain shifts because of
inaccurate pseudolabels. To address this issue, we propose a novel
dual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) framework tailored for CD-SSDG.
Building upon the co-training paradigm with two sub-models offering cross
pseudo supervision, our DAC framework integrates extra feature-level
supervision and asymmetric auxiliary tasks for each sub-model. This
feature-level supervision serves to address inaccurate pseudo supervision
caused by domain shifts between labeled and unlabeled data, utilizing
complementary supervision from the rich feature space. Additionally, two
distinct auxiliary self-supervised tasks are integrated into each sub-model to
enhance domain-invariant discriminative feature learning and prevent model
collapse. Extensive experiments on real-world medical image segmentation
datasets, i.e., Fundus, Polyp, and SCGM, demonstrate the robust
generalizability of the proposed DAC framework.

*Shihua Huang,Yongjie Hou,Longfei Liu,Xuanlong Yu,Xi Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEIMv2 extends the DEIM framework with DINOv3 features, creating a family of object detection models spanning eight sizes from X to Atto. It achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior parameter efficiency across GPU, edge, and mobile deployments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build upon the success of DEIM's Dense O2O and MAL framework, which significantly outperforms YOLO series, by incorporating DINOv3 features to create a more efficient and scalable object detection system that covers diverse deployment scenarios from high-performance GPUs to resource-constrained mobile devices.

Method: For larger models (X, L, M, S): use DINOv3-pretrained/distilled backbones with Spatial Tuning Adapter (STA) to convert single-scale output to multi-scale features. For ultra-lightweight models (Nano, Pico, Femto, Atto): employ HGNetv2 with depth/width pruning, simplified decoder, and upgraded Dense O2O.

Result: DEIMv2-X achieves 57.8 AP with 50.3M parameters (surpassing 56.5 AP models requiring >60M parameters). DEIMv2-S is first sub-10M model (9.71M) to exceed 50 AP (50.9 AP). DEIMv2-Pico (1.5M parameters) delivers 38.5 AP, matching YOLOv10-Nano (2.3M) with 50% fewer parameters.

Conclusion: DEIMv2 establishes new state-of-the-art results with superior performance-cost trade-off across diverse scenarios, demonstrating that efficient object detection can be achieved through unified design principles and strategic feature integration from advanced vision models like DINOv3.

Abstract: Benefiting from the simplicity and effectiveness of Dense O2O and MAL, DEIM
has become the mainstream training framework for real-time DETRs, significantly
outperforming the YOLO series. In this work, we extend it with DINOv3 features,
resulting in DEIMv2. DEIMv2 spans eight model sizes from X to Atto, covering
GPU, edge, and mobile deployment. For the X, L, M, and S variants, we adopt
DINOv3-pretrained or distilled backbones and introduce a Spatial Tuning Adapter
(STA), which efficiently converts DINOv3's single-scale output into multi-scale
features and complements strong semantics with fine-grained details to enhance
detection. For ultra-lightweight models (Nano, Pico, Femto, and Atto), we
employ HGNetv2 with depth and width pruning to meet strict resource budgets.
Together with a simplified decoder and an upgraded Dense O2O, this unified
design enables DEIMv2 to achieve a superior performance-cost trade-off across
diverse scenarios, establishing new state-of-the-art results. Notably, our
largest model, DEIMv2-X, achieves 57.8 AP with only 50.3 million parameters,
surpassing prior X-scale models that require over 60 million parameters for
just 56.5 AP. On the compact side, DEIMv2-S is the first sub-10 million model
(9.71 million) to exceed the 50 AP milestone on COCO, reaching 50.9 AP. Even
the ultra-lightweight DEIMv2-Pico, with just 1.5 million parameters, delivers
38.5 AP, matching YOLOv10-Nano (2.3 million) with around 50 percent fewer

*Ved Umrajkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAC-LoRA is a novel framework that integrates adversarial training into Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA, using a dynamic curriculum of progressively challenging attacks to enhance robustness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) against adversarial attacks while maintaining clean accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs are critical for safety-sensitive applications like autonomous driving and medical diagnosis, but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. CLIP, as the backbone for many VLMs, is a high-value target whose vulnerabilities can cascade across the multimodal AI ecosystem.

Method: Proposes DAC-LoRA framework that integrates adversarial training into PEFT using an intelligent curriculum of progressively challenging attacks. The method is guided by the First-Order Stationary Condition (FOSC) and a TRADES-inspired loss, making it applicable to any iterative attack method.

Result: Achieves substantial improvements in adversarial robustness without significantly compromising clean accuracy. The framework is effective, lightweight, and broadly applicable.

Conclusion: DAC-LoRA can be easily integrated into standard PEFT pipelines to significantly enhance robustness of VLMs, providing a practical solution for securing safety-critical AI systems.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are foundational to critical applications like
autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and content moderation. While
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA enable their efficient
adaptation to specialized tasks, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that can compromise safety-critical decisions. CLIP, the backbone for
numerous downstream VLMs, is a high-value target whose vulnerabilities can
cascade across the multimodal AI ecosystem. We propose Dynamic Adversarial
Curriculum DAC-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates adversarial training
into PEFT. The core principle of our method i.e. an intelligent curriculum of
progressively challenging attack, is general and can potentially be applied to
any iterative attack method. Guided by the First-Order Stationary Condition
(FOSC) and a TRADES-inspired loss, DAC-LoRA achieves substantial improvements
in adversarial robustness without significantly compromising clean accuracy.
Our work presents an effective, lightweight, and broadly applicable method to
demonstrate that the DAC-LoRA framework can be easily integrated into a
standard PEFT pipeline to significantly enhance robustness.

*Jianhan Wu,Xiaoyang Qu,Zhangcheng Huang,Jianzong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedDSPG is a novel federated domain generalization method that generates domain-specific soft prompts from a generative perspective, outperforming existing baselines by better handling unknown domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated domain generalization methods based on prompt learning have limited diversity and ignore information from unknown domains, which poses challenges for downstream-task adaptation in federated learning settings with domain shifts among clients.

Method: The proposed FedDSPG introduces domain-specific soft prompts (DSPs) for each domain and integrates content and domain knowledge into a generative model during training. During inference, the generator produces DSPs for unseen target domains to guide downstream tasks.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations across several public datasets confirm that FedDSPG outperforms existing strong baselines in federated domain generalization, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: The generative approach for handling federated domain generalization tasks with domain-specific soft prompts generation proves to be an effective method that addresses the limitations of existing prompt learning techniques in federated settings.

Abstract: Prompt learning has become an efficient paradigm for adapting CLIP to
downstream tasks. Compared with traditional fine-tuning, prompt learning
optimizes a few parameters yet yields highly competitive results, especially
appealing in federated learning for computational efficiency. engendering
domain shift among clients and posing a formidable challenge for
downstream-task adaptation. Existing federated domain generalization (FDG)
methods based on prompt learning typically learn soft prompts from training
samples, replacing manually designed prompts to enhance the generalization
ability of federated models. However, these learned prompts exhibit limited
diversity and tend to ignore information from unknown domains. We propose a
novel and effective method from a generative perspective for handling FDG
tasks, namely federated domain generalization with domain-specific soft prompts
generation (FedDSPG). Specifically, during training, we introduce
domain-specific soft prompts (DSPs) for each domain and integrate content and
domain knowledge into the generative model among clients. In the inference
phase, the generator is utilized to obtain DSPs for unseen target domains, thus
guiding downstream tasks in unknown domains. Comprehensive evaluations across
several public datasets confirm that our method outperforms existing strong
baselines in FDG, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Low back pain affects millions worldwide, driving the need for robust
diagnostic models that can jointly analyze complex medical images and
accompanying text reports. We present LumbarCLIP, a novel multimodal framework
that leverages contrastive language-image pretraining to align lumbar spine MRI
scans with corresponding radiological descriptions. Built upon a curated
dataset containing axial MRI views paired with expert-written reports,
LumbarCLIP integrates vision encoders (ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, Swin
Transformer) with a BERT-based text encoder to extract dense representations.
These are projected into a shared embedding space via learnable projection
heads, configurable as linear or non-linear, and normalized to facilitate
stable contrastive training using a soft CLIP loss. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on downstream classification, reaching up to
95.00% accuracy and 94.75% F1-score on the test set, despite inherent class
imbalance. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate that linear projection heads
yield more effective cross-modal alignment than non-linear variants. LumbarCLIP
offers a promising foundation for automated musculoskeletal diagnosis and

*Yuxin Cao,Wei Song,Jingling Xue,Jin Song Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoisonVID is the first black-box poisoning attack that compromises prompt-guided sampling in VideoLLMs through a closed-loop optimization strategy, achieving 82-99% attack success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While vulnerabilities have been identified in earlier frame sampling strategies for VideoLLMs, the safety of the most recent prompt-guided sampling approach remains unexplored.

Method: PoisonVID uses a closed-loop optimization strategy that iteratively optimizes a universal perturbation to suppress harmful frame relevance scores, guided by a depiction set constructed from paraphrased harmful descriptions using a shadow VideoLLM and GPT-4o-mini.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation on three prompt-guided sampling strategies across three advanced VideoLLMs shows PoisonVID achieves 82% - 99% attack success rate.

Conclusion: The high attack success rate highlights the importance of developing future advanced sampling strategies for VideoLLMs to address security vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
understanding videos, supporting tasks such as summarization, captioning, and
question answering. Their performance has been driven by advances in frame
sampling, progressing from uniform-based to semantic-similarity-based and, most
recently, prompt-guided strategies. While vulnerabilities have been identified
in earlier sampling strategies, the safety of prompt-guided sampling remains
unexplored. We close this gap by presenting PoisonVID, the first black-box
poisoning attack that undermines prompt-guided sampling in VideoLLMs. PoisonVID
compromises the underlying prompt-guided sampling mechanism through a
closed-loop optimization strategy that iteratively optimizes a universal
perturbation to suppress harmful frame relevance scores, guided by a depiction
set constructed from paraphrased harmful descriptions leveraging a shadow
VideoLLM and a lightweight language model, i.e., GPT-4o-mini. Comprehensively
evaluated on three prompt-guided sampling strategies and across three advanced
VideoLLMs, PoisonVID achieves 82% - 99% attack success rate, highlighting the
importance of developing future advanced sampling strategies for VideoLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GoR is a novel learnable regularization method that adaptively balances task-specific and knowledge distillation losses in quantization-aware training using only two trainable parameters for dynamic loss weighting, improving performance of small quantized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QAT-KD methods struggle to balance task-specific and distillation losses due to heterogeneous gradient magnitudes, especially under low-bit quantization, leading to performance degradation.

Method: Proposes Game of Regularizer (GoR) with two trainable parameters for dynamic loss weighting, and introduces QAT-EKD-GoR ensemble distillation framework using multiple heterogeneous teacher models.

Result: GoR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art QAT-KD methods on image classification, object detection, and LLM compression, delivering faster inference on low-power edge devices while maintaining full-precision accuracy.

Conclusion: GoR provides a robust solution for real-world deployment, with EKD-GoR capable of outperforming full-precision models under optimal conditions.

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) combined with knowledge distillation (KD)
is a promising strategy for compressing Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for
deployment on resource-constrained hardware. However, existing QAT-KD methods
often struggle to balance task-specific (TS) and distillation losses due to
heterogeneous gradient magnitudes, especially under low-bit quantization. We
propose Game of Regularizer (GoR), a novel learnable regularization method that
adaptively balances TS and KD objectives using only two trainable parameters
for dynamic loss weighting. GoR reduces conflict between supervision signals,
improves convergence, and boosts the performance of small quantized models
(SQMs). Experiments on image classification, object detection (OD), and large
language model (LLM) compression show that GoR consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art QAT-KD methods. On low-power edge devices, it delivers faster
inference while maintaining full-precision accuracy. We also introduce
QAT-EKD-GoR, an ensemble distillation framework that uses multiple
heterogeneous teacher models. Under optimal conditions, the proposed EKD-GoR
can outperform full-precision models, providing a robust solution for
real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The LifeCLEF 2017 plant identification challenge compared using large noisy web-collected datasets vs. smaller expert-verified datasets for automated plant identification across 10,000 species with 1.1M images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether large-scale noisy training data from web sources can compete with smaller, expert-curated datasets for plant identification, addressing the challenge that most plant species lack sufficient expert-verified images.

Method: Used two training strategies: (1) large noisy dataset collected from web sources (blogs, image hosting sites, plant retailers) and (2) smaller trusted dataset verified by experts. Test dataset was created from Pl@ntNet mobile application data as an independent third source.

Result: The challenge assessed the performance of both training approaches on a continental-scale plant identification task covering 10,000 species mainly from Europe and North America.

Conclusion: The study provides comparative analysis of web-sourced vs. expert-curated training data strategies for large-scale automated plant identification systems.

Abstract: The 2017-th edition of the LifeCLEF plant identification challenge is an
important milestone towards automated plant identification systems working at
the scale of continental floras with 10.000 plant species living mainly in
Europe and North America illustrated by a total of 1.1M images. Nowadays, such
ambitious systems are enabled thanks to the conjunction of the dazzling recent
progress in image classification with deep learning and several outstanding
international initiatives, such as the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), aggregating
the visual knowledge on plant species coming from the main national botany
institutes. However, despite all these efforts the majority of the plant
species still remain without pictures or are poorly illustrated. Outside the
institutional channels, a much larger number of plant pictures are available
and spread on the web through botanist blogs, plant lovers web-pages, image
hosting websites and on-line plant retailers. The LifeCLEF 2017 plant challenge
presented in this paper aimed at evaluating to what extent a large noisy
training dataset collected through the web and containing a lot of labelling
errors can compete with a smaller but trusted training dataset checked by
experts. To fairly compare both training strategies, the test dataset was
created from a third data source, i.e. the Pl@ntNet mobile application that
collects millions of plant image queries all over the world. This paper
presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge,
summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating research
groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

*Xiaonan Hu,Xuebing Li,Jinyu Xu,Abdulkadir Duran Adan,Letian Zhou,Xuhui Zhu,Yanan Li,Wei Guo,Shouyang Liu,Wenzhong Liu,Hao Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TasselNetV4 is a new plant counting model that shifts from species-specific to cross-species counting by combining local counting with extract-and-match paradigms, achieving superior performance and efficiency across diverse plant species.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional plant counting models are species-dependent, but plant biodiversity and constant breeding of new cultivars make it impossible to build models for all species. Current class-agnostic counting models perform poorly on plants due to their dynamic, non-rigid nature.

Method: TasselNetV4 builds on TasselNet's local counting approach and marries it with extract-and-match paradigm from class-agnostic counting. It uses a plain vision transformer with novel multi-branch box-aware local counters to enhance cross-scale robustness.

Result: Extensive experiments on PAC-105 and PAC-Somalia datasets show TasselNetV4 achieves superior counting performance and high efficiency compared to state-of-the-art class-agnostic counting models.

Conclusion: TasselNetV4 emerges as a vision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant counting, addressing the limitations of species-specific models in handling plant biodiversity.

Abstract: Accurate plant counting provides valuable information for agriculture such as
crop yield prediction, plant density assessment, and phenotype quantification.
Vision-based approaches are currently the mainstream solution. Prior art
typically uses a detection or a regression model to count a specific plant.
However, plants have biodiversity, and new cultivars are increasingly bred each
year. It is almost impossible to exhaust and build all species-dependent
counting models. Inspired by class-agnostic counting (CAC) in computer vision,
we argue that it is time to rethink the problem formulation of plant counting,
from what plants to count to how to count plants. In contrast to most daily
objects with spatial and temporal invariance, plants are dynamic, changing with
time and space. Their non-rigid structure often leads to worse performance than
counting rigid instances like heads and cars such that current CAC and
open-world detection models are suboptimal to count plants. In this work, we
inherit the vein of the TasselNet plant counting model and introduce a new
extension, TasselNetV4, shifting from species-specific counting to
cross-species counting. TasselNetV4 marries the local counting idea of
TasselNet with the extract-and-match paradigm in CAC. It builds upon a plain
vision transformer and incorporates novel multi-branch box-aware local counters
used to enhance cross-scale robustness. Two challenging datasets, PAC-105 and
PAC-Somalia, are harvested. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art CAC
models show that TasselNetV4 achieves not only superior counting performance
but also high efficiency.Our results indicate that TasselNetV4 emerges to be a
vision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant
counting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel semi-supervised model for retinal OCT segmentation that introduces a differentiable biomarker topology engine to enforce anatomically correct segmentation of layers and lesions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semi-supervised learning methods for retinal segmentation often produce anatomically implausible results, fail to model layer-lesion interactions effectively, and lack guarantees on topological correctness.

Method: Proposed a semi-supervised model with a fully differentiable biomarker topology engine that enables joint learning with bidirectional influence between layers and lesions, using disentangled representations separating spatial and style factors.

Result: The model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on public and internal OCT datasets for both lesion and layer segmentation, demonstrating generalization to pathological cases using partially annotated data.

Conclusion: The approach shows the potential of using anatomical constraints in semi-supervised learning for accurate, robust, and trustworthy retinal biomarker segmentation.

Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is widely used for diagnosing and
monitoring retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
The segmentation of biomarkers such as layers and lesions is essential for
patient diagnosis and follow-up. Recently, semi-supervised learning has shown
promise in improving retinal segmentation performance. However, existing
methods often produce anatomically implausible segmentations, fail to
effectively model layer-lesion interactions, and lack guarantees on topological
correctness.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel semi-supervised model that
introduces a fully differentiable biomarker topology engine to enforce
anatomically correct segmentation of lesions and layers. This enables joint
learning with bidirectional influence between layers and lesions, leveraging
unlabeled and diverse partially labeled datasets. Our model learns a
disentangled representation, separating spatial and style factors. This
approach enables more realistic layer segmentations and improves lesion
segmentation, while strictly enforcing lesion location in their anatomically
plausible positions relative to the segmented layers.
  We evaluate the proposed model on public and internal datasets of OCT scans
and show that it outperforms the current state-of-the-art in both lesion and
layer segmentation, while demonstrating the ability to generalize layer
segmentation to pathological cases using partially annotated training data. Our
results demonstrate the potential of using anatomical constraints in
semi-supervised learning for accurate, robust, and trustworthy retinal
biomarker segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create realistic biodiversity monitoring scenarios by testing plant identification systems at large scale with real-world conditions, including the challenge of rejecting unknown species not present in training data.

Method: Conducted an open-set recognition problem where systems had to classify known plant species while automatically rejecting false positives from unknown categories, using a dataset built through participatory sensing with tens of thousands of contributors.

Result: The challenge successfully evaluated various approaches for large-scale plant identification with unknown category rejection, providing insights into robust biodiversity monitoring systems.

Conclusion: The LifeCLEF 2016 edition advanced plant identification research by addressing the practical challenge of open-set recognition, demonstrating the viability of large-scale participatory sensing for biodiversity monitoring.

Abstract: The LifeCLEF plant identification challenge aims at evaluating plant
identification methods and systems at a very large scale, close to the
conditions of a real-world biodiversity monitoring scenario. The 2016-th
edition was actually conducted on a set of more than 110K images illustrating
1000 plant species living in West Europe, built through a large-scale
participatory sensing platform initiated in 2011 and which now involves tens of
thousands of contributors. The main novelty over the previous years is that the
identification task was evaluated as an open-set recognition problem, i.e. a
problem in which the recognition system has to be robust to unknown and never
seen categories. Beyond the brute-force classification across the known classes
of the training set, the big challenge was thus to automatically reject the
false positive classification hits that are caused by the unknown classes. This
overview presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the
challenge, summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating
research groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCRA-VQA is a novel method that improves Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering by using summarized and reordered captions to enhance LLM reasoning without expensive training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods using LLMs for KB-VQA suffer from noisy image captions and LLMs' limited comprehension of VQA tasks, which restricts their reasoning capabilities.

Method: Proposes SCRA-VQA which converts images to captions using a pre-trained visual language model, then generates contextual examples while summarizing and reordering captions to exclude irrelevant information.

Result: Achieves accuracies of 38.8% on OK-VQA and 34.6% on A-OKVQA using a 6.7B parameter LLM, demonstrating excellent performance on challenging KB-VQA datasets.

Conclusion: The caption-rerank process enables LLMs to better understand image information and questions, enhancing reasoning ability and task adaptability without costly end-to-end training.

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality knowledge is a central focus in Knowledge-Based Visual
Question Answering (KB-VQA). Recent methods use large language models (LLMs) as
knowledge engines for answering. These methods generally employ image captions
as visual text descriptions to assist LLMs in interpreting images. However, the
captions frequently include excessive noise irrelevant to the question, and
LLMs generally do not comprehend VQA tasks, limiting their reasoning
capabilities. To address this issue, we propose the Summarized Caption-Rerank
Augmented VQA (SCRA-VQA), which employs a pre-trained visual language model to
convert images into captions. Moreover, SCRA-VQA generates contextual examples
for the captions while simultaneously summarizing and reordering them to
exclude unrelated information. The caption-rerank process enables LLMs to
understand the image information and questions better, thus enhancing the
model's reasoning ability and task adaptability without expensive end-to-end
training. Based on an LLM with 6.7B parameters, SCRA-VQA performs excellently
on two challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets: OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, achieving
accuracies of 38.8% and 34.6%. Our code is available at

*Jiabei Zhang,Qi Wang,Siyu Wu,Du Chen,Tianhe Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fidelity and adversarial objectives in perceptual optimization show asymmetric effectiveness between optimization and image quality assessment tasks, with fidelity metrics that excel in IQA not necessarily effective for optimization, especially under adversarial training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically analyze the correlation between optimization objectives' effectiveness and their capability as image quality assessment metrics, which remains underexplored despite their central role in perceptual optimization.

Method: Conducted systematic analysis revealing asymmetry between perceptual optimization and assessment, examining discriminator design impact including patch-level and convolutional architectures versus vanilla or Transformer-based alternatives.

Result: Fidelity metrics effective for IQA are not necessarily effective for perceptual optimization, with misalignment more distinct under adversarial training. Discriminator design plays decisive role in optimization, with patch-level and convolutional architectures providing better detail reconstruction.

Conclusion: These insights advance understanding of loss function design and its connection to IQA transferability, paving way for more principled approaches to perceptual optimization.

Abstract: Perceptual optimization is primarily driven by the fidelity objective, which
enforces both semantic consistency and overall visual realism, while the
adversarial objective provides complementary refinement by enhancing perceptual
sharpness and fine-grained detail. Despite their central role, the correlation
between their effectiveness as optimization objectives and their capability as
image quality assessment (IQA) metrics remains underexplored. In this work, we
conduct a systematic analysis and reveal an unanticipated asymmetry between
perceptual optimization and assessment: fidelity metrics that excel in IQA are
not necessarily effective for perceptual optimization, with this misalignment
emerging more distinctly under adversarial training. In addition, while
discriminators effectively suppress artifacts during optimization, their
learned representations offer only limited benefits when reused as backbone
initializations for IQA models. Beyond this asymmetry, our findings further
demonstrate that discriminator design plays a decisive role in shaping
optimization, with patch-level and convolutional architectures providing more
faithful detail reconstruction than vanilla or Transformer-based alternatives.
These insights advance the understanding of loss function design and its
connection to IQA transferability, paving the way for more principled
approaches to perceptual optimization.

TL;DR: IOG-VQA is a novel VQA model that integrates Object Interaction Self-Attention and GAN-Based Debiasing to address dataset biases and improve visual reasoning by capturing complex object interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQA models struggle with biases from training data, leading to over-reliance on superficial patterns and poor generalization to diverse questions and images.

Method: Combines Object Interaction Self-Attention to capture complex object interactions within images and GAN-Based Debiasing to generate unbiased data distributions for more robust feature learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets show excellent performance compared to existing methods, particularly in handling biased and imbalanced data distributions.

Conclusion: The model effectively addresses both object interactions and dataset biases, highlighting their importance in advancing VQA tasks.

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) presents a unique challenge by requiring
models to understand and reason about visual content to answer questions
accurately. Existing VQA models often struggle with biases introduced by the
training data, leading to over-reliance on superficial patterns and inadequate
generalization to diverse questions and images. This paper presents a novel
model, IOG-VQA, which integrates Object Interaction Self-Attention and
GAN-Based Debiasing to enhance VQA model performance. The self-attention
mechanism allows our model to capture complex interactions between objects
within an image, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the visual
context. Meanwhile, the GAN-based debiasing framework generates unbiased data
distributions, helping the model to learn more robust and generalizable
features. By leveraging these two components, IOG-VQA effectively combines
visual and textual information to address the inherent biases in VQA datasets.
Extensive experiments on the VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets demonstrate that
our model shows excellent performance compared with the existing methods,
particularly in handling biased and imbalanced data distributions highlighting
the importance of addressing both object interactions and dataset biases in
advancing VQA tasks. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video sequences often contain structured noise and background artifacts that obscure dynamic content, and traditional robust principal component analysis (RPCA) methods fail to capture the rich variability in real video data due to their sparsity assumptions.

Method: A hybrid framework that integrates low-rank temporal modeling with diffusion posterior sampling, called Nuclear Diffusion, which combines model-based temporal models with deep generative priors.

Result: The method demonstrates improved dehazing performance on cardiac ultrasound imaging compared to traditional RPCA, with better contrast enhancement (gCNR) and signal preservation (KS statistic).

Conclusion: The results highlight the potential of combining model-based temporal models with deep generative priors for high-fidelity video restoration applications.

Abstract: Video sequences often contain structured noise and background artifacts that
obscure dynamic content, posing challenges for accurate analysis and
restoration. Robust principal component methods address this by decomposing
data into low-rank and sparse components. Still, the sparsity assumption often
fails to capture the rich variability present in real video data. To overcome
this limitation, a hybrid framework that integrates low-rank temporal modeling
with diffusion posterior sampling is proposed. The proposed method, Nuclear
Diffusion, is evaluated on a real-world medical imaging problem, namely cardiac
ultrasound dehazing, and demonstrates improved dehazing performance compared to
traditional RPCA concerning contrast enhancement (gCNR) and signal preservation
(KS statistic). These results highlight the potential of combining model-based
temporal models with deep generative priors for high-fidelity video
restoration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing realism of synthetic images from advanced models like VAEs, GANs, and LDMs creates challenges for detection, requiring methods to identify subtle generation artifacts.

Method: Leverages local pixel dependencies based on Markov Random Fields to reconstruct images and expose texture/edge inconsistencies, then uses a lightweight neural network (FerretNet) with only 1.1M parameters for detection.

Result: Achieves 97.1% average accuracy on an open-world benchmark of 22 generative models, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 10.6% when trained only on ProGAN dataset.

Conclusion: FerretNet provides efficient and robust synthetic image detection by focusing on fundamental generation artifacts, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse generative models with minimal training data.

Abstract: The increasing realism of synthetic images generated by advanced models such
as VAEs, GANs, and LDMs poses significant challenges for synthetic image
detection. To address this issue, we explore two artifact types introduced
during the generation process: (1) latent distribution deviations and (2)
decoding-induced smoothing effects, which manifest as inconsistencies in local
textures, edges, and color transitions. Leveraging local pixel dependencies
(LPD) properties rooted in Markov Random Fields, we reconstruct synthetic
images using neighboring pixel information to expose disruptions in texture
continuity and edge coherence. Building upon LPD, we propose FerretNet, a
lightweight neural network with only 1.1M parameters that delivers efficient
and robust synthetic image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FerretNet, trained exclusively on the 4-class ProGAN dataset, achieves an
average accuracy of 97.1% on an open-world benchmark comprising across 22

*Patrick Knab,Sascha Marton,Philipp J. Schubert,Drago Guggiana,Christian Bartelt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoTIF extends Concept Bottleneck Models to video classification by handling temporal dependencies and sequences of arbitrary length, enabling interpretable concept-based analysis across global, local, and temporal perspectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending interpretable concept-based models from static images to video data is challenging due to temporal dependencies essential for capturing actions and events in videos.

Method: Introduces MoTIF, a transformer-inspired architecture that adapts concept bottleneck framework for video classification, handling sequences of arbitrary length and capturing temporal concept dependencies.

Result: Demonstrates that concept-based modeling can be effectively transferred to video data, enabling better understanding of concept contributions in temporal contexts while maintaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: The MoTIF framework successfully extends interpretable concept bottleneck models to video classification, providing three complementary perspectives for analyzing concept importance and temporal dependencies in videos.

Abstract: Conceptual models such as Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have driven
substantial progress in improving interpretability for image classification by
leveraging human-interpretable concepts. However, extending these models from
static images to sequences of images, such as video data, introduces a
significant challenge due to the temporal dependencies inherent in videos,
which are essential for capturing actions and events. In this work, we
introduce MoTIF (Moving Temporal Interpretable Framework), an architectural
design inspired by a transformer that adapts the concept bottleneck framework
for video classification and handles sequences of arbitrary length. Within the
video domain, concepts refer to semantic entities such as objects, attributes,
or higher-level components (e.g., 'bow', 'mount', 'shoot') that reoccur across
time - forming motifs collectively describing and explaining actions. Our
design explicitly enables three complementary perspectives: global concept
importance across the entire video, local concept relevance within specific
windows, and temporal dependencies of a concept over time. Our results
demonstrate that the concept-based modeling paradigm can be effectively
transferred to video data, enabling a better understanding of concept
contributions in temporal contexts while maintaining competitive performance.

*Julius Pesonen,Arno Solin,Eija Honkavaara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Particle filters can solve 3D object localization for distant objects where traditional methods like dense depth estimation fail, particularly useful for drone-based wildfire monitoring with limited computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D object localization methods (dense depth estimation, 3D scene reconstruction) are infeasible for distant objects or computationally constrained tasks like drone-based wildfire monitoring.

Method: Uses particle filters for single and multiple target scenarios, tested with 3D simulation and drone-based image segmentation sequences using GNSS-based camera pose estimates.

Result: Particle filters successfully solved practical localization tasks using camera poses and image segments in situations where other methods fail, demonstrating applicability for drone-based wildfire monitoring.

Conclusion: The particle filter approach is flexible, detection-method independent, and enables practical drone-based wildfire monitoring when paired with existing image segmentation models.

Abstract: 3D object localisation based on a sequence of camera measurements is
essential for safety-critical surveillance tasks, such as drone-based wildfire
monitoring. Localisation of objects detected with a camera can typically be
solved with dense depth estimation or 3D scene reconstruction. However, in the
context of distant objects or tasks limited by the amount of available
computational resources, neither solution is feasible. In this paper, we show
that the task can be solved using particle filters for both single and multiple
target scenarios. The method was studied using a 3D simulation and a
drone-based image segmentation sequence with global navigation satellite system
(GNSS)-based camera pose estimates. The results showed that a particle filter
can be used to solve practical localisation tasks based on camera poses and
image segments in these situations where other solutions fail. The particle
filter is independent of the detection method, making it flexible for new
tasks. The study also demonstrates that drone-based wildfire monitoring can be
conducted using the proposed method paired with a pre-existing image
segmentation model.

*Qinfeng Zhu,Han Li,Liang He,Lei Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SwinMamba is a novel framework that combines Vision Mamba's global receptive field with Swin Transformer's local scanning to improve semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery by capturing both local details and global context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Mamba's global scanning approach overlooks critical local features like textures and edges, which are essential for accurate semantic segmentation in remote sensing data with complex scene structures and diverse object scales.

Method: SwinMamba integrates localized Mamba-style scanning within shifted windows with global receptive field. The first two stages perform local scanning for fine-grained details, while subsequent stages use global scanning for contextual information. Overlapping shifted windows enhance inter-region information exchange.

Result: Extensive experiments on LoveDA and ISPRS Potsdam datasets show that SwinMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods in semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery.

Conclusion: SwinMamba demonstrates effectiveness as a superior solution for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed imagery by effectively capturing both local and global features through its hybrid scanning approach.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery is a fundamental task in
computer vision, supporting a wide range of applications such as land use
classification, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. However, this
task is often challenged by the high spatial resolution, complex scene
structures, and diverse object scales present in remote sensing data. To
address these challenges, various deep learning architectures have been
proposed, including convolutional neural networks, Vision Transformers, and the
recently introduced Vision Mamba. Vision Mamba features a global receptive
field and low computational complexity, demonstrating both efficiency and
effectiveness in image segmentation. However, its reliance on global scanning
tends to overlook critical local features, such as textures and edges, which
are essential for achieving accurate segmentation in remote sensing contexts.
To tackle this limitation, we propose SwinMamba, a novel framework inspired by
the Swin Transformer. SwinMamba integrates localized Mamba-style scanning
within shifted windows with a global receptive field, to enhance the model's
perception of both local and global features. Specifically, the first two
stages of SwinMamba perform local scanning to capture fine-grained details,
while its subsequent two stages leverage global scanning to fuse broader
contextual information. In our model, the use of overlapping shifted windows
enhances inter-region information exchange, facilitating more robust feature
integration across the entire image. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA and
ISPRS Potsdam datasets demonstrate that SwinMamba outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, underscoring its effectiveness and potential as a superior solution
for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed imagery.

*Wenhao Tang,Heng Fang,Ge Wu,Xiang Li,Ming-Ming Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pack-based multiple instance learning framework for computational pathology that addresses challenges of extreme sequence length variations in whole slide images by packing variable-length sequences into fixed-length ones for efficient training, achieving significant accuracy improvements with reduced training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Whole slide images in computational pathology have extreme sequence length variations (200 to 200K), high data heterogeneity, redundancy, and limited supervision, which conventional methods struggle to handle efficiently while preserving data diversity.

Method: Proposes a pack-based MIL framework that packs multiple variable-length feature sequences into fixed-length ones for batched training, a residual branch that composes discarded features into hyperslides for multi-slide supervision, and an attention-driven downsampler to reduce feature redundancy.

Result: Achieves up to 8% accuracy improvement while using only 12% of the training time in the PANDA(UNI) benchmark, demonstrating significant efficiency and performance gains.

Conclusion: Addressing data challenges in computational pathology through the proposed framework shows significant potential, especially in the era of foundation models, with the approach effectively handling extreme sequence length variations and limited supervision.

Abstract: Computational pathology (CPath) digitizes pathology slides into whole slide
images (WSIs), enabling analysis for critical healthcare tasks such as cancer
diagnosis and prognosis. However, WSIs possess extremely long sequence lengths
(up to 200K), significant length variations (from 200 to 200K), and limited
supervision. These extreme variations in sequence length lead to high data
heterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods often compromise on training
efficiency and optimization to preserve such heterogeneity under limited
supervision. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a
pack-based MIL framework. It packs multiple sampled, variable-length feature
sequences into fixed-length ones, enabling batched training while preserving
data heterogeneity. Moreover, we introduce a residual branch that composes
discarded features from multiple slides into a hyperslide which is trained with
tailored labels. It offers multi-slide supervision while mitigating feature
loss from sampling. Meanwhile, an attention-driven downsampler is introduced to
compress features in both branches to reduce redundancy. By alleviating these
challenges, our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 8% while
using only 12% of the training time in the PANDA(UNI). Extensive experiments
demonstrate that focusing data challenges in CPath holds significant potential
in the era of foundation models. The code is

*Akihisa Watanabe,Jiawei Ren,Li Siyao,Yichen Peng,Erwin Wu,Edgar Simo-Serra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimDiff is a simulator-constrained diffusion model that generates physically plausible human motion by integrating environment parameters directly into the denoising process, eliminating the need for computationally expensive simulator calls during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for generating physically plausible human motion use simulator-based motion projection layers which are computationally expensive due to their sequential nature and prevent parallelization. This limits efficiency and scalability.

Method: The paper proposes SimDiff, which interprets simulator-based motion projection as a form of guidance within the diffusion process. It integrates environment parameters (gravity, wind) directly into the denoising process, conditioning the diffusion model on these physical parameters.

Result: SimDiff generates physically plausible motions efficiently without repeated simulator calls at inference, provides fine-grained control over different physical coefficients, and demonstrates compositional generalization to unseen combinations of environmental parameters.

Conclusion: By treating physical constraints as guidance within the diffusion framework, SimDiff achieves both computational efficiency and physical plausibility while enabling flexible control over environmental conditions and showing strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Generating physically plausible human motion is crucial for applications such
as character animation and virtual reality. Existing approaches often
incorporate a simulator-based motion projection layer to the diffusion process
to enforce physical plausibility. However, such methods are computationally
expensive due to the sequential nature of the simulator, which prevents
parallelization. We show that simulator-based motion projection can be
interpreted as a form of guidance, either classifier-based or classifier-free,
within the diffusion process. Building on this insight, we propose SimDiff, a
Simulator-constrained Diffusion Model that integrates environment parameters
(e.g., gravity, wind) directly into the denoising process. By conditioning on
these parameters, SimDiff generates physically plausible motions efficiently,
without repeated simulator calls at inference, and also provides fine-grained
control over different physical coefficients. Moreover, SimDiff successfully
generalizes to unseen combinations of environmental parameters, demonstrating
compositional generalization.

*Bum Jun Kim,Makoto Kawano,Yusuke Iwasawa,Yutaka Matsuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates architectural design choices that make vision models inherently more robust to Gaussian noise, identifying four key patterns and providing theoretical explanations for their effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While vision model robustness is often measured, the specific architectural dependencies are rarely analyzed. The authors aim to understand why certain architectures are more robust and convert these insights into actionable design rules.

Method: Extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained vision models to identify robust design patterns, followed by theoretical analysis to explain the observed correlations through causal mechanisms including kernel size effects, downsampling factors, pooling operations, and preprocessing differences.

Result: Identified four consistent design patterns: larger stem kernels, smaller input resolutions, average pooling, and supervised ViTs over CLIP ViTs, yielding up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6% accuracy gains. Theoretical analysis proved noise attenuation mechanisms and explained CLIP ViT vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: The research disentangles robustness into interpretable modules, provides theoretical explanations for observed trends, and offers practical plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more robust against Gaussian noise.

Abstract: While the robustness of vision models is often measured, their dependence on
specific architectural design choices is rarely dissected. We investigate why
certain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian
noise and convert these empirical insights into simple, actionable design
rules. Specifically, we performed extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained
vision models, empirically identifying four consistent design patterns for
improved robustness against Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input
resolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers (ViTs) rather
than CLIP ViTs, which yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6\%p accuracy
gains. We then develop a theoretical analysis that explains these findings,
converting observed correlations into causal mechanisms. First, we prove that
low-pass stem kernels attenuate noise with a gain that decreases quadratically
with kernel size and that anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy
roughly in proportion to the square of the downsampling factor. Second, we
demonstrate that average pooling is unbiased and suppresses noise in proportion
to the pooling window area, whereas max pooling incurs a positive bias that
grows slowly with window size and yields a relatively higher mean-squared error
and greater worst-case sensitivity. Third, we reveal and explain the
vulnerability of CLIP ViTs via a pixel-space Lipschitz bound: The smaller
normalization standard deviations used in CLIP preprocessing amplify worst-case
sensitivity by up to 1.91 times relative to the Inception-style preprocessing
common in supervised ViTs. Our results collectively disentangle robustness into
interpretable modules, provide a theory that explains the observed trends, and
build practical, plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more
robust against Gaussian noise.

Method: PRISMA-ScR-guided scoping review that systematically analyzes scene graph research in surgical contexts, examining applications, methodological progress, and identifying research gaps.

Result: The review reveals rapid growth in surgical scene graph research but uncovers a critical 'data divide' - internal-view research uses real-world 2D video while external-view 4D modeling relies on simulated data. Methodologically, the field has advanced from graph neural networks to specialized foundation models that outperform generalist large vision-language models in surgical contexts.

Conclusion: Surgical scene graphs are maturing into an essential semantic bridge that enables intelligent systems for improving surgical safety, efficiency, and training, despite ongoing challenges in data annotation and real-time implementation.

Abstract: Scene graphs (SGs) provide structured relational representations crucial for
decoding complex, dynamic surgical environments. This PRISMA-ScR-guided scoping
review systematically maps the evolving landscape of SG research in surgery,
charting its applications, methodological advancements, and future directions.
Our analysis reveals rapid growth, yet uncovers a critical 'data divide':
internal-view research (e.g., triplet recognition) almost exclusively uses
real-world 2D video, while external-view 4D modeling relies heavily on
simulated data, exposing a key translational research gap. Methodologically,
the field has advanced from foundational graph neural networks to specialized
foundation models that now significantly outperform generalist large
vision-language models in surgical contexts. This progress has established SGs
as a cornerstone technology for both analysis, such as workflow recognition and
automated safety monitoring, and generative tasks like controllable surgical

Motivation: The proliferation of financial advisory content on social media through lengthy podcast videos (30-40 minutes) makes it challenging to extract meaningful insights efficiently. There is a need for automated summarization that handles multimodal content while ensuring factual accuracy.

Method: FASTER employs BLIP for visual descriptions, OCR for text patterns, and Whisper with speaker diarization for transcription. It uses a modified DPO-based loss function with fact-checking and a ranker-based retrieval mechanism to align keyframes with summarized content.

Result: Comprehensive cross-domain experiments show FASTER outperforms Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in performance, robustness, and generalizability. The framework also introduces Fin-APT, a dataset of 470 financial advisory videos.

Conclusion: FASTER sets a new standard for multimodal summarization, making financial advisory content more accessible and actionable, and opens new research avenues. The dataset and code are publicly available.

Abstract: The dynamic propagation of social media has broadened the reach of financial
advisory content through podcast videos, yet extracting insights from lengthy,
multimodal segments (30-40 minutes) remains challenging. We introduce FASTER
(Financial Advisory Summariser with Textual Embedded Relevant images), a
modular framework that tackles three key challenges: (1) extracting
modality-specific features, (2) producing optimized, concise summaries, and (3)
aligning visual keyframes with associated textual points. FASTER employs BLIP
for semantic visual descriptions, OCR for textual patterns, and Whisper-based
transcription with Speaker diarization as BOS features. A modified Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO)-based loss function, equipped with BOS-specific
fact-checking, ensures precision, relevance, and factual consistency against
the human-aligned summary. A ranker-based retrieval mechanism further aligns
keyframes with summarized content, enhancing interpretability and cross-modal
coherence. To acknowledge data resource scarcity, we introduce Fin-APT, a
dataset comprising 470 publicly accessible financial advisory pep-talk videos
for robust multimodal research. Comprehensive cross-domain experiments confirm
FASTER's strong performance, robustness, and generalizability when compared to

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSL-integrated deep clustering methods require prerequisites like pretraining or trained models, limiting flexible out-of-box application of SSL learners in image clustering tasks.

Method: Randomly sample pseudo-labeled data, use instance-level classifier to learn them, track class transitions to extract high-level similarities, assign cluster-level labels, and use pseudo-labeled data to trigger SSL learner training.

Result: Superior performance across benchmarks against latest deep image clustering approaches, with only 1.33% accuracy gap on CIFAR-10 compared to SSL methods using ground-truth. ASD also boosts existing SSL-embedded methods.

Conclusion: ASD provides a practical solution for cold-start SSL application in image clustering without prerequisites, achieving competitive performance and enhancing existing methods.

Abstract: Recently, some works integrate SSL techniques into deep clustering frameworks
to enhance image clustering performance. However, they all need pretraining,
clustering learning, or a trained clustering model as prerequisites, limiting
the flexible and out-of-box application of SSL learners in the image clustering
task. This work introduces ASD, an adaptor that enables the cold-start of SSL
learners for deep image clustering without any prerequisites. Specifically, we
first randomly sample pseudo-labeled data from all unlabeled data, and set an
instance-level classifier to learn them with semantically aligned
instance-level labels. With the ability of instance-level classification, we
track the class transitions of predictions on unlabeled data to extract
high-level similarities of instance-level classes, which can be utilized to
assign cluster-level labels to pseudo-labeled data. Finally, we use the
pseudo-labeled data with assigned cluster-level labels to trigger a general SSL
learner trained on the unlabeled data for image clustering. We show the
superior performance of ASD across various benchmarks against the latest deep
image clustering approaches and very slight accuracy gaps compared to SSL
methods using ground-truth, e.g., only 1.33% on CIFAR-10. Moreover, ASD can
also further boost the performance of existing SSL-embedded deep image
clustering methods.

TL;DR: SiNGER is a novel distillation framework that suppresses high-norm artifacts in Vision Transformers while preserving informative signals, achieving state-of-the-art performance through nullspace-guided feature refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers produce high-norm artifacts that degrade representation quality. When knowledge distillation transfers these features to students, artifacts dominate the objective, causing students to overfit to artifacts and underweight informative signals, diminishing gains from larger models.

Method: Singular Nullspace-Guided Energy Reallocation (SiNGER) uses principled teacher feature refinement with nullspace-guided perturbation to preserve information while suppressing artifacts. This is implemented efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter requiring minimal structural modification.

Result: Extensive experiments show SiNGER consistently improves student models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple downstream tasks and producing clearer, more interpretable representations.

Conclusion: SiNGER effectively addresses the trade-off between artifact suppression and signal preservation in knowledge distillation, enabling better transfer of informative features from teacher to student models.

Abstract: Vision Transformers are widely adopted as the backbone of vision foundation
models, but they are known to produce high-norm artifacts that degrade
representation quality. When knowledge distillation transfers these features to
students, high-norm artifacts dominate the objective, so students overfit to
artifacts and underweight informative signals, diminishing the gains from
larger models. Prior work attempted to remove artifacts but encountered an
inherent trade-off between artifact suppression and preserving informative
signals from teachers. To address this, we introduce Singular Nullspace-Guided
Energy Reallocation (SiNGER), a novel distillation framework that suppresses
artifacts while preserving informative signals. The key idea is principled
teacher feature refinement: during refinement, we leverage the nullspace-guided
perturbation to preserve information while suppressing artifacts. Then, the
refined teacher's features are distilled to a student. We implement this
perturbation efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter that requires minimal
structural modification. Extensive experiments show that \oursname consistently
improves student models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple
downstream tasks and producing clearer and more interpretable representations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SNCE is a novel method that achieves precise harmful concept erasure in text-to-image models by manipulating only a single neuron, using sparse autoencoders and frequency-based neuron identification to maintain image quality while removing target concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models pose safety risks by generating harmful content, and existing concept erasure methods struggle with precise removal while minimizing degradation of image quality.

Method: Train a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to map text embeddings into a sparse latent space, identify harmful concept-specific neurons using modulated frequency scoring of activation patterns, and suppress activations of those neurons.

Result: SNCE achieves state-of-the-art results in target concept erasure while preserving generation capabilities for non-target concepts, and exhibits strong robustness against adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: The proposed SNCE method enables surgical precision in concept erasure with minimal disruption to image quality, significantly outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Text-to-image models exhibit remarkable capabilities in image generation.
However, they also pose safety risks of generating harmful content. A key
challenge of existing concept erasure methods is the precise removal of target
concepts while minimizing degradation of image quality. In this paper, we
propose Single Neuron-based Concept Erasure (SNCE), a novel approach that can
precisely prevent harmful content generation by manipulating only a single
neuron. Specifically, we train a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to map text
embeddings into a sparse, disentangled latent space, where individual neurons
align tightly with atomic semantic concepts. To accurately locate neurons
responsible for harmful concepts, we design a novel neuron identification
method based on the modulated frequency scoring of activation patterns. By
suppressing activations of the harmful concept-specific neuron, SNCE achieves
surgical precision in concept erasure with minimal disruption to image quality.
Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that SNCE achieves
state-of-the-art results in target concept erasure, while preserving the
model's generation capabilities for non-target concepts. Additionally, our
method exhibits strong robustness against adversarial attacks, significantly
outperforming existing methods.

*Andreas Gilson,Lukas Meyer,Oliver Scholz,Ute Schmid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes KD-SS, a lightweight sub-sampling algorithm for plant point clouds that avoids down-sampling while enabling full-resolution segmentation across different plant species and sensor modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing plant organ segmentation methods are problem-specific, require extensive pre-processing, and force down-sampling to meet hardware/network constraints, limiting their applicability across different species and sensors.

Method: KD-SS algorithm for biological point cloud sub-sampling that is sensor-agnostic and species-agnostic, allowing segmentation of full-resolution point clouds without down-sampling.

Result: Combining KD-SS with state-of-the-art segmentation models achieves satisfying results across different modalities (photogrammetry, laser triangulation, LiDAR) and various plant species.

Conclusion: KD-SS serves as a lightweight, resolution-retaining alternative to intensive pre-processing and down-sampling methods for plant organ segmentation, working regardless of species and sensor modality.

Abstract: Accurate point cloud segmentation for plant organs is crucial for 3D plant
phenotyping. Existing solutions are designed problem-specific with a focus on
certain plant species or specified sensor-modalities for data acquisition.
Furthermore, it is common to use extensive pre-processing and down-sample the
plant point clouds to meet hardware or neural network input size requirements.
We propose a simple, yet effective algorithm KDSS for sub-sampling of
biological point clouds that is agnostic to sensor data and plant species. The
main benefit of this approach is that we do not need to down-sample our input
data and thus, enable segmentation of the full-resolution point cloud.
Combining KD-SS with current state-of-the-art segmentation models shows
satisfying results evaluated on different modalities such as photogrammetry,
laser triangulation and LiDAR for various plant species. We propose KD-SS as
lightweight resolution-retaining alternative to intensive pre-processing and
down-sampling methods for plant organ segmentation regardless of used species
and sensor modality.

*Songyue Cai,Zongqian Wu,Yujie Mo,Liang Peng,Ping Hu,Xiaoshuang Shi,Xiaofeng Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mambo is a new FG-BG decomposition framework for few-shot out-of-distribution detection that addresses robustness issues in previous methods by combining local background and class similarities with flexible patch selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FG-BG decomposition methods suffer from low robustness due to over-reliance on local class similarity and fixed background patch extraction strategies.

Method: Proposes learning a background prompt to obtain local background similarity, refining it with local class similarity, and using patch self-calibrated tuning for flexible background patch selection based on sample diversity.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show Mambo achieves state-of-the-art performance in OOD detection and near OOD detection settings.

Conclusion: Mambo effectively addresses the limitations of previous methods by reducing dependence on local class similarity and introducing flexible background extraction, demonstrating superior performance in FS-OOD detection.

Abstract: Existing foreground-background (FG-BG) decomposition methods for the few-shot
out-of-distribution (FS-OOD) detection often suffer from low robustness due to
over-reliance on the local class similarity and a fixed background patch
extraction strategy. To address these challenges, we propose a new FG-BG
decomposition framework, namely Mambo, for FS-OOD detection. Specifically, we
propose to first learn a background prompt to obtain the local background
similarity containing both the background and image semantic information, and
then refine the local background similarity using the local class similarity.
As a result, we use both the refined local background similarity and the local
class similarity to conduct background extraction, reducing the dependence of
the local class similarity in previous methods. Furthermore, we propose the
patch self-calibrated tuning to consider the sample diversity to flexibly
select numbers of background patches for different samples, and thus exploring
the issue of fixed background extraction strategies in previous methods.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed
Mambo achieves the best performance, compared to SOTA methods in terms of OOD
detection and near OOD detection setting. The source code will be released at

*Naga Venkata Sai Jitin Jami,Thomas Altstidl,Jonas Mueller,Jindong Li,Dario Zanca,Bjoern Eskofier,Heike Leutheuser*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces two methods for creating representative dataset splits in image segmentation: Iterative Pixel Stratification (IPS) and Wasserstein-Driven Evolutionary Stratification (WDES), with WDES proving globally optimal and particularly valuable for small, imbalanced datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random dataset splitting in image segmentation leads to unrepresentative test sets, biased evaluations, and poor model generalization. While stratified sampling works for classification, extending it to segmentation is challenging due to multi-label structure and class imbalance.

Method: Two approaches: 1) Iterative Pixel Stratification (IPS) - a label-aware sampling method for segmentation tasks; 2) Wasserstein-Driven Evolutionary Stratification (WDES) - a genetic algorithm that minimizes Wasserstein distance to optimize label distribution similarity across dataset splits.

Result: WDES consistently produces more representative splits than random sampling, leading to lower performance variance and improved model evaluation across diverse segmentation tasks (street scenes, medical imaging, satellite imagery). WDES is particularly effective for small, imbalanced, and low-diversity datasets.

Conclusion: WDES is a globally optimal method for creating representative dataset splits in segmentation tasks, addressing the limitations of conventional splitting strategies and reducing evaluation bias, especially in challenging dataset scenarios.

Abstract: Random splitting of datasets in image segmentation often leads to
unrepresentative test sets, resulting in biased evaluations and poor model
generalization. While stratified sampling has proven effective for addressing
label distribution imbalance in classification tasks, extending these ideas to
segmentation remains challenging due to the multi-label structure and class
imbalance typically present in such data. Building on existing stratification
concepts, we introduce Iterative Pixel Stratification (IPS), a straightforward,
label-aware sampling method tailored for segmentation tasks. Additionally, we
present Wasserstein-Driven Evolutionary Stratification (WDES), a novel genetic
algorithm designed to minimize the Wasserstein distance, thereby optimizing the
similarity of label distributions across dataset splits. We prove that WDES is
globally optimal given enough generations. Using newly proposed statistical
heterogeneity metrics, we evaluate both methods against random sampling and
find that WDES consistently produces more representative splits. Applying WDES
across diverse segmentation tasks, including street scenes, medical imaging,
and satellite imagery, leads to lower performance variance and improved model
evaluation. Our results also highlight the particular value of WDES in handling
small, imbalanced, and low-diversity datasets, where conventional splitting
strategies are most prone to bias.

*Riccardo La Grassa,Ignazio Gallo,Nicola Landro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EnGraf-Net uses semantic associations structured as a hierarchy (taxonomy) as supervised signals in an end-to-end deep neural network for fine-grained classification, achieving competitive performance without requiring cropping techniques or manual annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-grained classification models rely on part annotations or automatic cropping methods, which suffer from incomplete representation of local features. The paper posits that semantic associations structured as a hierarchy can better capture the relationships needed to distinguish highly similar classes.

Method: Proposes EnGraf-Net, an end-to-end deep neural network that leverages semantic associations structured as a taxonomy as supervised signals. The model doesn't require cropping techniques or manual annotations.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, CUB-200-2011, and FGVC-Aircraft datasets demonstrate EnGraf-Net's superiority over many existing fine-grained models, showing competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: EnGraf-Net effectively leverages semantic hierarchy as supervision for fine-grained classification, achieving strong performance without the need for part annotations or cropping techniques, demonstrating the value of semantic associations in distinguishing similar objects.

Abstract: Fine-grained classification models are designed to focus on the relevant
details necessary to distinguish highly similar classes, particularly when
intra-class variance is high and inter-class variance is low. Most existing
models rely on part annotations such as bounding boxes, part locations, or
textual attributes to enhance classification performance, while others employ
sophisticated techniques to automatically extract attention maps. We posit that
part-based approaches, including automatic cropping methods, suffer from an
incomplete representation of local features, which are fundamental for
distinguishing similar objects. While fine-grained classification aims to
recognize the leaves of a hierarchical structure, humans recognize objects by
also forming semantic associations. In this paper, we leverage semantic
associations structured as a hierarchy (taxonomy) as supervised signals within
an end-to-end deep neural network model, termed EnGraf-Net. Extensive
experiments on three well-known datasets CIFAR-100, CUB-200-2011, and
FGVC-Aircraft demonstrate the superiority of EnGraf-Net over many existing
fine-grained models, showing competitive performance with the most recent
state-of-the-art approaches, without requiring cropping techniques or manual
annotations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Transformers (ViTs) are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks despite their robustness advantages over CNNs, with attack success rates varying from 40.04% to 99.97% across different ViT models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the transferability of adversarial attack techniques from CNNs to ViTs and assess ViT vulnerability to evasion attacks using realistic adversarial patches.

Method: Used Creases Transformation (CT) technique to design realistic adversarial patches that cause misclassification in person vs. non-person classification tasks. Evaluated four fine-tuned ViT models on binary person classification.

Result: Significant vulnerability variations observed: 40.04% success on google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k, 99.97% on facebook/dino-vitb16, 66.40% on google/vit-base-patch16-224, and 65.17% on facebook/dinov3-vitb16.

Conclusion: Adversarial patches successfully transfer from CNNs to ViTs, with pre-training dataset scale and methodology strongly influencing model resilience to adversarial attacks.

Abstract: The increasing reliance on machine learning systems has made their security a
critical concern. Evasion attacks enable adversaries to manipulate the
decision-making processes of AI systems, potentially causing security breaches
or misclassification of targets. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained
significant traction in modern machine learning due to increased 1) performance
compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and 2) robustness against
adversarial perturbations. However, ViTs remain vulnerable to evasion attacks,
particularly to adversarial patches, unique patterns designed to manipulate AI
classification systems. These vulnerabilities are investigated by designing
realistic adversarial patches to cause misclassification in person vs.
non-person classification tasks using the Creases Transformation (CT)
technique, which adds subtle geometric distortions similar to those occurring
naturally when wearing clothing. This study investigates the transferability of
adversarial attack techniques used in CNNs when applied to ViT classification
models. Experimental evaluation across four fine-tuned ViT models on a binary
person classification task reveals significant vulnerability variations: attack
success rates ranged from 40.04% (google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) to 99.97%
(facebook/dino-vitb16), with google/vit-base-patch16-224 achieving 66.40% and
facebook/dinov3-vitb16 reaching 65.17%. These results confirm the
cross-architectural transferability of adversarial patches from CNNs to ViTs,
with pre-training dataset scale and methodology strongly influencing model
resilience to adversarial attacks.

TL;DR: UniTransfer is a novel architecture for video concept transfer that uses spatial and temporal decomposition with a progressive diffusion approach, achieving precise control over foreground, background, and motion components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable high-quality and controllable video concept transfer by decomposing videos into key components (foreground, background, motion) and diffusion timesteps, allowing fine-grained editing control across different video elements.

Method: Uses spatial decomposition into foreground subject, background, and motion flow; dual-to-single-stream DiT-based architecture; self-supervised pretraining with random masking; Chain-of-Prompt mechanism for timestep decomposition; three-stage granular denoising process guided by LLM instructions.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method achieves high-quality and controllable video concept transfer across diverse reference images and scenes, surpassing existing baselines in both visual fidelity and editability.

Conclusion: UniTransfer successfully demonstrates precise video concept transfer through spatial and temporal decomposition, with the curated OpenAnimal dataset facilitating future research in this domain.

Abstract: We propose a novel architecture UniTransfer, which introduces both spatial
and diffusion timestep decomposition in a progressive paradigm, achieving
precise and controllable video concept transfer. Specifically, in terms of
spatial decomposition, we decouple videos into three key components: the
foreground subject, the background, and the motion flow. Building upon this
decomposed formulation, we further introduce a dual-to-single-stream DiT-based
architecture for supporting fine-grained control over different components in
the videos. We also introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on
random masking to enhance the decomposed representation learning from
large-scale unlabeled video data. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought reasoning
paradigm, we further revisit the denoising diffusion process and propose a
Chain-of-Prompt (CoP) mechanism to achieve the timestep decomposition. We
decompose the denoising process into three stages of different granularity and
leverage large language models (LLMs) for stage-specific instructions to guide
the generation progressively. We also curate an animal-centric video dataset
called OpenAnimal to facilitate the advancement and benchmarking of research in
video concept transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves high-quality and controllable video concept transfer across diverse
reference images and scenes, surpassing existing baselines in both visual
fidelity and editability. Web Page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VTTS enhances multimodal LLM reasoning through iterative perception during inference, mimicking human hierarchical attention by progressively refining focus on high-confidence regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM methods are limited by static perception stages that analyze parsed visuals without iterative refinement during inference.

Method: VTTS uses Iterative Perception mechanism with reinforcement learning and spatio-temporal supervision, plus VTTS-80K dataset for iterative perception training.

Result: Videochat-R1.5 model achieves average 5%+ improvement over baselines across 15+ benchmarks for video conversation, reasoning, and spatio-temporal perception.

Conclusion: VTTS enables MLLMs to enhance performance by increasing perceptual compute through iterative perception, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Inducing reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is critical
for achieving human-level perception and understanding. Existing methods mainly
leverage LLM reasoning to analyze parsed visuals, often limited by static
perception stages. This paper introduces Visual Test-Time Scaling (VTTS), a
novel approach to enhance MLLMs' reasoning via iterative perception during
inference. VTTS mimics humans' hierarchical attention by progressively refining
focus on high-confidence spatio-temporal regions, guided by updated textual
predictions. Specifically, VTTS employs an Iterative Perception (ITP)
mechanism, incorporating reinforcement learning with spatio-temporal
supervision to optimize reasoning. To support this paradigm, we also present
VTTS-80K, a dataset tailored for iterative perception. These designs allows a
MLLM to enhance its performance by increasing its perceptual compute. Extensive
experiments validate VTTS's effectiveness and generalization across diverse
tasks and benchmarks. Our newly introduced Videochat-R1.5 model has achieved
remarkable improvements, with an average increase of over 5\%, compared to
robust baselines such as Qwen2.5VL-3B and -7B, across more than 15 benchmarks
that encompass video conversation, video reasoning, and spatio-temporal
perception.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mammo-CLIP Dissect is a concept-based explainability framework that uses a mammography-specific vision-language model to systematically analyze what deep learning models learn in mammography, revealing how training data and fine-tuning affect concept learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding what DL models learn is essential for safe AI deployment in clinical settings. Previous work focused on pixel-based methods, but textual concepts may better reflect clinical reasoning.

Method: Leverages Mammo-CLIP as a "dissector" to label neurons with human-interpretable textual concepts and quantify alignment to domain knowledge. Investigates concept learning differences between general vs mammography-trained models, fine-tuning effects, and underrepresented concepts.

Result: Mammography-trained models capture more clinically relevant concepts and align better with radiologists' workflows. Fine-tuning enhances certain concepts (benign calcifications) but reduces others (density features), showing a specialization-generalization trade-off.

Conclusion: Mammo-CLIP Dissect provides insights into how CNNs capture mammography knowledge, revealing how domain-specific training and task adaptation shape concept learning. The framework enables systematic model analysis for safer clinical AI deployment.

Abstract: Understanding what deep learning (DL) models learn is essential for the safe
deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical settings. While previous
work has focused on pixel-based explainability methods, less attention has been
paid to the textual concepts learned by these models, which may better reflect
the reasoning used by clinicians. We introduce Mammo-CLIP Dissect, the first
concept-based explainability framework for systematically dissecting DL vision
models trained for mammography. Leveraging a mammography-specific
vision-language model (Mammo-CLIP) as a "dissector," our approach labels
neurons at specified layers with human-interpretable textual concepts and
quantifies their alignment to domain knowledge. Using Mammo-CLIP Dissect, we
investigate three key questions: (1) how concept learning differs between DL
vision models trained on general image datasets versus mammography-specific
datasets; (2) how fine-tuning for downstream mammography tasks affects concept
specialisation; and (3) which mammography-relevant concepts remain
underrepresented. We show that models trained on mammography data capture more
clinically relevant concepts and align more closely with radiologists'
workflows than models not trained on mammography data. Fine-tuning for
task-specific classification enhances the capture of certain concept categories
(e.g., benign calcifications) but can reduce coverage of others (e.g.,
density-related features), indicating a trade-off between specialisation and
generalisation. Our findings show that Mammo-CLIP Dissect provides insights
into how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture mammography-specific
knowledge. By comparing models across training data and fine-tuning regimes, we
reveal how domain-specific training and task-specific adaptation shape concept
learning. Code and concept set are available:

TL;DR: MOSS-ChatV is a reinforcement learning framework with Dynamic Time Warping-based process reward that addresses process inconsistency in video reasoning for multimodal large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs exhibit process inconsistency where intermediate reasoning drifts from video dynamics even when final answers are correct, undermining interpretability and robustness.

Method: Introduces a reinforcement learning framework with DTW-based process reward that aligns reasoning traces with temporally grounded references, enabling efficient process supervision without auxiliary reward models. Also creates MOSS-Video benchmark with annotated reasoning traces.

Result: MOSS-ChatV achieves 87.2% on MOSS-Video test split, improves performance on general video benchmarks (MVBench and MMVU), and consistently yields gains across different architectures including Qwen2.5-VL and Phi-2. GPT-4o-as-judge evaluations show more consistent and stable reasoning traces.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates broad applicability and effectiveness in producing consistent video reasoning processes across different model architectures.

Abstract: Video reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), requiring models to move beyond static perception
toward coherent understanding of temporal dynamics in complex scenes. Yet
existing MLLMs often exhibit process inconsistency, where intermediate
reasoning drifts from video dynamics even when the final answer is correct,
undermining interpretability and robustness. To address this issue, we
introduce MOSS-ChatV, a reinforcement learning framework with a Dynamic Time
Warping (DTW)-based process reward. This rule-based reward aligns reasoning
traces with temporally grounded references, enabling efficient process
supervision without auxiliary reward models. We further identify dynamic state
prediction as a key measure of video reasoning and construct MOSS-Video, a
benchmark with annotated reasoning traces, where the training split is used to
fine-tune MOSS-ChatV and the held-out split is reserved for evaluation.
MOSS-ChatV achieves 87.2\% on MOSS-Video (test) and improves performance on
general video benchmarks such as MVBench and MMVU. The framework consistently
yields gains across different architectures, including Qwen2.5-VL and Phi-2,
confirming its broad applicability. Evaluations with GPT-4o-as-judge further
show that MOSS-ChatV produces more consistent and stable reasoning traces.

TL;DR: A novel approach for generating videos guided by camera trajectories by integrating both camera and object motions into pixel motion using stable diffusion networks and image-to-video networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with consistency and generalizability when handling both camera and object motions, often learning them separately which causes confusion about relative motion.

Method: Proposes converting camera and object motions into pixel motion, using stable diffusion to learn reference motion maps relative to camera trajectory, then feeding these maps with semantic object prior into image-to-video network.

Result: Extensive experiments show the model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively generates videos that accurately follow designated camera trajectories while maintaining consistent object motions.

Abstract: Generating videos guided by camera trajectories poses significant challenges
in achieving consistency and generalizability, particularly when both camera
and object motions are present. Existing approaches often attempt to learn
these motions separately, which may lead to confusion regarding the relative
motion between the camera and the objects. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel approach that integrates both camera and object motions by
converting them into the motion of corresponding pixels. Utilizing a stable
diffusion network, we effectively learn reference motion maps in relation to
the specified camera trajectory. These maps, along with an extracted semantic
object prior, are then fed into an image-to-video network to generate the
desired video that can accurately follow the designated camera trajectory while
maintaining consistent object motions. Extensive experiments verify that our
model outperforms SOTA methods by a large margin.

TL;DR: Discriminators are most disadvantaged with very simple or highly complex datasets, while intermediate-complexity datasets favor detection of synthetic images due to visible generator errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the conditions where discriminators struggle most in detecting AI-generated images, examining the interplay between data dimensionality and complexity.

Method: Analysis using Kolmogorov complexity to measure dataset structure, studying how dimensionality and complexity affect the detectability of synthetic images.

Result: Simple datasets allow near-perfect generation, while highly complex datasets mask imperfections; intermediate complexity creates optimal detection conditions where generator errors remain visible.

Conclusion: The detectability of synthetic images follows a U-shaped relationship with dataset complexity, with discriminators performing best on datasets of intermediate complexity.

Abstract: The rapid progress of image generative AI has blurred the boundary between
synthetic and real images, fueling an arms race between generators and
discriminators. This paper investigates the conditions under which
discriminators are most disadvantaged in this competition. We analyze two key
factors: data dimensionality and data complexity. While increased
dimensionality often strengthens the discriminators ability to detect subtle
inconsistencies, complexity introduces a more nuanced effect. Using Kolmogorov
complexity as a measure of intrinsic dataset structure, we show that both very
simple and highly complex datasets reduce the detectability of synthetic
images; generators can learn simple datasets almost perfectly, whereas extreme
diversity masks imperfections. In contrast, intermediate-complexity datasets
create the most favorable conditions for detection, as generators fail to fully
capture the distribution and their errors remain visible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient adaptive resolution inference in CLIP models by processing images from coarse to fine resolution, allowing computational savings while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Method: Replaces standard patch embeddings with multi-level wavelet decomposition, uses key-value caching and causal cross-level attention to reuse computation, and implements confidence-based gating for adaptive early exits.

Result: Achieves competitive accuracy with significant computational savings through lightweight distillation from a frozen CLIP teacher, enabling dynamic compute-accuracy trade-offs.

Conclusion: WAVECLIP provides an efficient approach for adaptive resolution inference that maintains accuracy while offering substantial computational benefits through wavelet-based tokenization and early exit mechanisms.

Abstract: We introduce WAVECLIP, a single unified model for adaptive resolution
inference in CLIP, enabled by wavelet-based tokenization. WAVECLIP replaces
standard patch embeddings with a multi-level wavelet decomposition, enabling
the model to process images coarse to fine while naturally supporting multiple
resolutions within the same model. At inference time, the model begins with low
resolution tokens and refines only when needed, using key-value caching and
causal cross-level attention to reuse computation, effectively introducing to
the model only new information when needed. We evaluate WAVECLIP in zero-shot
classification, demonstrating that a simple confidence-based gating mechanism
enables adaptive early exits. This allows users to dynamically choose a
compute-accuracy trade-off using a single deployed model. Our approach requires
only lightweight distillation from a frozen CLIP teacher and achieves
competitive accuracy with significant computational savings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Quantization of CLIP models can improve calibration for underconfident models and enhance OOD detection, with specific QAT methods achieving simultaneous gains in accuracy, calibration, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the impact of quantization on CLIP models beyond accuracy, focusing on reliability metrics like calibration and OOD detection, which are crucial for efficient and reliable deployment.

Method: Large-scale evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing in-distribution accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, including analysis of quantization-aware training (QAT) methods.

Result: Quantization improves calibration for underconfident models but may degrade it for overconfident ones; OOD detection can still improve despite calibration issues; specific QAT methods yield gains in accuracy, calibration, and robustness.

Conclusion: Quantization offers benefits beyond efficiency, enabling reliable and robust deployment of VLMs by improving calibration and OOD detection, challenging the traditional efficiency-performance trade-off.

Abstract: The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models
(VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for
the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still
overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance
beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale
evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution
accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing
counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that
quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident
pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants.
Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other
reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these
same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific
quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in
zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a
strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights
for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable,
and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VTU benchmarks use synthetic renderings lacking real-world complexity and visual diversity, and existing datasets offer fixed examples with single visualizations and no access to underlying data for reformulation.

Method: Created TABLET dataset with 4M examples from 2M unique tables (88% preserving original visualizations), including paired image-HTML representations, metadata, and provenance information linking to source datasets. Fine-tuned vision-language models like Qwen2.5-VL-7B on this dataset.

Conclusion: TABLET establishes a foundation for robust training and extensible evaluation of future VTU models by preserving original visualizations and maintaining example traceability in a unified large-scale collection.

Abstract: While table understanding increasingly relies on pixel-only settings where

predominantly use synthetic renderings that lack the complexity and visual
diversity of real-world tables. Additionally, existing visual table
understanding (VTU) datasets offer fixed examples with single visualizations

for reformulation. We introduce TABLET, a large-scale VTU dataset with 4
million examples across 20 tasks, grounded in 2 million unique tables where 88%
preserve original visualizations. Each example includes paired image-HTML
representations, comprehensive metadata, and provenance information linking
back to the source datasets. Fine-tuning vision-language models like
Qwen2.5-VL-7B on TABLET improves performance on seen and unseen VTU tasks while
increasing robustness on real-world table visualizations. By preserving
original visualizations and maintaining example traceability in a unified

extensible evaluation of future VTU models.

*Amr Alkhatib,Stephanie Lowry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A conformal prediction-based approach for controlling explanation fidelity in feature attribution methods, identifying salient feature subsets that preserve model predictions without needing ground-truth explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature attribution methods vary in robustness and may not faithfully reflect black-box model reasoning, requiring better fidelity control.

Method: Proposes four conformity functions to quantify explanation fidelity, identifies salient feature subsets sufficient to preserve predictions, evaluated with five explainers across six image datasets.

Result: FastSHAP outperforms competing methods in fidelity and informational efficiency (explanation region size), super-pixel conformity measures are more effective than pixel-wise ones.

Conclusion: The conformal prediction approach enables direct control over explanation fidelity without ground-truth calibration, with FastSHAP and super-pixel measures showing superior performance.

Abstract: Feature attribution methods are widely used for explaining image-based
predictions, as they provide feature-level insights that can be intuitively
visualized. However, such explanations often vary in their robustness and may
fail to faithfully reflect the reasoning of the underlying black-box model. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel conformal prediction-based
approach that enables users to directly control the fidelity of the generated
explanations. The method identifies a subset of salient features that is
sufficient to preserve the model's prediction, regardless of the information
carried by the excluded features, and without demanding access to ground-truth
explanations for calibration. Four conformity functions are proposed to
quantify the extent to which explanations conform to the model's predictions.
The approach is empirically evaluated using five explainers across six image
datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that FastSHAP consistently
outperforms the competing methods in terms of both fidelity and informational
efficiency, the latter measured by the size of the explanation regions.
Furthermore, the results reveal that conformity measures based on super-pixels
are more effective than their pixel-wise counterparts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hunyuan3D-Omni is a unified framework for fine-grained, controllable 3D asset generation that accepts multiple conditioning signals beyond just images and text, enabling precise control over geometry, topology, and pose.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most current 3D generative models rely primarily on image or text conditioning and lack fine-grained cross-modal controls, which limits controllability and practical adoption in production workflows.

Method: Built on Hunyuan3D 2.1, the framework accepts point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal pose priors as conditioning signals. It uses a single cross-modal architecture instead of separate heads for each modality, trained with a progressive difficulty-aware sampling strategy that biases toward harder signals while downweighting easier ones.

Result: Experiments show that the additional controls improve generation accuracy, enable geometry-aware transformations, and increase robustness for production workflows.

Conclusion: Hunyuan3D-Omni provides a unified solution for fine-grained controllable 3D asset generation that addresses the limitations of current methods by enabling robust multi-modal fusion and graceful handling of missing inputs.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D-native generative models have accelerated asset
creation for games, film, and design. However, most methods still rely
primarily on image or text conditioning and lack fine-grained, cross-modal
controls, which limits controllability and practical adoption. To address this
gap, we present Hunyuan3D-Omni, a unified framework for fine-grained,
controllable 3D asset generation built on Hunyuan3D 2.1. In addition to images,
Hunyuan3D-Omni accepts point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal pose
priors as conditioning signals, enabling precise control over geometry,
topology, and pose. Instead of separate heads for each modality, our model
unifies all signals in a single cross-modal architecture. We train with a
progressive, difficulty-aware sampling strategy that selects one control
modality per example and biases sampling toward harder signals (e.g., skeletal
pose) while downweighting easier ones (e.g., point clouds), encouraging robust
multi-modal fusion and graceful handling of missing inputs. Experiments show
that these additional controls improve generation accuracy, enable
geometry-aware transformations, and increase robustness for production
workflows.

*Muxin Pu,Mei Kuan Lim,Chun Yong Chong,Chen Change Loy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sigma is a unified skeleton-based sign language understanding framework that addresses semantic grounding, local-global balance, and cross-modal learning challenges through sign-aware early fusion, hierarchical alignment, and unified pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SLU methods face three key limitations: weak semantic grounding (struggling to relate skeletal motion patterns to linguistic meaning), imbalance between local details and global context, and inefficient cross-modal learning for constructing semantically aligned representations across modalities.

Method: Proposes Sigma framework with: 1) sign-aware early fusion mechanism for deep visual-textual interaction, 2) hierarchical alignment learning strategy to maximize agreements across different feature levels, and 3) unified pre-training combining contrastive learning, text matching, and language modeling.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art results on isolated sign language recognition, continuous sign language recognition, and gloss-free sign language translation across multiple benchmarks spanning different sign and spoken languages.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the impact of semantically informative pre-training and the effectiveness of skeletal data as a stand-alone solution for SLU, showing that skeleton-based methods can robustly handle variations without appearance or environmental factors.

Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective for learning transferable features in sign
language understanding (SLU) tasks. Recently, skeleton-based methods have
gained increasing attention because they can robustly handle variations in
subjects and backgrounds without being affected by appearance or environmental
factors. Current SLU methods continue to face three key limitations: 1) weak
semantic grounding, as models often capture low-level motion patterns from
skeletal data but struggle to relate them to linguistic meaning; 2) imbalance
between local details and global context, with models either focusing too
narrowly on fine-grained cues or overlooking them for broader context; and 3)
inefficient cross-modal learning, as constructing semantically aligned
representations across modalities remains difficult. To address these, we
propose Sigma, a unified skeleton-based SLU framework featuring: 1) a
sign-aware early fusion mechanism that facilitates deep interaction between
visual and textual modalities, enriching visual features with linguistic
context; 2) a hierarchical alignment learning strategy that jointly maximises
agreements across different levels of paired features from different
modalities, effectively capturing both fine-grained details and high-level
semantic relationships; and 3) a unified pre-training framework that combines
contrastive learning, text matching and language modelling to promote semantic
consistency and generalisation. Sigma achieves new state-of-the-art results on
isolated sign language recognition, continuous sign language recognition, and
gloss-free sign language translation on multiple benchmarks spanning different
sign and spoken languages, demonstrating the impact of semantically informative
pre-training and the effectiveness of skeletal data as a stand-alone solution
for SLU.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework using vision-language models to automatically generate semantic attention maps via natural language prompts, eliminating need for manual annotations while improving CNN reliability and cognitive plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs often exploit superficial correlations rather than making predictions for the right reasons, and existing methods require labor-intensive expert annotations which limit scalability.

Method: Leverage vision-language models to automatically generate semantic attention maps using natural language prompts, then introduce an auxiliary loss that aligns CNN attention with these language-guided maps.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ColorMNIST and remains competitive with annotation-heavy baselines on DecoyMNIST, demonstrating improved generalization, reduced shortcut reliance, and more human-intuitive attention patterns.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a scalable solution for promoting reliable and cognitively plausible decision-making in CNNs without requiring manual annotation, addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) frequently "cheat" by exploiting
superficial correlations, raising concerns about whether they make predictions
for the right reasons. Inspired by cognitive science, which highlights the role
of attention in robust human perception, recent methods have sought to guide
model attention using concept-based supervision and explanation regularization.
However, these techniques depend on labor-intensive, expert-provided
annotations, limiting their scalability. We propose a scalable framework that
leverages vision-language models to automatically generate semantic attention
maps using natural language prompts. By introducing an auxiliary loss that
aligns CNN attention with these language-guided maps, our approach promotes
more reliable and cognitively plausible decision-making without manual
annotation. Experiments on challenging datasets, ColoredMNIST and DecoyMNIST,
show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ColorMNIST and
remains competitive with annotation-heavy baselines on DecoyMNIST,
demonstrating improved generalization, reduced shortcut reliance, and model
attention that better reflects human intuition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a comprehensive study evaluating how well automated metrics for compositional text-image generation align with human judgments, finding that no single metric performs consistently across different types of compositional challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation in text-image generation relies heavily on automated metrics that are often adopted by convention rather than being validated against human judgment, making it critical to understand how well these metrics reflect human preferences for trustworthy evaluation and progress reporting.

Method: The authors conducted a broad study examining widely used metrics for compositional text-image evaluation, going beyond simple correlation to analyze their behavior across diverse compositional challenges and comparing how different metric families align with human judgments.

Result: Results show that no single metric performs consistently across tasks, with performance varying by compositional problem type. VQA-based metrics are not uniformly superior despite their popularity, while certain embedding-based metrics prove stronger in specific cases. Image-only metrics contribute little to compositional evaluation as they focus on perceptual quality rather than alignment.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the importance of careful and transparent metric selection for trustworthy evaluation and their use as reward models in generation, highlighting that metric performance is task-dependent rather than universally applicable.

Abstract: Text-image generation has advanced rapidly, but assessing whether outputs
truly capture the objects, attributes, and relations described in prompts
remains a central challenge. Evaluation in this space relies heavily on
automated metrics, yet these are often adopted by convention or popularity
rather than validated against human judgment. Because evaluation and reported
progress in the field depend directly on these metrics, it is critical to
understand how well they reflect human preferences. To address this, we present
a broad study of widely used metrics for compositional text-image evaluation.
Our analysis goes beyond simple correlation, examining their behavior across
diverse compositional challenges and comparing how different metric families
align with human judgments. The results show that no single metric performs
consistently across tasks: performance varies with the type of compositional
problem. Notably, VQA-based metrics, though popular, are not uniformly
superior, while certain embedding-based metrics prove stronger in specific
cases. Image-only metrics, as expected, contribute little to compositional
evaluation, as they are designed for perceptual quality rather than alignment.
These findings underscore the importance of careful and transparent metric
selection, both for trustworthy evaluation and for their use as reward models
in generation. Project page is available at

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a critical medical imaging modality in
clinical diagnosis and research, yet its complexity and heterogeneity pose
challenges for automated analysis, particularly in scalable and generalizable

TL;DR: SlideMamba integrates Mamba architecture with Graph Neural Networks using entropy-based adaptive fusion to enhance Whole Slide Image analysis, achieving superior performance in predicting gene fusion and mutation status compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a generalizable deep learning framework that captures both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies in Whole Slide Images for improved computational pathology analysis.

Method: Combines Mamba modules for long-range global dependencies and GNNs for fine-grained short-range spatial interactions, with an entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism for adaptive fusion of complementary signals.

Result: Achieved PRAUC of 0.751 ± 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491), Trans-MIL (0.39), Mamba-only (0.664), GNN-only (0.748), and GAT-Mamba (0.703), with competitive ROC AUC (0.738), sensitivity (0.662), and specificity (0.725).

Conclusion: The integrated architecture with entropy-based adaptive fusion demonstrates strong performance and promising potential for spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.

Abstract: Advances in computational pathology increasingly rely on extracting
meaningful representations from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to support various
clinical and biological tasks. In this study, we propose a generalizable deep
learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture
both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies,
offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules
excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize
fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these
complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an
entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically
balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the
branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the
contextual importance of local versus global information for different
downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a
representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our
framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve
(PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39
\pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a
prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves
competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm
0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength
of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive
fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of
spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.

TL;DR: SQ-InstructBLIP improves vision-language reasoning by generating image-aware sub-questions and answers through a modular architecture, outperforming previous methods on VQA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models struggle with multi-step reasoning tasks due to limitations in accessing fine-grained visual content and the black-box nature of LLMs, which hinders reproducibility and effectiveness.

Method: Proposes SQ-InstructBLIP with three components (Questioner, Answerer, Reasoner) that share the same architecture. The Questioner generates sub-questions, the Answerer provides sub-answers, and the Reasoner uses this information to solve the main question through iterative reasoning.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that SQ-InstructBLIP achieves more accurate reasoning on VQA tasks compared to previous methods by leveraging generated sub-questions as additional context.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses limitations of existing approaches by enabling image-aware, iterative sub-question generation, leading to improved performance in complex vision-language reasoning tasks.

Abstract: The field of vision-language understanding has been actively researched in
recent years, thanks to the development of Large Language Models~(LLMs).
However, it still needs help with problems requiring multi-step reasoning, even
for very simple questions. Recent studies adopt LLMs to tackle this problem by
iteratively generating sub-questions and answers. However, there are
disadvantages such as 1) the fine-grained visual contents of images are not
available using LLMs that cannot read visual information, 2) internal
mechanisms are inaccessible and difficult to reproduce by using black-box LLMs.
To solve these problems, we propose the SQ (Self-Questioning)-InstructBLIP,
which improves inference performance by generating image-aware informative
sub-questions and sub-answers iteratively. The SQ-InstructBLIP, which consists
of a Questioner, Answerer, and Reasoner that share the same architecture.
Questioner and Answerer generate sub-questions and sub-answers to help infer
the main-question, and Reasoner performs reasoning on the main-question
considering the generated sub-question information. Our experiments show that
the proposed method SQ-InstructBLIP, which uses the generated sub-questions as
additional information when solving the VQA task, performs more accurate
reasoning than the previous works.

TL;DR: MedVSR is a novel framework for medical video super-resolution that addresses unique challenges in medical videos like camera shake, noise, and abrupt frame transitions through Cross State-Space Propagation for alignment and Inner State-Space Reconstruction for artifact reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution medical videos are crucial for accurate diagnosis but hard to acquire due to hardware limitations. Current VSR models struggle with medical video challenges including camera shake, noise, abrupt frame transitions, and tend to introduce artifacts that can mislead doctors.

Method: Proposes MedVSR with two key components: Cross State-Space Propagation (CSSP) for precise alignment by projecting distant frames as control matrices, and Inner State-Space Reconstruction (ISSR) for enhancing tissue structures through joint long-range spatial feature learning and large-kernel short-range information aggregation.

Result: Experiments across four medical datasets (including endoscopy and cataract surgeries) show MedVSR significantly outperforms existing VSR models in both reconstruction performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: MedVSR provides an effective solution for medical video super-resolution, successfully addressing the unique challenges in medical videos while improving reconstruction quality and reducing artifacts that could mislead clinical diagnosis.

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) medical videos are vital for accurate diagnosis, yet are
hard to acquire due to hardware limitations and physiological constraints.
Clinically, the collected low-resolution (LR) medical videos present unique
challenges for video super-resolution (VSR) models, including camera shake,
noise, and abrupt frame transitions, which result in significant optical flow
errors and alignment difficulties. Additionally, tissues and organs exhibit
continuous and nuanced structures, but current VSR models are prone to
introducing artifacts and distorted features that can mislead doctors. To this
end, we propose MedVSR, a tailored framework for medical VSR. It first employs
Cross State-Space Propagation (CSSP) to address the imprecise alignment by
projecting distant frames as control matrices within state-space models,
enabling the selective propagation of consistent and informative features to
neighboring frames for effective alignment. Moreover, we design an Inner
State-Space Reconstruction (ISSR) module that enhances tissue structures and
reduces artifacts with joint long-range spatial feature learning and
large-kernel short-range information aggregation. Experiments across four
datasets in diverse medical scenarios, including endoscopy and cataract
surgeries, show that MedVSR significantly outperforms existing VSR models in
reconstruction performance and efficiency. Code released at

TL;DR: SHINE is a training-free framework for seamless image composition that leverages pretrained diffusion models to handle complex lighting and high-resolution inputs without requiring latent inversion or attention surgery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image composition models struggle with complex lighting conditions (accurate shadows, water reflections) and diverse high-resolution inputs. While modern diffusion models encode essential physical and resolution priors, they lack a framework to utilize these capabilities effectively without problematic techniques like latent inversion.

Method: SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss using pretrained customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject representation while preserving background integrity. It also employs degradation-suppression guidance and adaptive background blending to eliminate low-quality outputs and visible seams.

Result: Experiments on the proposed ComplexCompo benchmark and DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward).

Conclusion: SHINE provides an effective training-free solution for high-fidelity image composition that addresses complex lighting challenges and high-resolution inputs while outperforming existing methods on rigorous benchmarks.

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert a user-specified object into a
new scene, but existing models struggle with complex lighting (e.g., accurate
shadows, water reflections) and diverse, high-resolution inputs. Modern
text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX) already encode essential
physical and resolution priors, yet lack a framework to unleash them without
resorting to latent inversion, which often locks object poses into contextually
inappropriate orientations, or brittle attention surgery. We propose SHINE, a
training-free framework for Seamless, High-fidelity Insertion with Neutralized
Errors. SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss, leveraging pretrained
customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject
representation while preserving background integrity. Degradation-suppression
guidance and adaptive background blending are proposed to further eliminate
low-quality outputs and visible seams. To address the lack of rigorous
benchmarks, we introduce ComplexCompo, featuring diverse resolutions and
challenging conditions such as low lighting, strong illumination, intricate
shadows, and reflective surfaces. Experiments on ComplexCompo and
DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (e.g.,
DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (e.g., DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a formal definition and taxonomy for hallucination in text-to-image (T2I) generative models, categorizing it as bias-driven deviations into attribute, relation, and object hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucination has been studied in language and vision-language models but not clearly framed for T2I models. Existing evaluations focus only on alignment with prompt elements, overlooking what models generate beyond the prompt.

Method: The authors argue for defining T2I hallucination as bias-driven deviations and propose a taxonomy with three categories: attribute hallucinations, relation hallucinations, and object hallucinations.

Result: This framing establishes an upper bound for evaluation and reveals hidden biases in T2I models.

Conclusion: The proposed taxonomy provides a foundation for richer assessment of T2I generative models by systematically addressing hallucination beyond simple prompt alignment.

Abstract: In language and vision-language models, hallucination is broadly understood
as content generated from a model's prior knowledge or biases rather than from
the given input. While this phenomenon has been studied in those domains, it
has not been clearly framed for text-to-image (T2I) generative models. Existing
evaluations mainly focus on alignment, checking whether prompt-specified
elements appear, but overlook what the model generates beyond the prompt. We
argue for defining hallucination in T2I as bias-driven deviations and propose a
taxonomy with three categories: attribute, relation, and object hallucinations.
This framing introduces an upper bound for evaluation and surfaces hidden
biases, providing a foundation for richer assessment of T2I models.

TL;DR: Proposes a Person Independence Universal Micro-action Recognition Framework using Distributionally Robust Optimization to handle inter-person variability in micro-action recognition, with temporal-frequency alignment and group-invariant regularization components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing micro-action recognition methods fail in real-world scenarios due to inter-person variability causing the same action to manifest differently, hindering robust generalization.

Method: Two plug-and-play components: 1) Temporal-Frequency Alignment Module with dual-branch design (temporal branch uses Wasserstein-regularized alignment, frequency branch uses variance-guided perturbations) with consistency-driven fusion; 2) Group-Invariant Regularized Loss that partitions samples into pseudo-groups, up-weights boundary cases, and regularizes subgroup variance.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on MA-52 dataset in both accuracy and robustness, achieving stable generalization under fine-grained conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses person-specific variations in micro-action recognition through distributionally robust optimization principles, enabling robust generalization across different individuals.

Abstract: Micro-action Recognition is vital for psychological assessment and
human-computer interaction. However, existing methods often fail in real-world
scenarios because inter-person variability causes the same action to manifest
differently, hindering robust generalization. To address this, we propose the
Person Independence Universal Micro-action Recognition Framework, which
integrates Distributionally Robust Optimization principles to learn
person-agnostic representations. Our framework contains two plug-and-play
components operating at the feature and loss levels. At the feature level, the
Temporal-Frequency Alignment Module normalizes person-specific motion
characteristics with a dual-branch design: the temporal branch applies
Wasserstein-regularized alignment to stabilize dynamic trajectories, while the
frequency branch introduces variance-guided perturbations to enhance robustness
against person-specific spectral differences. A consistency-driven fusion
mechanism integrates both branches. At the loss level, the Group-Invariant
Regularized Loss partitions samples into pseudo-groups to simulate unseen
person-specific distributions. By up-weighting boundary cases and regularizing
subgroup variance, it forces the model to generalize beyond easy or frequent
samples, thus enhancing robustness to difficult variations. Experiments on the
large-scale MA-52 dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing

### [82] [Dense Semantic Matching with VGGT Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21263)
*Songlin Yang,Tianyi Wei,Yushi Lan,Zeqi Xiao,Anyi Rao,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel approach for semantic matching that addresses geometric ambiguity and nearest-neighbor rule limitations by adapting 3D geometric foundation model VGGT for cross-instance semantic matching through strategic fine-tuning and data-efficient training strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic matching approaches suffer from geometric ambiguity (failing to disambiguate symmetric structures using 2D features) and limitations of the nearest-neighbor rule (ignoring cross-image invisibility and manifold preservation). These challenges require geometry-aware descriptors and holistic dense correspondence mechanisms.

Method: The approach adapts VGGT (a 3D geometric foundation model) for semantic matching by: (i) reusing early feature stages, fine-tuning later ones, and adding a semantic head for bidirectional correspondences; (ii) implementing cycle-consistent training strategy, synthetic data augmentation, and progressive training with aliasing artifact mitigation to address data scarcity.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior geometry awareness, matching reliability, and manifold preservation, outperforming previous baselines in semantic matching tasks.

Conclusion: The method successfully bridges the gap between 3D geometric foundation models and semantic matching requirements, providing an effective solution that overcomes the limitations of existing 2D-based approaches while maintaining strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Semantic matching aims to establish pixel-level correspondences between
instances of the same category and represents a fundamental task in computer
vision. Existing approaches suffer from two limitations: (i) Geometric
Ambiguity: Their reliance on 2D foundation model features (e.g., Stable
Diffusion, DINO) often fails to disambiguate symmetric structures, requiring
extra fine-tuning yet lacking generalization; (ii) Nearest-Neighbor Rule: Their
pixel-wise matching ignores cross-image invisibility and neglects manifold
preservation. These challenges call for geometry-aware pixel descriptors and
holistic dense correspondence mechanisms. Inspired by recent advances in 3D
geometric foundation models, we turn to VGGT, which provides geometry-grounded
features and holistic dense matching capabilities well aligned with these
needs. However, directly transferring VGGT is challenging, as it was originally
designed for geometry matching within cross views of a single instance,
misaligned with cross-instance semantic matching, and further hindered by the
scarcity of dense semantic annotations. To address this, we propose an approach
that (i) retains VGGT's intrinsic strengths by reusing early feature stages,
fine-tuning later ones, and adding a semantic head for bidirectional
correspondences; and (ii) adapts VGGT to the semantic matching scenario under
data scarcity through cycle-consistent training strategy, synthetic data
augmentation, and progressive training recipe with aliasing artifact
mitigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior geometry awareness, matching reliability, and manifold preservation,
outperforming previous baselines.

### [83] [MMR1: Enhancing Multimodal Reasoning with Variance-Aware Sampling and Open Resources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21268)
*Sicong Leng,Jing Wang,Jiaxi Li,Hao Zhang,Zhiqiang Hu,Boqiang Zhang,Yuming Jiang,Hang Zhang,Xin Li,Lidong Bing,Deli Zhao,Wei Lu,Yu Rong,Aixin Sun,Shijian Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS) to stabilize RL fine-tuning in multimodal reasoning models, releases large-scale curated chain-of-thought data, and open-sources multimodal reasoning models with demonstrated effectiveness on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address two major limitations in large multimodal reasoning models: lack of open, high-quality long chain-of-thought data and instability of RL algorithms in post-training due to gradient vanishing when reward variance is low.

Method: Proposes Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS) guided by Variance Promotion Score (VPS) that combines outcome variance and trajectory diversity to promote reward variance and stabilize policy optimization. Also releases curated datasets and training codebase.

Result: Experiments across mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate effectiveness of both curated data and VAS. Theoretically establishes that reward variance lower-bounds expected policy gradient magnitude.

Conclusion: The proposed VAS method effectively stabilizes RL fine-tuning, and the released resources (data, models, code) establish standardized baselines for the multimodal reasoning community.

Abstract: Large multimodal reasoning models have achieved rapid progress, but their
advancement is constrained by two major limitations: the absence of open,
large-scale, high-quality long chain-of-thought (CoT) data, and the instability
of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in post-training. Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), the standard framework for RL fine-tuning, is prone
to gradient vanishing when reward variance is low, which weakens optimization
signals and impairs convergence. This work makes three contributions: (1) We
propose Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS), a data selection strategy guided by
Variance Promotion Score (VPS) that combines outcome variance and trajectory
diversity to promote reward variance and stabilize policy optimization. (2) We
release large-scale, carefully curated resources containing ~1.6M long CoT
cold-start data and ~15k RL QA pairs, designed to ensure quality, difficulty,
and diversity, along with a fully reproducible end-to-end training codebase.
(3) We open-source a family of multimodal reasoning models in multiple scales,
establishing standardized baselines for the community. Experiments across
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both the
curated data and the proposed VAS. Comprehensive ablation studies and analyses
provide further insight into the contributions of each component. In addition,
we theoretically establish that reward variance lower-bounds the expected
policy gradient magnitude, with VAS serving as a practical mechanism to realize
this guarantee. Our code, data, and checkpoints are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new foundation model using Prithvi-EO Vision Transformer architecture was pre-trained on Sentinel-3 OLCI data and fine-tuned for marine monitoring tasks, showing improved performance in chlorophyll concentration quantification and ocean primary production estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models pre-trained on massive unlabelled datasets can overcome the challenge of sparse and expensive labelled data in ocean science, potentially revolutionizing AI applications in marine monitoring.

Method: Used Prithvi-EO Vision Transformer architecture pre-trained to reconstruct Sentinel-3 OLCI data, then fine-tuned on downstream tasks including chlorophyll concentration quantification and ocean primary production estimation.

Result: The model demonstrated utility for marine monitoring, effectively using small amounts of high-quality labelled data and capturing detailed spatial patterns of ocean color while matching point observations.

Conclusion: This new generation of geospatial AI models has potential to provide more robust, data-driven insights into ocean ecosystems and their role in global climate processes.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Foundation models (FMs), pre-trained on massive
unlabelled datasets, have the potential to drastically change AI applications
in ocean science, where labelled data are often sparse and expensive to
collect. In this work, we describe a new foundation model using the Prithvi-EO
Vision Transformer architecture which has been pre-trained to reconstruct data
from the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). We evaluate the
model by fine-tuning on two downstream marine earth observation tasks. We first
assess model performance compared to current baseline models used to quantify
chlorophyll concentration. We then evaluate the FMs ability to refine remote
sensing-based estimates of ocean primary production. Our results demonstrate
the utility of self-trained FMs for marine monitoring, in particular for making
use of small amounts of high quality labelled data and in capturing detailed
spatial patterns of ocean colour whilst matching point observations. We
conclude that this new generation of geospatial AI models has the potential to
provide more robust, data-driven insights into ocean ecosystems and their role
in global climate processes.

*Weilun Feng,Haotong Qin,Mingqiang Wu,Chuanguang Yang,Yuqi Li,Xiangqi Li,Zhulin An,Libo Huang,Yulun Zhang,Michele Magno,Yongjun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuantVGGT is a novel quantization framework for Visual Geometry Grounded Transformers (VGGTs) that addresses challenges in compressing billion-scale 3D reconstruction models through dual-smoothed fine-grained quantization and noise-filtered diverse sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning-based 3D reconstruction models like VGGTs face prohibitive computational and memory costs that hinder real-world deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) encounters unique obstacles with billion-scale VGGTs due to heavy-tailed activation distributions from data-independent special tokens and unstable calibration from multi-view 3D data.

Method: QuantVGGT introduces two key techniques: 1) Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained Quantization that combines pre-global Hadamard rotation and post-local channel smoothing to handle heavy-tailed distributions and inter-channel variance, and 2) Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling that filters outliers using deep-layer statistics and creates frame-aware diverse calibration clusters for stable quantization ranges.

Result: QuantVGGT achieves state-of-the-art results across different benchmarks and bit-widths, significantly outperforming previous generic quantization methods. The 4-bit QuantVGGT delivers 3.7× memory reduction and 2.5× acceleration in real-hardware inference while maintaining reconstruction accuracy above 98% of the full-precision counterpart.

Conclusion: QuantVGGT demonstrates significant advantages and practicality for resource-constrained scenarios, enabling efficient deployment of large-scale 3D reconstruction transformers with minimal accuracy loss.

Abstract: Learning-based 3D reconstruction models, represented by Visual Geometry
Grounded Transformers (VGGTs), have made remarkable progress with the use of
large-scale transformers. Their prohibitive computational and memory costs
severely hinder real-world deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has
become a common practice for compressing and accelerating models. However, we
empirically observe that PTQ faces unique obstacles when compressing
billion-scale VGGTs: the data-independent special tokens induce heavy-tailed
activation distributions, while the multi-view nature of 3D data makes
calibration sample selection highly unstable. This paper proposes the first
Quantization framework for VGGTs, namely QuantVGGT. This mainly relies on two
technical contributions: First, we introduce Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained
Quantization, which integrates pre-global Hadamard rotation and post-local
channel smoothing to mitigate heavy-tailed distributions and inter-channel
variance robustly. Second, we design Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling, which
filters outliers via deep-layer statistics and constructs frame-aware diverse
calibration clusters to ensure stable quantization ranges. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that QuantVGGT achieves the state-of-the-art results
across different benchmarks and bit-width, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art generic quantization method with a great margin. We highlight
that our 4-bit QuantVGGT can deliver a 3.7$\times$ memory reduction and
2.5$\times$ acceleration in real-hardware inference, while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy above 98\% of its full-precision counterpart. This
demonstrates the vast advantages and practicality of QuantVGGT in
resource-constrained scenarios. Our code is released in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NewtonGen is a framework that integrates data-driven synthesis with learnable physical principles to address physical inconsistency in text-to-video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video models produce unrealistic motions and lack precise parameter control due to learning motion distributions solely from appearance without understanding underlying dynamics.

Method: Proposes trainable Neural Newtonian Dynamics (NND) that models Newtonian motions and injects latent dynamical constraints into video generation, combining data priors with dynamical guidance.

Result: Enables physically consistent video synthesis with precise parameter control by jointly leveraging data-driven synthesis and physical principles.

Conclusion: NewtonGen addresses fundamental limitations in text-to-video generation by incorporating learnable physical dynamics, improving physical consistency and controllability.

Abstract: A primary bottleneck in large-scale text-to-video generation today is
physical consistency and controllability. Despite recent advances,
state-of-the-art models often produce unrealistic motions, such as objects
falling upward, or abrupt changes in velocity and direction. Moreover, these
models lack precise parameter control, struggling to generate physically
consistent dynamics under different initial conditions. We argue that this
fundamental limitation stems from current models learning motion distributions
solely from appearance, while lacking an understanding of the underlying
dynamics. In this work, we propose NewtonGen, a framework that integrates
data-driven synthesis with learnable physical principles. At its core lies
trainable Neural Newtonian Dynamics (NND), which can model and predict a
variety of Newtonian motions, thereby injecting latent dynamical constraints
into the video generation process. By jointly leveraging data priors and
dynamical guidance, NewtonGen enables physically consistent video synthesis
with precise parameter control.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation of LiDAR data is challenging with diverse sensor types, but incorporating semantic information can significantly improve the accuracy and robustness of LiDAR-based localization for autonomous mobile systems.

Method: Projects LiDAR points into the semantic segmentation space of camera images using Depth-Anything network for camera segmentation and an adaptive segmentation network for LiDAR. Validated on CoCar NextGen platform with 55 km drive through diverse environments using GNSS-RTK as ground truth.

Result: The approach enhances precision and reliability of LiDAR-based localization pipeline by leveraging semantic information from camera data.

Conclusion: This multimodal approach paves the way for more reliable and precise autonomous navigation systems in complex real-world environments.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of LiDAR data presents considerable challenges,
particularly when dealing with diverse sensor types and configurations.
However, incorporating semantic information can significantly enhance the
accuracy and robustness of LiDAR-based localization techniques for autonomous
mobile systems. We propose an approach that integrates semantic camera data
with LiDAR segmentation to address this challenge. By projecting LiDAR points
into the semantic segmentation space of the camera, our method enhances the
precision and reliability of the LiDAR-based localization pipeline.
  For validation, we utilize the CoCar NextGen platform from the FZI Research
Center for Information Technology, which offers diverse sensor modalities and
configurations. The sensor setup of CoCar NextGen enables a thorough analysis
of different sensor types. Our evaluation leverages the state-of-the-art
Depth-Anything network for camera image segmentation and an adaptive
segmentation network for LiDAR segmentation. To establish a reliable ground
truth for LiDAR-based localization, we make us of a Global Navigation Satellite
System (GNSS) solution with Real-Time Kinematic corrections (RTK).
Additionally, we conduct an extensive 55 km drive through the city of
Karlsruhe, Germany, covering a variety of environments, including urban areas,
multi-lane roads, and rural highways. This multimodal approach paves the way
for more reliable and precise autonomous navigation systems, particularly in
complex real-world environments.

TL;DR: A zero-shot framework for vision-language navigation in continuous environments that combines a waypoint predictor with multimodal LLM reasoning over topological graphs, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenging problem of VLN in continuous environments where agents must interpret language instructions, perceive surroundings, and plan actions simultaneously.

Method: Integrates a simplified waypoint predictor operating on obstacle maps with MLLM reasoning over dynamically updated topological graphs containing visitation records and spatial structure.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance with 41% success rate on R2R-CE and 36% on RxR-CE, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enables exploration and error correction through spatial reasoning and history tracking, demonstrating strong zero-shot VLN capabilities.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of foundation models and robotics, vision-language
navigation (VLN) has emerged as a key task for embodied agents with broad
practical applications. We address VLN in continuous environments, a
particularly challenging setting where an agent must jointly interpret natural
language instructions, perceive its surroundings, and plan low-level actions.
We propose a zero-shot framework that integrates a simplified yet effective
waypoint predictor with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). The predictor
operates on an abstract obstacle map, producing linearly reachable waypoints,
which are incorporated into a dynamically updated topological graph with
explicit visitation records. The graph and visitation information are encoded
into the prompt, enabling reasoning over both spatial structure and exploration
history to encourage exploration and equip MLLM with local path planning for
error correction. Extensive experiments on R2R-CE and RxR-CE show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, with success rates of
41% and 36%, respectively, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MELEGROS is a monolithic elephant-inspired soft gripper with integrated optical sensors, created through single-material 3D printing that combines sensing, actuation, and structure in one continuous fabrication process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a bioinspired soft gripper that seamlessly integrates sensing, actuation, and structure like an elephant trunk, eliminating mechanical mismatches and enabling simulation-guided design.

Method: Used single soft resin and continuous 3D printing to integrate six optical waveguide sensors and five pneumatic chambers into a pneumatically actuated lattice structure (12.5 mm cell size), requiring only four design iterations.

Result: The 132g gripper lifts more than twice its weight, performs bioinspired actions (pinching, scooping, reaching), grasps fragile items, and provides distinct sensor responses to touch, bending, and chamber deformation.

Conclusion: MELEGROS demonstrates a new paradigm for soft robotics with fully embedded sensing and continuous structures that support versatile, bioinspired manipulation.

Abstract: The elephant trunk exemplifies a natural gripper where structure, actuation,
and sensing are seamlessly integrated. Inspired by the distal morphology of the
African elephant trunk, we present MELEGROS, a Monolithic ELEphant-inspired
GRipper with Optical Sensors, emphasizing sensing as an intrinsic,
co-fabricated capability. Unlike multi-material or tendon-based approaches,
MELEGROS directly integrates six optical waveguide sensors and five pneumatic
chambers into a pneumatically actuated lattice structure (12.5 mm cell size)
using a single soft resin and one continuous 3D print. This eliminates
mechanical mismatches between sensors, actuators, and body, reducing model
uncertainty and enabling simulation-guided sensor design and placement. Only
four iterations were required to achieve the final prototype, which features a
continuous structure capable of elongation, compression, and bending while
decoupling tactile and proprioceptive signals. MELEGROS (132 g) lifts more than
twice its weight, performs bioinspired actions such as pinching, scooping, and
reaching, and delicately grasps fragile items like grapes. The integrated
optical sensors provide distinct responses to touch, bending, and chamber
deformation, enabling multifunctional perception. MELEGROS demonstrates a new
paradigm for soft robotics where fully embedded sensing and continuous
structures inherently support versatile, bioinspired manipulation.

*Prasanna Sriganesh,Barath Satheeshkumar,Anushree Sabnis,Matthew Travers*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A perception-action framework for quadrupedal robots to push objects in cluttered environments while maintaining stability, using proprioceptive feedback to track objects during occlusion and learn from physical interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable robots to safely clear paths in densely cluttered environments like staircases by addressing the challenge of object occlusion during one-legged pushing maneuvers where objects become hidden from sensors during manipulation.

Method: Interaction-aware state estimation loop using proprioceptive feedback (foot contact and leg position) to predict object displacement during occlusion, guiding perception system to re-detect objects after interaction, and learning from physical outcomes to reclassify objects as immovable if pushes fail.

Result: Implementation on Boston Dynamics Spot robot shows higher task success rates and tracking accuracy in pushing objects on stairs compared to open-loop baselines.

Conclusion: The tightly coupled perception-action framework enables robust object manipulation in cluttered environments by closing the loop between action and sensing, allowing robots to adapt to physical constraints and learn from interaction outcomes.

Abstract: For robots to operate autonomously in densely cluttered environments, they
must reason about and potentially physically interact with obstacles to clear a
path. Safely clearing a path on challenging terrain, such as a cluttered
staircase, requires controlled interaction. For example, a quadrupedal robot
that pushes objects out of the way with one leg while maintaining a stable
stance with its three other legs. However, tightly coupled physical actions,
such as one-legged pushing, create new constraints on the system that can be
difficult to predict at design time. In this work, we present a new method that
addresses one such constraint, wherein the object being pushed by a quadrupedal
robot with one of its legs becomes occluded from the robot's sensors during
manipulation. To address this challenge, we present a tightly coupled
perception-action framework that enables the robot to perceive clutter, reason
about feasible push paths, and execute the clearing maneuver. Our core
contribution is an interaction-aware state estimation loop that uses
proprioceptive feedback regarding foot contact and leg position to predict an
object's displacement during the occlusion. This prediction guides the
perception system to robustly re-detect the object after the interaction,
closing the loop between action and sensing to enable accurate tracking even
after partial pushes. Using this feedback allows the robot to learn from
physical outcomes, reclassifying an object as immovable if a push fails due to
it being too heavy. We present results of implementing our approach on a Boston
Dynamics Spot robot that show our interaction-aware approach achieves higher
task success rates and tracking accuracy in pushing objects on stairs compared
to open-loop baselines.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPARQ is a progress-aware query policy for human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning that reduces human feedback by only requesting it when learning stagnates or worsens, achieving near-perfect performance with half the feedback budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human feedback is costly and limited in real-world robot learning settings, but existing HiL-RL methods assume abundant feedback, limiting their practicality for physical robot deployment.

Method: SPARQ uses a progress-aware query policy that monitors learning progress and only requests human feedback when learning stagnates or worsens, avoiding unnecessary oracle calls.

Result: SPARQ achieves near-perfect task success matching always-querying performance while using about half the feedback budget, and provides more stable and efficient learning than random querying.

Conclusion: Selective, progress-based query strategies like SPARQ can make HiL-RL more efficient and scalable for robots operating under realistic human effort constraints.

Abstract: Human feedback can greatly accelerate robot learning, but in real-world
settings, such feedback is costly and limited. Existing human-in-the-loop
reinforcement learning (HiL-RL) methods often assume abundant feedback,
limiting their practicality for physical robot deployment. In this work, we
introduce SPARQ, a progress-aware query policy that requests feedback only when
learning stagnates or worsens, thereby reducing unnecessary oracle calls. We
evaluate SPARQ on a simulated UR5 cube-picking task in PyBullet, comparing
against three baselines: no feedback, random querying, and always querying. Our
experiments show that SPARQ achieves near-perfect task success, matching the
performance of always querying while consuming about half the feedback budget.
It also provides more stable and efficient learning than random querying, and
significantly improves over training without feedback. These findings suggest
that selective, progress-based query strategies can make HiL-RL more efficient
and scalable for robots operating under realistic human effort constraints.

Conclusion: GraspFactory provides a comprehensive dataset that enables training of robust robotic grasping models capable of handling diverse objects in industrial automation environments, with the dataset and tools made publicly available.

Abstract: Robotic grasping is a crucial task in industrial automation, where robots are
increasingly expected to handle a wide range of objects. However, a significant
challenge arises when robot grasping models trained on limited datasets
encounter novel objects. In real-world environments such as warehouses or
manufacturing plants, the diversity of objects can be vast, and grasping models
need to generalize to this diversity. Training large, generalizable
robot-grasping models requires geometrically diverse datasets. In this paper,
we introduce GraspFactory, a dataset containing over 109 million 6-DoF grasps
collectively for the Franka Panda (with 14,690 objects) and Robotiq 2F-85
grippers (with 33,710 objects). GraspFactory is designed for training

Motivation: To develop autonomous environmental monitoring capabilities for rapid response to marine pollution incidents by enabling unmanned surface vehicles to reliably identify pollution sources.

Method: Integrates high-fidelity marine pollution dispersion simulation with informative path planning techniques, implemented in ROS to process real-time sensor data and update probabilistic source location estimates while quantifying uncertainty.

Result: Experiments in simulated environments show the framework can localize pollution sources with high accuracy and efficiency across varying source locations, flow conditions, and starting positions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach contributes to developing full autonomous environmental monitoring capabilities essential for rapid marine pollution response, demonstrating reliable and efficient source localization.

Abstract: This paper proposes an uncertainty-aware marine pollution source tracking
framework for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). By integrating high-fidelity
marine pollution dispersion simulation with informative path planning
techniques, we demonstrate effective identification of pollution sources in
marine environments. The proposed approach is implemented based on Robot

probabilistic source location estimates. The system progressively refines the
estimation of source location while quantifying uncertainty levels in its
predictions. Experiments conducted in simulated environments with varying
source locations, flow conditions, and starting positions demonstrate the
framework's ability to localise pollution sources with high accuracy. Results
show that the proposed approach achieves reliable source localisation
efficiently. This work contributes to the development of full autonomous
environmental monitoring capabilities essential for rapid response to marine

*Satyajeet Das,Darren Chiu,Zhehui Huang,Lars Lindemann,Gaurav S. Sukhatme*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Latent Activation Editing (LAE) is a framework that improves safety of pre-trained reinforcement learning policies for multi-quadrotor navigation by modifying intermediate activations at inference time without changing model weights, achieving 90% fewer collisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Well-trained RL policies remain vulnerable to infrequent but critical safety failures in obstacle-rich environments, and addressing these through retraining is costly and risks degrading learned skills.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) online classifier monitors intermediate activations to detect states associated with undesired behaviors, (2) activation editing module selectively modifies flagged activations using a latent collision world model that predicts future pre-collision activations.

Result: Extensive simulations and real-world experiments show statistically significant reduction in collisions (nearly 90% fewer cumulative collisions) and substantially increased fraction of collision-free trajectories while preserving task completion.

Conclusion: LAE establishes a lightweight paradigm for post-deployment refinement of learned robot policies that is feasible on resource-constrained hardware.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has enabled significant progress in complex domains
such as coordinating and navigating multiple quadrotors. However, even
well-trained policies remain vulnerable to collisions in obstacle-rich
environments. Addressing these infrequent but critical safety failures through
retraining or fine-tuning is costly and risks degrading previously learned
skills. Inspired by activation steering in large language models and latent
editing in computer vision, we introduce a framework for inference-time Latent
Activation Editing (LAE) that refines the behavior of pre-trained policies
without modifying their weights or architecture. The framework operates in two
stages: (i) an online classifier monitors intermediate activations to detect
states associated with undesired behaviors, and (ii) an activation editing
module that selectively modifies flagged activations to shift the policy
towards safer regimes. In this work, we focus on improving safety in
multi-quadrotor navigation. We hypothesize that amplifying a policy's internal
perception of risk can induce safer behaviors. We instantiate this idea through
a latent collision world model trained to predict future pre-collision
activations, thereby prompting earlier and more cautious avoidance responses.
Extensive simulations and real-world Crazyflie experiments demonstrate that LAE
achieves statistically significant reduction in collisions (nearly 90% fewer
cumulative collisions compared to the unedited baseline) and substantially
increases the fraction of collision-free trajectories, while preserving task
completion. More broadly, our results establish LAE as a lightweight paradigm,
feasible on resource-constrained hardware, for post-deployment refinement of
learned robot policies.

### [97] [Suction Leap-Hand: Suction Cups on a Multi-fingered Hand Enable Embodied Dexterity and In-Hand Teleoperation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20646)
*Sun Zhaole,Xiaofeng Mao,Jihong Zhu,Yuanlong Zhang,Robert B. Fisher*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a paradigm shift from anthropomorphic robotic hand design to novel embodiments, introducing the SLeap Hand with fingertip suction cups that enable stable single-point adhesion instead of complex force-closure grasps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional anthropomorphic approaches to robotic hand design limit capabilities to human tasks and make data collection difficult due to unstable force-closure grasps that complicate teleoperation and amplify sim-to-real gaps.

Method: The authors introduce the SLeap Hand, a multi-fingered hand with integrated fingertip suction cups that replace complex force-closure grasps with stable single-point adhesion, enabling easier teleoperation and data collection.

Result: The suction-based embodiment enables new dexterous skills impossible for human hands (like one-handed paper cutting and in-hand writing) and facilitates stable single-handed completion of tasks that typically require two human hands.

Conclusion: Moving beyond anthropomorphic constraints through novel robotic embodiments can lower barriers for robust manipulation data collection while enabling capabilities beyond human limitations.

Abstract: Dexterous in-hand manipulation remains a foundational challenge in robotics,
with progress often constrained by the prevailing paradigm of imitating the
human hand. This anthropomorphic approach creates two critical barriers: 1) it
limits robotic capabilities to tasks humans can already perform, and 2) it
makes data collection for learning-based methods exceedingly difficult. Both
challenges are caused by traditional force-closure which requires coordinating
complex, multi-point contacts based on friction, normal force, and gravity to
grasp an object. This makes teleoperated demonstrations unstable and amplifies
the sim-to-real gap for reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose a
paradigm shift: moving away from replicating human mechanics toward the design
of novel robotic embodiments. We introduce the \textbf{S}uction
\textbf{Leap}-Hand (SLeap Hand), a multi-fingered hand featuring integrated
fingertip suction cups that realize a new form of suction-enabled dexterity. By
replacing complex force-closure grasps with stable, single-point adhesion, our
design fundamentally simplifies in-hand teleoperation and facilitates the
collection of high-quality demonstration data. More importantly, this
suction-based embodiment unlocks a new class of dexterous skills that are
difficult or even impossible for the human hand, such as one-handed paper
cutting and in-hand writing. Our work demonstrates that by moving beyond
anthropomorphic constraints, novel embodiments can not only lower the barrier
for collecting robust manipulation data but also enable the stable,
single-handed completion of tasks that would typically require two human hands.

### [98] [Cyber Racing Coach: A Haptic Shared Control Framework for Teaching Advanced Driving Skills](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20653)
*Congkai Shen,Siyuan Yu,Yifan Weng,Haoran Ma,Chen Li,Hiroshi Yasuda,James Dallas,Michael Thompson,John Subosits,Tulga Ersal*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A haptic shared control framework called cyber racing coach helps human drivers learn high-performance driving skills by gradually reducing autonomous steering assistance based on driver performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in evaluating haptic shared control's impact on skill acquisition for complex tasks like high-performance driving, as previous research focused on simple tasks or used other feedback methods.

Method: Created a cyber racing coach framework with: (1) an autonomous driving system capable of human cooperation in high-performance scenarios, and (2) a haptic shared control mechanism with fading assistance based on driver performance during training.

Result: The framework helped human drivers develop superior racing skills compared to self-learning and full assistance benchmarks, resulting in better performance and consistency.

Conclusion: The proposed haptic shared control framework with fading assistance effectively teaches advanced driving skills for high-performance scenarios like racing and emergency obstacle avoidance.

Abstract: This study introduces a haptic shared control framework designed to teach
human drivers advanced driving skills. In this context, shared control refers
to a driving mode where the human driver collaborates with an autonomous
driving system to control the steering of a vehicle simultaneously. Advanced
driving skills are those necessary to safely push the vehicle to its handling
limits in high-performance driving such as racing and emergency obstacle
avoidance. Previous research has demonstrated the performance and safety
benefits of shared control schemes using both subjective and objective
evaluations. However, these schemes have not been assessed for their impact on
skill acquisition on complex and demanding tasks. Prior research on long-term
skill acquisition either applies haptic shared control to simple tasks or
employs other feedback methods like visual and auditory aids. To bridge this
gap, this study creates a cyber racing coach framework based on the haptic
shared control paradigm and evaluates its performance in helping human drivers
acquire high-performance driving skills. The framework introduces (1) an
autonomous driving system that is capable of cooperating with humans in a
highly performant driving scenario; and (2) a haptic shared control mechanism
along with a fading scheme to gradually reduce the steering assistance from
autonomy based on the human driver's performance during training. Two
benchmarks are considered: self-learning (no assistance) and full assistance
during training. Results from a human subject study indicate that the proposed
framework helps human drivers develop superior racing skills compared to the
benchmarks, resulting in better performance and consistency.

TL;DR: Proposes a closed-loop BCI-AR-Robot system integrating motor imagery EEG decoding, AR neurofeedback, and robotic grasping for zero-touch operation, achieving high accuracy and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing BCI-Robot systems face limitations: noisy EEG signals, inflexible target selection, and lack of real-world closed-loop validation, hindering assistive applications.

Method: Integrated 14-channel EEG for individualized MI calibration, smartphone-based AR for multi-target navigation with direction-congruent feedback, and robotic arm with vision-based pose estimation for autonomous grasping.

Result: MI training achieved 93.1% accuracy with 14.8 bit/min ITR; AR neurofeedback improved sustained control (SCI=0.210) and achieved highest ITR (21.3 bit/min); closed-loop grasping achieved 97.2% success rate.

Conclusion: AR feedback stabilizes EEG-based control, enabling robust zero-touch grasping and advancing assistive robotics and human-robot interaction.

Abstract: Reliable brain-computer interface (BCI) control of robots provides an
intuitive and accessible means of human-robot interaction, particularly
valuable for individuals with motor impairments. However, existing BCI-Robot
systems face major limitations: electroencephalography (EEG) signals are noisy
and unstable, target selection is often predefined and inflexible, and most
studies remain restricted to simulation without closed-loop validation. These
issues hinder real-world deployment in assistive scenarios. To address them, we
propose a closed-loop BCI-AR-Robot system that integrates motor imagery
(MI)-based EEG decoding, augmented reality (AR) neurofeedback, and robotic
grasping for zero-touch operation. A 14-channel EEG headset enabled
individualized MI calibration, a smartphone-based AR interface supported
multi-target navigation with direction-congruent feedback to enhance stability,
and the robotic arm combined decision outputs with vision-based pose estimation
for autonomous grasping. Experiments are conducted to validate the framework:
MI training achieved 93.1 percent accuracy with an average information transfer
rate (ITR) of 14.8 bit/min; AR neurofeedback significantly improved sustained
control (SCI = 0.210) and achieved the highest ITR (21.3 bit/min) compared with
static, sham, and no-AR baselines; and closed-loop grasping achieved a 97.2
percent success rate with good efficiency and strong user-reported control.
These results show that AR feedback substantially stabilizes EEG-based control
and that the proposed framework enables robust zero-touch grasping, advancing
assistive robotic applications and future modes of human-robot interaction.

Conclusion: Equi-RO demonstrates superior accuracy and robustness for 4D radar odometry, making it a promising solution for autonomous navigation in challenging weather conditions where traditional sensors fail.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles and robots rely on accurate odometry estimation in
GPS-denied environments. While LiDARs and cameras struggle under extreme
weather, 4D mmWave radar emerges as a robust alternative with all-weather
operability and velocity measurement. In this paper, we introduce Equi-RO, an
equivariant network-based framework for 4D radar odometry. Our algorithm
pre-processes Doppler velocity into invariant node and edge features in the

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FINS is a lightweight framework that reconstructs high-fidelity surfaces and SDF fields from single or few images, achieving fast convergence within seconds and outperforming state-of-the-art methods in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional implicit surface reconstruction methods like NeuS require multiple images and long training times. FINS aims to enable efficient single-image surface reconstruction for robotics applications.

Method: FINS integrates a multi-resolution hash grid encoder with lightweight geometry and color heads, using approximate second-order optimization. It leverages pre-trained foundation models to estimate geometry from single RGB images.

Result: FINS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in convergence speed and accuracy on surface reconstruction and SDF field estimation. It achieves training convergence within seconds and demonstrates applicability for robot surface following tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed FINS framework enables fast and accurate neural surface reconstruction from single images, showing strong performance across various benchmark datasets and practical robotics applications.

Abstract: Implicit representations have been widely applied in robotics for obstacle
avoidance and path planning. In this paper, we explore the problem of
constructing an implicit distance representation from a single image. Past
methods for implicit surface reconstruction, such as \emph{NeuS} and its
variants generally require a large set of multi-view images as input, and
require long training times. In this work, we propose Fast Image-to-Neural
Surface (FINS), a lightweight framework that can reconstruct high-fidelity
surfaces and SDF fields based on a single or a small set of images. FINS
integrates a multi-resolution hash grid encoder with lightweight geometry and
color heads, making the training via an approximate second-order optimizer
highly efficient and capable of converging within a few seconds. Additionally,
we achieve the construction of a neural surface requiring only a single RGB
image, by leveraging pre-trained foundation models to estimate the geometry
inherent in the image. Our experiments demonstrate that under the same
conditions, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both
convergence speed and accuracy on surface reconstruction and SDF field
estimation. Moreover, we demonstrate the applicability of FINS for robot
surface following tasks and show its scalability to a variety of benchmark
datasets.

*Shouren Mao,Minghao Qin,Wei Dong,Huajian Liu,Yongzhuo Gao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RAM-NAS is a resource-aware multi-objective neural architecture search method that improves supernet pretraining and considers actual robot hardware resources through mutual distillation and latency surrogate predictors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional NAS approaches are insufficient for training supernets and ignore actual robot hardware resource constraints, creating a need for methods that can balance model accuracy with hardware-specific latency requirements.

Method: Proposes subnets mutual distillation using sandwich rule sampling and DKD loss for logits distillation. Uses latency surrogate predictors trained on three robotic edge hardware types to estimate inference latency during evolutionary search.

Result: RAM-NAS models achieve 76.7% to 81.4% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, significantly reduce inference latency on robot edge hardware, and outperform MobileNetv3-based methods in detection and segmentation tasks across all three hardware types.

Conclusion: The work successfully addresses the gap in NAS for robot hardware resource-awareness by providing a unified multi-objective approach that balances accuracy and latency trade-offs for robotic applications.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) has shown great promise in automatically
designing lightweight models. However, conventional approaches are insufficient
in training the supernet and pay little attention to actual robot hardware
resources. To meet such challenges, we propose RAM-NAS, a resource-aware
multi-objective NAS method that focuses on improving the supernet pretrain and
resource-awareness on robot hardware devices. We introduce the concept of
subnets mutual distillation, which refers to mutually distilling all subnets
sampled by the sandwich rule. Additionally, we utilize the Decoupled Knowledge
Distillation (DKD) loss to enhance logits distillation performance. To expedite
the search process with consideration for hardware resources, we used data from
three types of robotic edge hardware to train Latency Surrogate predictors.
These predictors facilitated the estimation of hardware inference latency
during the search phase, enabling a unified multi-objective evolutionary search
to balance model accuracy and latency trade-offs. Our discovered model family,
RAM-NAS models, can achieve top-1 accuracy ranging from 76.7% to 81.4% on
ImageNet. In addition, the resource-aware multi-objective NAS we employ
significantly reduces the model's inference latency on edge hardware for
robots. We conducted experiments on downstream tasks to verify the scalability
of our methods. The inference time for detection and segmentation is reduced on
all three hardware types compared to MobileNetv3-based methods. Our work fills
the gap in NAS for robot hardware resource-aware.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper extends a forced-oscillation-based reduced-order walking model to include ankles and feet, showing improved gait characteristics and novel stabilization properties through ankle strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more realistic walking model that incorporates ankle and foot dynamics, aiming to better understand anthropomorphic walking and stabilization mechanisms observed in humans.

Method: The authors extended a forced-oscillation-based reduced-order model of walking to include ankles and feet, designing a human-inspired paradigm for ankle dynamics. They analyzed stabilization through both foot placement and ankle strategies.

Result: The proposed model demonstrated improved gait characteristics compared to point-foot models. It can stabilize against large initial condition errors using combined foot placement and ankle strategies, and against small perturbations using only proprioceptive ankle control without foot placement.

Conclusion: The model successfully captures human-like stabilization mechanisms, particularly the ability to handle small perturbations through ankle strategies alone, providing insights into anthropomorphic walking dynamics and control.

Abstract: This paper extends the forced-oscillation-based reduced-order model of
walking to a model with ankles and feet. A human-inspired paradigm was designed
for the ankle dynamics, which results in improved gait characteristics compared
to the point-foot model. In addition, it was shown that while the proposed
model can stabilize against large errors in initial conditions through
combination of foot placement and ankle strategies, the model is able to
stabilize against small perturbations without relying on the foot placement
control and solely through the designed proprioceptive ankle scheme. This novel
property, which is also observed in humans, can help in better understanding of
anthropomorphic walking and its stabilization mechanisms.

*Qingpeng Li,Chengrui Zhu,Yanming Wu,Xin Yuan,Zhen Zhang,Jian Yang,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RuN is a decoupled residual learning framework that enables humanoid robots to achieve natural locomotion and smooth walk-run transitions by separating motion generation from dynamical correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods force a single policy to handle motion imitation, velocity tracking, and stability simultaneously, which is challenging for achieving natural locomotion across different speeds.

Method: Pairs a pre-trained Conditional Motion Generator (providing kinematically natural motion prior) with an RL policy that learns lightweight residual corrections for dynamical interactions.

Result: Achieves stable, natural gaits and smooth walk-run transitions across 0-2.5 m/s velocity range, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in training efficiency and performance on Unitree G1 robot.

Conclusion: The decoupled approach of RuN successfully addresses the challenge of natural humanoid locomotion by separating kinematic motion generation from dynamic stability correction.

Abstract: Enabling humanoid robots to achieve natural and dynamic locomotion across a
wide range of speeds, including smooth transitions from walking to running,
presents a significant challenge. Existing deep reinforcement learning methods
typically require the policy to directly track a reference motion, forcing a
single policy to simultaneously learn motion imitation, velocity tracking, and
stability maintenance. To address this, we introduce RuN, a novel decoupled
residual learning framework. RuN decomposes the control task by pairing a
pre-trained Conditional Motion Generator, which provides a kinematically
natural motion prior, with a reinforcement learning policy that learns a
lightweight residual correction to handle dynamical interactions. Experiments
in simulation and reality on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot demonstrate that RuN
achieves stable, natural gaits and smooth walk-run transitions across a broad
velocity range (0-2.5 m/s), outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both
training efficiency and final performance.

TL;DR: JFTO framework enables robots to learn manipulation tasks from human video demonstrations by treating them as object-centric guides rather than directly imitating human hand motions, balancing grasp feasibility, trajectory consistency, and collision avoidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning from human video demonstrations offers scalable robot teaching but faces challenges due to embodiment differences and joint feasibility constraints between humans and robots.

Method: Joint Flow Trajectory Optimization (JFTO) framework that extends flow matching to SE(3) for probabilistic object trajectory modeling, integrating grasp similarity, trajectory likelihood, and collision penalties into a unified differentiable objective.

Result: Validated in both simulation and real-world experiments across diverse manipulation tasks, showing effective imitation while avoiding mode collapse.

Conclusion: The proposed JFTO framework successfully addresses the challenges of video-based Learning-from-Demonstration by providing a probabilistic, object-centric approach that ensures kinematic feasibility and collision-free execution.

Abstract: Learning from human video demonstrations offers a scalable alternative to
teleoperation or kinesthetic teaching, but poses challenges for robot
manipulators due to embodiment differences and joint feasibility constraints.
We address this problem by proposing the Joint Flow Trajectory Optimization
(JFTO) framework for grasp pose generation and object trajectory imitation
under the video-based Learning-from-Demonstration (LfD) paradigm. Rather than
directly imitating human hand motions, our method treats demonstrations as
object-centric guides, balancing three objectives: (i) selecting a feasible
grasp pose, (ii) generating object trajectories consistent with demonstrated
motions, and (iii) ensuring collision-free execution within robot kinematics.
To capture the multimodal nature of demonstrations, we extend flow matching to
$\SE(3)$ for probabilistic modeling of object trajectories, enabling
density-aware imitation that avoids mode collapse. The resulting optimization
integrates grasp similarity, trajectory likelihood, and collision penalties
into a unified differentiable objective. We validate our approach in both
simulation and real-world experiments across diverse real-world manipulation
tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: BIM2RDT is an AI framework that transforms static BIM models into dynamic, robot-ready digital twins by integrating BIM data, IoT sensor networks, and robot-collected visual data using Semantic-Gravity ICP algorithm for improved alignment and real-time safety monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between pre-existing BIM data and real-time construction site conditions, enabling safer and more efficient digital management through dynamic digital twins that can guide autonomous field operations.

Method: Uses Semantic-Gravity ICP algorithm with LLM reasoning for point cloud registration, integrates YOLOE object detection and Shi-Tomasi corner detection, and incorporates real-time Hand-Arm Vibration monitoring mapped to digital twins using IFC standards.

Result: SG-ICP achieved RMSE reductions of 64.3%-88.3% over standard ICP in alignment accuracy, and the framework successfully triggers safety warnings when vibration exposure limits are exceeded.

Conclusion: The BIM2RDT framework effectively creates dynamic, robot-ready digital twins that improve construction site safety and operational efficiency through advanced AI integration and real-time monitoring capabilities.

Abstract: The adoption of cyber-physical systems and jobsite intelligence that connects
design models, real-time site sensing, and autonomous field operations can
dramatically enhance digital management in the construction industry. This
paper introduces BIM2RDT (Building Information Models to Robot-Ready Site
Digital Twins), an agentic artificial intelligence (AI) framework designed to
transform static Building Information Modeling (BIM) into dynamic, robot-ready
digital twins (DTs) that prioritize safety during execution. The framework
bridges the gap between pre-existing BIM data and real-time site conditions by
integrating three key data streams: geometric and semantic information from BIM
models, activity data from IoT sensor networks, and visual-spatial data
collected by robots during site traversal. The methodology introduces
Semantic-Gravity ICP (SG-ICP), a point cloud registration algorithm that
leverages large language model (LLM) reasoning. Unlike traditional methods,
SG-ICP utilizes an LLM to infer object-specific, plausible orientation priors
based on BIM semantics, improving alignment accuracy by avoiding convergence on
local minima. This creates a feedback loop where robot-collected data updates
the DT, which in turn optimizes paths for missions. The framework employs YOLOE
object detection and Shi-Tomasi corner detection to identify and track
construction elements while using BIM geometry as a priori maps. The framework
also integrates real-time Hand-Arm Vibration (HAV) monitoring, mapping
sensor-detected safety events to the digital twin using IFC standards for
intervention. Experiments demonstrate SG-ICP's superiority over standard ICP,
achieving RMSE reductions of 64.3%--88.3% in alignment across scenarios with
occluded features, ensuring plausible orientations. HAV integration triggers
warnings upon exceeding exposure limits, enhancing compliance with ISO 5349-1.

TL;DR: A novel framework that integrates natural language prompts with BIM-derived semantic maps using Beta-Bernoulli Bayesian fusion to enable safer, context-aware robotic path planning in construction environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable construction robots to understand and respond to natural language directives from workers while leveraging rich environmental information from Building Information Models (BIM) for safer and more context-aware mission planning.

Method: Treats LLM as a sensor, modeling obstacle repulsive coefficients as Beta random variables and updating them with LLM-returned danger scores as pseudo-counts. Uses posterior mean as context-aware repulsive gain to augment Euclidean-distance-based potential fields for cost heuristics.

Result: Simulation results show both qualitative and quantitative improvements in path robustness and validity compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The Beta-Bernoulli fusion provides a numerically stable method that can chain multiple natural commands, enabling flexible integration into various AI frameworks while improving robotic path planning safety and context-awareness.

Abstract: Integrating natural language (NL) prompts into robotic mission planning has
attracted significant interest in recent years. In the construction domain,
Building Information Models (BIM) encapsulate rich NL descriptions of the
environment. We present a novel framework that fuses NL directives with
BIM-derived semantic maps via a Beta-Bernoulli Bayesian fusion by interpreting
the LLM as a sensor: each obstacle's design-time repulsive coefficient is
treated as a Beta(alpha, beta) random variable and LLM-returned danger scores
are incorporated as pseudo-counts to update alpha and beta. The resulting
posterior mean yields a continuous, context-aware repulsive gain that augments
a Euclidean-distance-based potential field for cost heuristics. By adjusting
gains based on sentiment and context inferred from user prompts, our method
guides robots along safer, more context-aware paths. This provides a
numerically stable method that can chain multiple natural commands and prompts
from construction workers and foreman to enable planning while giving
flexibility to be integrated in any learned or classical AI framework.
Simulation results demonstrate that this Beta-Bernoulli fusion yields both
qualitative and quantitative improvements in path robustness and validity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon, high-dynamic motion tracking on humanoids remains brittle because absolute joint commands cannot compensate model-plant mismatch, leading to error accumulation.

Method: Uses a single-stage reinforcement learning setup with unified observation, reward, and hyperparameter configuration. The framework predicts residual joint targets to explicitly correct dynamics discrepancies in an end-to-end pipeline (training, sim-to-sim validation, and zero-shot sim-to-real).

Result: RobotDancing can track multi-minute, high-energy behaviors (jumps, spins, cartwheels) and deploys zero-shot to hardware with high motion tracking quality, validated on Unitree G1 with retargeted LAFAN1 dance sequences and transfer on H1/H1-2.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the brittleness of long-horizon motion tracking by predicting residual corrections, enabling robust zero-shot deployment of complex dynamic behaviors on humanoid robots.

Abstract: Long-horizon, high-dynamic motion tracking on humanoids remains brittle
because absolute joint commands cannot compensate model-plant mismatch, leading
to error accumulation. We propose RobotDancing, a simple, scalable framework
that predicts residual joint targets to explicitly correct dynamics

zero-shot sim-to-real--and uses a single-stage reinforcement learning (RL)
setup with a unified observation, reward, and hyperparameter configuration. We
evaluate primarily on Unitree G1 with retargeted LAFAN1 dance sequences and
validate transfer on H1/H1-2. RobotDancing can track multi-minute, high-energy

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional SLAM pipelines for legged robots are fragile under rapid motion, calibration demands, and sensor drift, while offering limited semantic reasoning for task-driven exploration.

Method: Hierarchical vision-language perception module fuses scene-level context with object-level cues. Semantic-probabilistic topological map supports LLM-based global reasoning for subgoal selection and vision-based local planning for obstacle avoidance, integrated with reinforcement-learning locomotion controllers.

Result: Experiments in simulation and real-world settings demonstrate consistent improvements in semantic accuracy, planning quality, and navigation success. Ablation studies showcase the necessity of both hierarchical perception and fine local planning.

Conclusion: This work introduces a new paradigm for SLAM-free, vision-language-driven navigation, shifting robotic exploration from geometry-centric mapping to semantics-driven decision making.

Abstract: Conventional SLAM pipelines for legged robot navigation are fragile under
rapid motion, calibration demands, and sensor drift, while offering limited
semantic reasoning for task-driven exploration. To deal with these issues, we
propose a vision-only, SLAM-free navigation framework that replaces dense
geometry with semantic reasoning and lightweight topological representations. A
hierarchical vision-language perception module fuses scene-level context with
object-level cues for robust semantic inference. And a semantic-probabilistic
topological map supports coarse-to-fine planning: LLM-based global reasoning
for subgoal selection and vision-based local planning for obstacle avoidance.
Integrated with reinforcement-learning locomotion controllers, the framework is
deployable across diverse legged robot platforms. Experiments in simulation and
real-world settings demonstrate consistent improvements in semantic accuracy,
planning quality, and navigation success, while ablation studies further
showcase the necessity of both hierarchical perception and fine local planning.
This work introduces a new paradigm for SLAM-free, vision-language-driven
navigation, shifting robotic exploration from geometry-centric mapping to
semantics-driven decision making.

*Yuxuan Zhou,Xingxing Li,Shengyu Li,Zhuohao Yan,Chunxi Xia,Shaoquan Feng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MASt3R-Fusion is a multi-sensor visual SLAM framework that integrates feed-forward neural pointmap regression with inertial and GNSS data using a hierarchical factor graph for real-time pose tracking and globally consistent mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical visual SLAM systems struggle with low-texture environments and challenging visual conditions, while recent neural pointmap regression methods discard the advantages of probabilistic multi-sensor fusion.

Method: The system introduces Sim(3)-based visual alignment constraints into a universal metric-scale SE(3) factor graph, with hierarchical design for real-time sliding-window optimization and global optimization with aggressive loop closures.

Result: Evaluation on public benchmarks and self-collected datasets shows substantial improvements in accuracy and robustness over existing visual-centered multi-sensor SLAM systems.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates neural pointmap regression with multi-sensor fusion, achieving real-time performance and global consistency, with code released open-source for reproducibility.

Abstract: Visual SLAM is a cornerstone technique in robotics, autonomous driving and
extended reality (XR), yet classical systems often struggle with low-texture
environments, scale ambiguity, and degraded performance under challenging
visual conditions. Recent advancements in feed-forward neural network-based
pointmap regression have demonstrated the potential to recover high-fidelity 3D
scene geometry directly from images, leveraging learned spatial priors to
overcome limitations of traditional multi-view geometry methods. However, the
widely validated advantages of probabilistic multi-sensor information fusion
are often discarded in these pipelines. In this work, we propose
MASt3R-Fusion,a multi-sensor-assisted visual SLAM framework that tightly
integrates feed-forward pointmap regression with complementary sensor
information, including inertial measurements and GNSS data. The system
introduces Sim(3)-based visualalignment constraints (in the Hessian form) into
a universal metric-scale SE(3) factor graph for effective information fusion. A
hierarchical factor graph design is developed, which allows both real-time
sliding-window optimization and global optimization with aggressive loop
closures, enabling real-time pose tracking, metric-scale structure perception
and globally consistent mapping. We evaluate our approach on both public
benchmarks and self-collected datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements
in accuracy and robustness over existing visual-centered multi-sensor SLAM
systems. The code will be released open-source to support reproducibility and
further research (https://github.com/GREAT-WHU/MASt3R-Fusion).

Conclusion: The combination of behavior sharing and adaptive exploration strategies can significantly improve the practicality of MTRL in robotics applications, enabling more efficient state-space coverage in complex environments.

Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) offers a promising approach to
improve sample efficiency and generalization by training agents across multiple

TL;DR: SemSight is a probabilistic bird's-eye-view prediction model that infers room-level semantic structures for unexplored areas in indoor navigation, improving prediction accuracy and navigation efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on single objects or geometric occupancy maps but lack ability to model room-level semantic structures, which is crucial for efficient navigation and environment understanding.

Method: Uses an encoder-decoder network with mask-constrained supervision strategy that applies binary masks to unexplored areas, forcing the model to infer semantic structures from observed context. Trained on 2,000 indoor layout graphs with 40,000 sequential egocentric observations.

Result: Improves prediction performance for key functional categories in unexplored regions, outperforms non-mask-supervised approaches on Structural Consistency (SC) and Region Recognition Accuracy (PA) metrics, and enhances navigation efficiency by reducing search steps.

Conclusion: SemSight effectively models room-level semantic structures and demonstrates superior performance in predicting unexplored areas, making it valuable for target-driven navigation and autonomous exploration tasks.

Abstract: In target-driven navigation and autonomous exploration, reasonable prediction
of unknown regions is crucial for efficient navigation and environment
understanding. Existing methods mostly focus on single objects or geometric
occupancy maps, lacking the ability to model room-level semantic structures. We
propose SemSight, a probabilistic bird's-eye-view prediction model for
multi-level scene semantics. The model jointly infers structural layouts,
global scene context, and target area distributions, completing semantic maps
of unexplored areas while estimating probability maps for target categories. To
train SemSight, we simulate frontier-driven exploration on 2,000 indoor layout
graphs, constructing a diverse dataset of 40,000 sequential egocentric
observations paired with complete semantic maps. We adopt an encoder-decoder
network as the core architecture and introduce a mask-constrained supervision
strategy. This strategy applies a binary mask of unexplored areas so that
supervision focuses only on unknown regions, forcing the model to infer
semantic structures from the observed context. Experimental results show that
SemSight improves prediction performance for key functional categories in
unexplored regions and outperforms non-mask-supervised approaches on metrics
such as Structural Consistency (SC) and Region Recognition Accuracy (PA). It
also enhances navigation efficiency in closed-loop simulations, reducing the
number of search steps when guiding robots toward target areas.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing end-to-end neural networks for robotic manipulation, including VLM/VLA-based models, are insufficiently performant for large-scale practical deployment despite advantages over traditional modular pipelines.

Method: Develops CoMOK formulation as action representation for neural policies, extending standard end-effector pose representation to support diverse manipulation tasks with oriented keypoints that generalize to objects of different shapes and sizes.

Result: Achieves sub-centimeter accuracy, handles multi-stage tasks, multi-modal robot behaviors, and deformable objects. Extensive simulated and hardware experiments demonstrate effectiveness.

Conclusion: CoMOK represents a significant step towards generalizable, accurate, and reliable end-to-end manipulation policies suitable for practical deployment.

Abstract: End-to-end robot manipulation policies offer significant potential for
enabling embodied agents to understand and interact with the world. Unlike
traditional modular pipelines, end-to-end learning mitigates key limitations
such as information loss between modules and feature misalignment caused by
isolated optimization targets. Despite these advantages, existing end-to-end
neural networks for robotic manipulation--including those based on large
VLM/VLA models--remain insufficiently performant for large-scale practical
deployment. In this paper, we take a step towards an end-to-end manipulation
policy that is generalizable, accurate and reliable. To achieve this goal, we
propose a novel Chain of Moving Oriented Keypoints (CoMOK) formulation for
robotic manipulation. Our formulation is used as the action representation of a
neural policy, which can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. Such an action
representation is general, as it extends the standard end-effector pose action
representation and supports a diverse set of manipulation tasks in a unified
manner. The oriented keypoint in our method enables natural generalization to
objects with different shapes and sizes, while achieving sub-centimeter
accuracy. Moreover, our formulation can easily handle multi-stage tasks,
multi-modal robot behaviors, and deformable objects. Extensive simulated and
hardware experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Conclusion: MTRDrive demonstrates strong potential to advance autonomous driving toward safer and more reliable systems by robustly handling unseen scenarios through its memory-tool synergistic reasoning approach.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models(VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential for
end-to-end autonomous driving, yet a substantial gap remains between their
current capabilities and the reliability necessary for real-world deployment. A
critical challenge is their fragility, characterized by hallucinations and poor
generalization in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MTRDrive, a novel framework that integrates procedural driving
experiences with a dynamic toolkit to enhance generalization and proactive
decision-making.
  MTRDrive addresses these limitations through a closed-loop system that
combines a memory-based experience retrieval mechanism with dynamic toolkits.
This synergy enables the model to interact more effectively with its
environment, improving both reasoning and decision-making capabilities with the
help of our memory-tool synergistic reasoning. Additionally, we introduce a new
benchmark based on complex Roadwork construction scenarios to rigorously
evaluate zero-shot generalization.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our approach.
On the public NAVSIM benchmark, our 3B-parameter MTRDrive model achieves an
exceptional PDMS of 88.3 without chain-of-thought and sets a state-of-the-art
performance bar on high-level planning, with a driving metric score of 79.8\%
and a planning accuracy of 82.6\%. Rigorous zero-shot evaluation on the new
Roadwork-VLM benchmark shows a strong ability to reason robustly in unseen

TL;DR: This paper addresses erratic gradient behavior in differentiable physics simulators caused by contact models, proposing a new contact model that ensures well-behaved gradients for improved optimization in control and robotic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Differentiable physics is crucial for applications like model predictive control and robotic design, but current simulators suffer from abrupt or vanishing gradients due to problematic contact models, hindering gradient-based optimization convergence.

Method: The authors identify key properties that contact models must satisfy for stable gradients, then design a practical contact model for differentiable rigid-body simulators that meets these properties while maintaining computational efficiency.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the proposed contact model enables discovery of complex, contact-rich control signals from simple initializations, successfully executing various locomotion and manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: The work establishes a principled foundation for contact modeling in differentiable simulators, showing that proper contact model design is essential for reliable gradient information and effective optimization in physics-based applications.

Abstract: With the maturation of differentiable physics, its role in various downstream
applications: such as model predictive control, robotic design optimization,
and neural PDE solvers, has become increasingly important. However, the
derivative information provided by differentiable simulators can exhibit abrupt
changes or vanish altogether, impeding the convergence of gradient-based
optimizers. In this work, we demonstrate that such erratic gradient behavior is
closely tied to the design of contact models. We further introduce a set of
properties that a contact model must satisfy to ensure well-behaved gradient
information. Lastly, we present a practical contact model for differentiable
rigid-body simulators that satisfies all of these properties while maintaining
computational efficiency. Our experiments show that, even from simple
initializations, our contact model can discover complex, contact-rich control
signals, enabling the successful execution of a range of downstream locomotion
and manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes TISA (Time-Invariant Spatial Alignment) module to address spatio-temporal misalignment in autoregressive planning for autonomous driving, achieving state-of-the-art performance on NAVSIM dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models for autonomous driving planning suffer from spatio-temporal misalignment where future actions must condition on past sensory data, creating an inconsistent worldview that limits performance.

Method: Proposes TISA module to project environmental features into consistent ego-centric frames for each future time step, uses kinematic action prediction head for physically feasible trajectories, and employs multi-objective DPO post-training for fine-grained behavior optimization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art 89.8 PDMS on NAVSIM dataset among autoregressive models, demonstrating improved planning performance.

Conclusion: The TISA module effectively corrects worldview inconsistencies in autoregressive planning, and the multi-objective DPO approach provides superior fine-grained learning compared to standard imitation learning methods.

Abstract: The inherent sequential modeling capabilities of autoregressive models make
them a formidable baseline for end-to-end planning in autonomous driving.
Nevertheless, their performance is constrained by a spatio-temporal
misalignment, as the planner must condition future actions on past sensory
data. This creates an inconsistent worldview, limiting the upper bound of
performance for an otherwise powerful approach. To address this, we propose a
Time-Invariant Spatial Alignment (TISA) module that learns to project initial
environmental features into a consistent ego-centric frame for each future time
step, effectively correcting the agent's worldview without explicit future
scene prediction. In addition, we employ a kinematic action prediction head
(i.e., acceleration and yaw rate) to ensure physically feasible trajectories.
Finally, we introduce a multi-objective post-training stage using Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) to move beyond pure imitation. Our approach
provides targeted feedback on specific driving behaviors, offering a more
fine-grained learning signal than the single, overall objective used in
standard DPO. Our model achieves a state-of-the-art 89.8 PDMS on the NAVSIM
dataset among autoregressive models. The video document is available at

<details>

Motivation: EV battery disassembly requires precise multi-robot coordination, reliable motions, and robust collision safety in cluttered, dynamic environments, which existing methods struggle to provide.

Method: Four-layer TAMP framework coupling symbolic task planning with cost/accessibility-aware allocation and TP-GMM-guided motion planning learned from demonstrations, using stereo vision with YOLOv8 for real-time localization and OctoMap/FCL for collision checking.

Result: Substantial improvements over RRTConnect baseline: 63.3% reduction in end-effector path length, 8.1% reduction in makespan, significant swept volume reductions (R1: 0.583→0.139 m³; R2: 0.696→0.252 m³), and 47% decrease in mutual overlap (0.064→0.034 m³).

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates improved autonomy, precision, and safety for multi-robot EV battery disassembly in unstructured, dynamic environments, highlighting its practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Electric-vehicle (EV) battery disassembly requires precise multi-robot
coordination, short and reliable motions, and robust collision safety in
cluttered, dynamic scenes. We propose a four-layer task-and-motion planning
(TAMP) framework that couples symbolic task planning and cost- and
accessibility-aware allocation with a TP-GMM-guided motion planner learned from
demonstrations. Stereo vision with YOLOv8 provides real-time component
localization, while OctoMap-based 3D mapping and FCL(Flexible Collision

reactive, vision-based avoidance. Validated on two UR10e robots across cable,
busbar, service plug, and three leaf-cell removals, the approach yields
substantially more compact and safer motions than a default RRTConnect baseline
under identical perception and task assignments: average end-effector path

TL;DR: KeyWorld is a framework that accelerates robotic world models by focusing transformer computation on semantic key frames and using lightweight interpolation for intermediate frames, achieving 5.68× speedup while improving physical plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotic world models suffer from slow inference speed due to redundant frame-to-frame computation and lack physical plausibility by neglecting important semantic transitions in motion trajectories.

Method: KeyWorld identifies significant motion transitions to obtain key frames, trains a DiT model to generate these key frames from text descriptions, and uses a lightweight interpolator to fill intermediate frames efficiently.

Result: Evaluation on LIBERO benchmark shows 5.68× acceleration compared to frame-to-frame baseline, with improved physical validity especially on complex tasks.

Conclusion: KeyWorld provides a practical path toward deploying efficient and effective world models in real-time robotic control and other applications requiring both speed and physical accuracy.

Abstract: Robotic world models are a promising paradigm for forecasting future
environment states, yet their inference speed and the physical plausibility of
generated trajectories remain critical bottlenecks, limiting their real-world
applications. This stems from the redundancy of the prevailing frame-to-frame
generation approach, where the model conducts costly computation on similar
frames, as well as neglecting the semantic importance of key transitions. To
address this inefficiency, we propose KeyWorld, a framework that improves
text-conditioned robotic world models by concentrating transformers computation
on a few semantic key frames while employing a lightweight convolutional model
to fill the intermediate frames. Specifically, KeyWorld first identifies
significant transitions by iteratively simplifying the robot's motion
trajectories, obtaining the ground truth key frames. Then, a DiT model is
trained to reason and generate these physically meaningful key frames from
textual task descriptions. Finally, a lightweight interpolator efficiently
reconstructs the full video by inpainting all intermediate frames. Evaluations
on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that KeyWorld achieves a 5.68$\times$
acceleration compared to the frame-to-frame generation baseline, and focusing
on the motion-aware key frames further contributes to the physical validity of
the generated videos, especially on complex tasks. Our approach highlights a
practical path toward deploying world models in real-time robotic control and
other domains requiring both efficient and effective world models. Code is

Abstract: This paper presents an integrated Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Model

Motivation: Current probabilistic models like diffusion models have high computational costs for inference and cannot quantify output uncertainty, which is critical for trustworthy general-purpose robotics.

Method: The paper proposes Normalizing Flows Policy, a visuomotor policy learning model based on Normalizing Flows, which offers natural confidence measures and efficient inference compared to diffusion models.

Conclusion: Normalizing Flows are a powerful alternative to diffusion models for robotic policy learning, providing both performance benefits and crucial uncertainty quantification for trustworthy robotics.

Abstract: The field of general purpose robotics has recently embraced powerful
probabilistic models, such as diffusion models, to model and learn complex
behaviors. However, these models often come with significant trade-offs, namely
high computational costs for inference and a fundamental inability to quantify
output uncertainty. We argue that a model's trustworthiness, a critical factor
for reliable, general-purpose robotics, is inherently linked to its ability to
provide confidence measures.
  In this work, we introduce Normalizing Flows Policy, a novel visuomotor
policy learning model based on Normalizing Flows. We show that Normalizing
Flows are a natural and powerful alternative to diffusion models, providing
both a statistically sound measure of confidence and a highly efficient

simulated robotic tasks, we demonstrate that Normalizing Flows Policy achieves
performance comparable to, and often surpassing, Diffusion Policy, and it does
so not only with improved sample efficiency but also with up to 30 times faster
inference. Additionally, our ablation study validates several key architectural
and training techniques that enable Normalizing Flows to perform well in this

Method: The system analyzes basic attitude sensor readings and flight commands to detect ground effect changes, which indicate boundaries between different materials. This leverages ground effect as a new sensing modality without compromising flight stability.

Result: Achieves high detection accuracy with mean detection distance errors of 0.051m, outperforming baseline methods by 86%. The system requires only 43 mW power consumption.

Conclusion: AirTouch demonstrates that ground effect can be effectively repurposed for accurate and efficient edge detection, offering a low-cost, resource-efficient alternative to vision-based methods for drone applications.

Abstract: Drone-based rapid and accurate environmental edge detection is highly
advantageous for tasks such as disaster relief and autonomous navigation.
Current methods, using radars or cameras, raise deployment costs and burden
lightweight drones with high computational demands. In this paper, we propose
AirTouch, a system that transforms the ground effect from a stability "foe" in
traditional flight control views, into a "friend" for accurate and efficient
edge detection. Our key insight is that analyzing drone basic attitude sensor
readings and flight commands allows us to detect ground effect changes. Such
changes typically indicate the drone flying over a boundary of two materials,
making this information valuable for edge detection. We approach this insight
through theoretical analysis, algorithm design, and implementation, fully
leveraging the ground effect as a new sensing modality without compromising
drone flight stability, thereby achieving accurate and efficient scene edge
detection. We also compare this new sensing modality with vision-based methods
to clarify its exclusive advantages in resource efficiency and detection
capability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our system achieves a high
detection accuracy with mean detection distance errors of 0.051m, outperforming
the baseline method performance by 86%. With such detection performance, our
system requires only 43 mW power consumption, contributing to this new sensing
modality for low-cost and highly efficient edge detection.

### [124] [Cross-Modal Instructions for Robot Motion Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21107)
*William Barron,Xiaoxiang Dong,Matthew Johnson-Roberson,Weiming Zhi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CrossInstruct: A framework that uses cross-modal instructions (text labels and rough annotations) instead of physical demonstrations to teach robots novel behaviors, leveraging vision-language models to generate 3D motion trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional robot teaching requires cumbersome motion demonstrations via teleoperation or physical guidance, which doesn't scale well. There's a need for more scalable and accessible methods to specify desired robot behaviors.

Method: Integrates cross-modal instructions into a foundational VLM context, which iteratively queries a fine-tuned model to synthesize motion over multiple 2D views, then fuses them into 3D motion trajectories. Combines large VLM reasoning with fine-grained pointing models.

Result: Produces executable robot behaviors that generalize beyond the limited instruction examples, and provides strong initialization for reinforcement learning policies that can be efficiently refined.

Conclusion: CrossInstruct enables effective robot behavior learning without additional fine-tuning, demonstrating scalability and generalization capabilities on both simulation and real hardware tasks.

Abstract: Teaching robots novel behaviors typically requires motion demonstrations via
teleoperation or kinaesthetic teaching, that is, physically guiding the robot.
While recent work has explored using human sketches to specify desired
behaviors, data collection remains cumbersome, and demonstration datasets are
difficult to scale. In this paper, we introduce an alternative paradigm,
Learning from Cross-Modal Instructions, where robots are shaped by
demonstrations in the form of rough annotations, which can contain free-form
text labels, and are used in lieu of physical motion. We introduce the
CrossInstruct framework, which integrates cross-modal instructions as examples
into the context input to a foundational vision-language model (VLM). The VLM
then iteratively queries a smaller, fine-tuned model, and synthesizes the
desired motion over multiple 2D views. These are then subsequently fused into a
coherent distribution over 3D motion trajectories in the robot's workspace. By
incorporating the reasoning of the large VLM with a fine-grained pointing
model, CrossInstruct produces executable robot behaviors that generalize beyond
the environment of in the limited set of instruction examples. We then
introduce a downstream reinforcement learning pipeline that leverages
CrossInstruct outputs to efficiently learn policies to complete fine-grained
tasks. We rigorously evaluate CrossInstruct on benchmark simulation tasks and
real hardware, demonstrating effectiveness without additional fine-tuning and
providing a strong initialization for policies subsequently refined via
reinforcement learning.

*Mingjiang Liu,Hailong Huang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hierarchical control framework using RL for drone ball-balancing outperforms PID controllers, with RL's advantage coming from better utilization of rich state observations rather than parameter tuning or nonlinear mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an effective control system for stabilizing a ball on a movable beam using drone-cable interaction, addressing the limitations of traditional PID controllers.

Method: Proposed a hierarchical control framework that separates high-level balancing policy (trained with RL) from low-level drone control, with systematic comparative analysis against PID controllers.

Result: RL policy achieved superior performance compared to carefully tuned PID controllers within the same hierarchical structure, with the advantage attributed to RL's ability to effectively utilize richer state observations.

Conclusion: Comprehensive state representation is critical for learning-based systems, and enhanced sensing could significantly improve controller performance in complex robotic tasks.

Abstract: This paper addresses a drone ball-balancing task, in which a drone stabilizes
a ball atop a movable beam through cable-based interaction. We propose a
hierarchical control framework that decouples high-level balancing policy from
low-level drone control, and train a reinforcement learning (RL) policy to
handle the high-level decision-making. Simulation results show that the RL
policy achieves superior performance compared to carefully tuned PID
controllers within the same hierarchical structure. Through systematic
comparative analysis, we demonstrate that RL's advantage stems not from
improved parameter tuning or inherent nonlinear mapping capabilities, but from
its ability to effectively utilize richer state observations. These findings
underscore the critical role of comprehensive state representation in
learning-based systems and suggest that enhanced sensing could be instrumental
in improving controller performance.

TL;DR: Introduces Automotive-ENV, the first benchmark for vehicle GUI interactions, and ASURADA, a geo-aware multimodal agent that improves safety-aware task performance using location-based context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal agents show strong GUI interaction capabilities but haven't been properly explored for automotive systems, which have unique challenges like limited driver attention, strict safety requirements, and complex location-based interactions.

Method: Created Automotive-ENV benchmark with 185 parameterized tasks across explicit control, implicit intent understanding, and safety-aware categories. Developed ASURADA, a geo-aware multimodal agent that integrates GPS context to dynamically adjust actions based on location, environment, and regional driving norms.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that geo-aware information significantly improves success rates on safety-aware tasks, highlighting the importance of location-based context in automotive environments.

Conclusion: The research establishes the importance of location-aware agents for automotive GUIs and will release Automotive-ENV with all tasks and benchmarking tools to advance development of safe, adaptive in-vehicle agents.

Abstract: Multimodal agents have demonstrated strong performance in general GUI
interactions, but their application in automotive systems has been largely
unexplored. In-vehicle GUIs present distinct challenges: drivers' limited
attention, strict safety requirements, and complex location-based interaction
patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce Automotive-ENV, the first
high-fidelity benchmark and interaction environment tailored for vehicle GUIs.
This platform defines 185 parameterized tasks spanning explicit control,
implicit intent understanding, and safety-aware tasks, and provides structured
multimodal observations with precise programmatic checks for reproducible
evaluation. Building on this benchmark, we propose ASURADA, a geo-aware
multimodal agent that integrates GPS-informed context to dynamically adjust
actions based on location, environmental conditions, and regional driving
norms. Experiments show that geo-aware information significantly improves
success on safety-aware tasks, highlighting the importance of location-based
context in automotive environments. We will release Automotive-ENV, complete
with all tasks and benchmarking tools, to further the development of safe and

*Md Faizal Karim,Vignesh Vembar,Keshab Patra,Gaurav Singh,K Madhava Krishna*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DAGDiff is an end-to-end framework that generates stable dual-arm grasps for large objects using diffusion models with classifier guidance, eliminating the need for region priors or heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable dual-arm grasping for large objects remains challenging due to stability, collision, and generalization requirements. Prior methods rely on decomposition and heuristics that limit generalization and provide no stability guarantees.

Method: DAGDiff directly denoises grasp pairs in SE(3) x SE(3) space using diffusion models guided by geometry-, stability-, and collision-aware classifier signals to ensure physically valid and force-closure compliant grasps.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation shows consistent improvements over previous work in force-closure checks, collision analysis, and physics simulations. The framework successfully generates grasps for unseen objects and executes them on real dual-arm setups.

Conclusion: DAGDiff provides a principled approach to dual-arm grasping that effectively handles stability and collision constraints through classifier-guided diffusion, demonstrating strong generalization to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Reliable dual-arm grasping is essential for manipulating large and complex
objects but remains a challenging problem due to stability, collision, and
generalization requirements. Prior methods typically decompose the task into
two independent grasp proposals, relying on region priors or heuristics that
limit generalization and provide no principled guarantee of stability. We
propose DAGDiff, an end-to-end framework that directly denoises to grasp pairs
in the SE(3) x SE(3) space. Our key insight is that stability and collision can
be enforced more effectively by guiding the diffusion process with classifier
signals, rather than relying on explicit region detection or object priors. To
this end, DAGDiff integrates geometry-, stability-, and collision-aware
guidance terms that steer the generative process toward grasps that are
physically valid and force-closure compliant. We comprehensively evaluate
DAGDiff through analytical force-closure checks, collision analysis, and
large-scale physics-based simulations, showing consistent improvements over
previous work on these metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework
generates dual-arm grasps directly on real-world point clouds of previously
unseen objects, which are executed on a heterogeneous dual-arm setup where two
manipulators reliably grasp and lift them.

TL;DR: ReasonNav is a modular robot navigation system that uses vision-language models to enable human-like navigation behaviors like reading signs and asking for directions, improving efficiency in large environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robot navigation systems are inefficient in large environments because they lack human-like navigation behaviors such as reading signs and asking for directions, which humans use to navigate efficiently.

Method: The system integrates vision-language models with compact input/output abstractions based on navigation landmarks, allowing the VLM to focus on language understanding and reasoning rather than low-level navigation details.

Result: Evaluation on real and simulated navigation tasks shows that ReasonNav successfully employs higher-order reasoning to navigate efficiently in large, complex buildings.

Conclusion: ReasonNav demonstrates that integrating human-like navigation behaviors through vision-language models can significantly improve robot navigation efficiency in complex environments.

Abstract: When navigating in a man-made environment they haven't visited before--like
an office building--humans employ behaviors such as reading signs and asking
others for directions. These behaviors help humans reach their destinations
efficiently by reducing the need to search through large areas. Existing robot
navigation systems lack the ability to execute such behaviors and are thus
highly inefficient at navigating within large environments. We present
ReasonNav, a modular navigation system which integrates these human-like
navigation skills by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of a vision-language
model (VLM). We design compact input and output abstractions based on
navigation landmarks, allowing the VLM to focus on language understanding and
reasoning. We evaluate ReasonNav on real and simulated navigation tasks and
show that the agent successfully employs higher-order reasoning to navigate
efficiently in large, complex buildings.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents novel multi-rotor configurations with additional control inputs for propeller axis manipulation, enabling "omniorientational" drones that can independently control attitude and position. The study develops dynamic models, controllers, and control allocation strategies to address under-actuation limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional multi-rotors are under-actuated systems that cannot independently control attitude from position. This limitation hinders their performance and versatility in various applications.

Method: Developed several distinct configurations with additional control inputs for propeller axis manipulation. Created detailed dynamic models validated through Simscape Multibody simulations. Designed two controllers: a sliding mode controller for robustness and a novel PID-based controller with gravity compensation. Implemented custom control allocation strategy to handle input-non-affine systems and optimize power consumption.

Result: The controllers effectively managed harsh disturbances and uncertainties. Simulations compared configurations and controllers, focusing on power consumption analysis. A qualitative comparison evaluated the impact of different uncertainties on the control system.

Conclusion: The study provides a roadmap for designing omniorientational drones based on specific objectives, offering practical insights for configuration selection and controller design. This research supports the SAC-1 project objectives of Sharif AgRoLab.

Abstract: Conventional multi-rotors are under-actuated systems, hindering them from
independently controlling attitude from position. In this study, we present
several distinct configurations that incorporate additional control inputs for
manipulating the angles of the propeller axes. This addresses the mentioned
limitations, making the systems "omniorientational". We comprehensively derived
detailed dynamic models for all introduced configurations and validated by a
methodology using Simscape Multibody simulations. Two controllers are designed:
a sliding mode controller for robust handling of disturbances and a novel
PID-based controller with gravity compensation integrating linear and
non-linear allocators, designed for computational efficiency. A custom control
allocation strategy is implemented to manage the input-non-affine nature of
these systems, seeking to maximize battery life by minimizing the "Power
Consumption Factor" defined in this study. Moreover, the controllers
effectively managed harsh disturbances and uncertainties. Simulations compare
and analyze the proposed configurations and controllers, majorly considering
their power consumption. Furthermore, we conduct a qualitative comparison to
evaluate the impact of different types of uncertainties on the control system,
highlighting areas for potential model or hardware improvements. The analysis
in this study provides a roadmap for future researchers to design
omniorientational drones based on their design objectives, offering practical
insights into configuration selection and controller design. This research
aligns with the project SAC-1, one of the objectives of Sharif AgRoLab.

*Jaehwi Jang,Zhuoheng Wang,Ziyi Zhou,Feiyang Wu,Ye Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel stable end-effector control (SEEC) framework using model-enhanced residual learning that achieves precise and robust arm end-effector stabilization for humanoid robots through model-guided reinforcement learning with a perturbation generator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arm end-effector stabilization is crucial for humanoid loco-manipulation but challenging due to high degrees of freedom and bipedal instability. Existing model-based methods struggle with real-world factors like friction, while learning-based methods overfit to training conditions and fail to adapt to unseen scenarios.

Method: Proposes SEEC framework with model-enhanced residual learning that uses model-guided reinforcement learning with a perturbation generator to learn precise end-effector compensation for lower-body disturbances. The design allows upper-body policy to achieve stabilization and adapt to unseen locomotion controllers without retraining.

Result: Validated in different simulators and transferred to Booster T1 humanoid robot. Experiments show the method consistently outperforms baselines and robustly handles diverse and demanding loco-manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed SEEC framework successfully addresses the limitations of both model-based and learning-based approaches by combining model guidance with residual learning, enabling robust end-effector stabilization that adapts to unseen scenarios without additional training.

Abstract: Arm end-effector stabilization is essential for humanoid loco-manipulation
tasks, yet it remains challenging due to the high degrees of freedom and
inherent dynamic instability of bipedal robot structures. Previous model-based
controllers achieve precise end-effector control but rely on precise dynamics
modeling and estimation, which often struggle to capture real-world factors
(e.g., friction and backlash) and thus degrade in practice. On the other hand,
learning-based methods can better mitigate these factors via exploration and
domain randomization, and have shown potential in real-world use. However, they
often overfit to training conditions, requiring retraining with the entire
body, and still struggle to adapt to unseen scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel stable end-effector control (SEEC) framework
with model-enhanced residual learning that learns to achieve precise and robust
end-effector compensation for lower-body induced disturbances through
model-guided reinforcement learning (RL) with a perturbation generator. This
design allows the upper-body policy to achieve accurate end-effector
stabilization as well as adapt to unseen locomotion controllers with no
additional training. We validate our framework in different simulators and
transfer trained policies to the Booster T1 humanoid robot. Experiments
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and robustly
handles diverse and demanding loco-manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FSGlove is an inertial-based hand motion capture system that tracks up to 48 DoFs and reconstructs personalized hand shapes using DiffHCal calibration, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with joint angle errors under 2.7 degrees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing commercial gloves are limited to 21 DoFs, which is insufficient for complex manipulations and neglects shape variations critical for contact-rich tasks in robotics, VR, and biomechanics.

Method: FSGlove uses IMUs on each finger joint and dorsum for high-resolution motion sensing. DiffHCal integrates with the parametric MANO model through differentiable optimization to resolve joint kinematics, shape parameters, and sensor misalignment in a single calibration.

Result: The system achieves joint angle errors less than 2.7 degrees, outperforms commercial alternatives in shape reconstruction and contact fidelity, and captures subtle motions like fingertip rubbing.

Conclusion: FSGlove advances hand tracking by unifying kinematic and contact fidelity, bridges the gap between human dexterity and robotic imitation, and offers open-source hardware/software compatible with current VR and robotics ecosystems.

Abstract: Accurate hand motion capture (MoCap) is vital for applications in robotics,
virtual reality, and biomechanics, yet existing systems face limitations in
capturing high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) joint kinematics and personalized hand
shape. Commercial gloves offer up to 21 DoFs, which are insufficient for
complex manipulations while neglecting shape variations that are critical for
contact-rich tasks. We present FSGlove, an inertial-based system that
simultaneously tracks up to 48 DoFs and reconstructs personalized hand shapes
via DiffHCal, a novel calibration method. Each finger joint and the dorsum are
equipped with IMUs, enabling high-resolution motion sensing. DiffHCal
integrates with the parametric MANO model through differentiable optimization,
resolving joint kinematics, shape parameters, and sensor misalignment during a
single streamlined calibration. The system achieves state-of-the-art accuracy,
with joint angle errors of less than 2.7 degree, and outperforms commercial
alternatives in shape reconstruction and contact fidelity. FSGlove's
open-source hardware and software design ensures compatibility with current VR
and robotics ecosystems, while its ability to capture subtle motions (e.g.,

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RetoVLA is a lightweight Vision-Language-Action model that reuses discarded Register Tokens from Vision Transformers to enhance spatial reasoning, achieving 17.1% improvement in robot manipulation tasks without sacrificing efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models are too large and computationally expensive for real-world deployment, and conventional lightweighting methods sacrifice critical spatial reasoning capabilities, creating an efficiency-performance trade-off.

Method: The proposed RetoVLA architecture reuses Register Tokens (previously discarded as artifacts in Vision Transformers) by directly injecting them into the Action Expert, leveraging their spatial information to enhance reasoning while maintaining a lightweight structure.

Result: On a custom 7-DOF robot arm, RetoVLA achieved a 17.1% absolute improvement in success rates for complex manipulation tasks compared to conventional approaches.

Conclusion: Register Tokens contain valuable spatial information that was previously discarded as artifacts, and reusing them directly enhances spatial reasoning in robotic intelligence, demonstrating that what was considered waste is actually an unexplored resource.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate remarkable
generalization in robotics but are restricted by their substantial size and
computational cost, limiting real-world deployment. However, conventional
lightweighting methods often sacrifice critical capabilities, particularly
spatial reasoning. This creates a trade-off between efficiency and performance.
To address this challenge, our work reuses Register Tokens, which were
introduced for artifact removal in Vision Transformers but subsequently
discarded. We suppose that these tokens contain essential spatial information
and propose RetoVLA, a novel architecture that reuses them directly by
injecting them into the Action Expert.
  RetoVLA maintains a lightweight structure while leveraging this repurposed
spatial context to enhance reasoning. We demonstrate RetoVLA's effectiveness
through a series of comprehensive experiments. On our custom-built 7-DOF robot
arm, the model achieves a 17.1%p absolute improvement in success rates for
complex manipulation tasks. Our results confirm that reusing Register Tokens
directly enhances spatial reasoning, demonstrating that what was previously
discarded as an artifact is in fact a valuable, unexplored resource for robotic

TL;DR: BiNoMaP introduces a dual-arm framework for bimanual non-prehensile manipulation that learns from video demonstrations and enables category-level generalization through parameterized primitives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-prehensile manipulation (pushing, poking, pivoting) is critical but underexplored due to contact-rich complexity. Current approaches rely on single-arm setups with external assistance or RL methods, which have limitations in generalizability.

Method: Three-stage RL-free framework: 1) Extract bimanual motion trajectories from video demonstrations, 2) Geometry-aware post-optimization refines trajectories into executable primitives, 3) Parameterize primitives with object geometric attributes (size) for generalization.

Result: Validated across diverse bimanual tasks and object categories, demonstrating effectiveness, efficiency, versatility, and superior generalization capability compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: BiNoMaP provides a generalizable solution for bimanual non-prehensile manipulation that moves beyond single-arm setups and RL dependencies, enabling category-level adaptation through parameterized primitives learned from visual demonstrations.

Abstract: Non-prehensile manipulation, encompassing ungraspable actions such as
pushing, poking, and pivoting, represents a critical yet underexplored domain
in robotics due to its contact-rich and analytically intractable nature. In
this work, we revisit this problem from two novel perspectives. First, we move
beyond the usual single-arm setup and the strong assumption of favorable
external dexterity such as walls, ramps, or edges. Instead, we advocate a
generalizable dual-arm configuration and establish a suite of Bimanual
Non-prehensile Manipulation Primitives (BiNoMaP). Second, we depart from the
prevailing RL-based paradigm and propose a three-stage, RL-free framework to
learn non-prehensile skills. Specifically, we begin by extracting bimanual hand
motion trajectories from video demonstrations. Due to visual inaccuracies and
morphological gaps, these coarse trajectories are difficult to transfer
directly to robotic end-effectors. To address this, we propose a geometry-aware
post-optimization algorithm that refines raw motions into executable
manipulation primitives that conform to specific motion patterns. Beyond
instance-level reproduction, we further enable category-level generalization by
parameterizing the learned primitives with object-relevant geometric
attributes, particularly size, resulting in adaptable and general parameterized
manipulation primitives. We validate BiNoMaP across a range of representative
bimanual tasks and diverse object categories, demonstrating its effectiveness,
efficiency, versatility, and superior generalization capability.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GMP³ is a multiphase global path planning framework that generates dynamically feasible 3D trajectories for UAVs in cluttered environments by extending planning to SE(3) Lie group and using reinforcement learning with consensus-based cooperative policy updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional path planning methods operate in Euclidean position spaces and don't adequately handle the joint translational and rotational dynamics required for UAV navigation in constrained 3D environments.

Method: Extends path planning to SE(3) Lie group, introduces modified Bellman-based operator for RL policy updates, uses distributed framework with consensus-based scheme where agents refine trajectory segments cooperatively, and integrates with DroneManager software for real UAV deployment.

Result: Simulation studies and indoor flight experiments show effective obstacle avoidance and smooth, feasible trajectories across both position and orientation in constrained 3D environments.

Conclusion: GMP³ provides a robust framework for generating dynamically feasible 3D trajectories for UAVs, enabling reliable navigation in cluttered environments through cooperative learning and real-time deployment capabilities.

Abstract: We propose $\text{GMP}^{3}$, a multiphase global path planning framework that
generates dynamically feasible three-dimensional trajectories for unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in cluttered environments. The framework
extends traditional path planning from Euclidean position spaces to the Lie
group $\mathrm{SE}(3)$, allowing joint learning of translational motion and
rotational dynamics. A modified Bellman-based operator is introduced to support
reinforcement learning (RL) policy updates while leveraging prior trajectory
information for improved convergence. $\text{GMP}^{3}$ is designed as a
distributed framework in which agents influence each other and share policy
information along the trajectory: each agent refines its assigned segment and
shares with its neighbors via a consensus-based scheme, enabling cooperative
policy updates and convergence toward a path shaped globally even under
kinematic constraints. We also propose DroneManager, a modular ground control
software that interfaces the planner with real UAV platforms via the MAVLink
protocol, supporting real-time deployment and feedback. Simulation studies and
indoor flight experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in
constrained 3D environments, demonstrating reliable obstacle avoidance and

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces GPHDM, a novel approach that learns latent representations preserving hierarchical structure and temporal dynamics for physically-consistent human-like motion generation in robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current motion generation models overlook hierarchical taxonomies from biomechanical studies, creating a disconnect between generated motions and their underlying structure.

Method: Extends GPDM dynamics prior to hyperbolic manifold and integrates taxonomy-aware inductive biases, proposing three mechanisms: two probabilistic recursive approaches and pullback-metric geodesics.

Result: Experiments on hand grasping taxonomy show GPHDM faithfully encodes taxonomy and temporal dynamics while generating novel physically-consistent trajectories.

Conclusion: GPHDM successfully bridges the gap between hierarchical motion taxonomies and physically-consistent motion generation for robotics.

Abstract: Human-like motion generation for robots often draws inspiration from
biomechanical studies, which often categorize complex human motions into
hierarchical taxonomies. While these taxonomies provide rich structural
information about how movements relate to one another, this information is
frequently overlooked in motion generation models, leading to a disconnect
between the generated motions and their underlying hierarchical structure. This
paper introduces the \ac{gphdm}, a novel approach that learns latent
representations preserving both the hierarchical structure of motions and their
temporal dynamics to ensure physical consistency. Our model achieves this by
extending the dynamics prior of the Gaussian Process Dynamical Model (GPDM) to
the hyperbolic manifold and integrating it with taxonomy-aware inductive
biases. Building on this geometry- and taxonomy-aware frameworks, we propose
three novel mechanisms for generating motions that are both
taxonomically-structured and physically-consistent: two probabilistic recursive
approaches and a method based on pullback-metric geodesics. Experiments on
generating realistic motion sequences on the hand grasping taxonomy show that
the proposed GPHDM faithfully encodes the underlying taxonomy and temporal
dynamics, and generates novel physically-consistent trajectories.

### [136] [An Approach to Checking Correctness for Agentic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20364)
*Thomas J Sheffler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A temporal expression language for monitoring AI agent behavior that detects deviations from expected behavioral patterns by analyzing execution traces rather than text matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current error-detection approaches rely on fragile text matching of LLM inputs/outputs, which fails due to natural language variability. A more robust method is needed to verify agent behavior independent of specific textual outputs.

Method: Uses temporal logic techniques from hardware verification to monitor execution traces of agent tool calls and state transitions. Provides assertions that capture correct behavioral patterns across multiple execution scenarios.

Result: Demonstrated on a three-agent system: when using capable models, all temporal assertions were satisfied, but when smaller models were substituted, executions violated behavioral assertions due to improper tool sequencing and failed coordination.

Conclusion: The temporal expression language effectively detects behavioral regressions in AI agent systems and provides a foundation for systematic monitoring of agent reliability in critical applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a temporal expression language for monitoring AI agent
behavior, enabling systematic error-detection of LLM-based agentic systems that
exhibit variable outputs due to stochastic generation processes. Drawing from
temporal logic techniques used in hardware verification, this approach monitors
execution traces of agent tool calls and state transitions to detect deviations
from expected behavioral patterns. Current error-detection approaches rely
primarily on text matching of inputs and outputs, which proves fragile due to
the natural language variability inherent in LLM responses. The proposed method
instead focuses on the sequence of agent actions -- such as tool invocations
and inter-agent communications -- allowing verification of system behavior
independent of specific textual outputs. The temporal expression language
provides assertions that capture correct behavioral patterns across multiple
execution scenarios. These assertions serve dual purposes: validating prompt
engineering and guardrail effectiveness during development, and providing
regression testing when agents are updated with new LLMs or modified logic. The
approach is demonstrated using a three-agent system, where agents coordinate to
solve multi-step reasoning tasks. When powered by large, capable models, all
temporal assertions were satisfied across many test runs. However, when smaller
models were substituted in two of the three agents, executions violated
behavioral assertions, primarily due to improper tool sequencing and failed
coordination handoffs. The temporal expressions successfully flagged these
anomalies, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for detecting behavioral
regressions in production agentic systems. This approach provides a foundation
for systematic monitoring of AI agent reliability as these systems become

### [137] [LATTS: Locally Adaptive Test-Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20368)
*Theo Uscidda,Matthew Trager,Michael Kleinman,Aditya Chattopadhyay,Wei Xia,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LATTS is a method that adaptively allocates computation during LLM generation by using a verifier model to determine when to resample, backtrack, restart, or stop based on local difficulty at each step.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current verifier-based methods for improving LLM performance increase computation uniformly across all samples and generation steps, leading to inefficient resource use without considering individual instance complexity.

Method: LATTS employs a verifier-based acceptance criterion at each generation step to dynamically decide whether to resample, backtrack, restart, or stop, adjusting computational effort based on local difficulty derived from the verifier model.

Result: Empirical results show LATTS achieves significantly superior accuracy-compute tradeoffs compared to standard verifier-based methods.

Conclusion: LATTS provides an efficient approach to test-time scaling by adaptively allocating computation based on local difficulty, outperforming uniform computation allocation methods.

Abstract: One common strategy for improving the performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs) on downstream tasks involves using a \emph{verifier model} to either
select the best answer from a pool of candidates or to steer the
auto-regressive generation process towards better outputs. This class of
methods typically results in improved accuracy at the cost of increased
computation at test-time, a paradigm known as \emph{test-time scaling}.
However, most existing approaches increase computation uniformly across all
samples and generation steps, without considering the complexity of individual
instances, leading to inefficient resource use. We address this limitation by
proposing an approach, called \emph{Locally Adaptive Test-Time Scaling
(LATTS)}, that allocates variable compute across generation steps.
Specifically, at each generation step, LATTS employs a verifier-based
acceptance criterion to decide whether to resample, backtrack, restart, or stop
the generation process. This criterion effectively adjusts the per-step
computational effort based on a precise notion of \emph{local difficulty}
derived from the verifier model. Empirical results show that LATTS achieves
significantly superior accuracy--compute tradeoffs compared to standard
verifier-based methods.

*Samer Alshaer,Ala Khalifeh,Roman Obermaisser*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel reconstruction framework for adaptive scheduling in time-triggered systems that dynamically validates and assembles schedules while ensuring safety and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in time-triggered systems including message collisions, locked loops from incorrect precedence handling, and generation of incomplete/invalid schedules that compromise system safety.

Method: Systematically transforms AI-generated or heuristic scheduling priorities into executable schedules with safety checks, allocation algorithms, and recovery mechanisms for handling unexpected events.

Result: Significantly enhances system adaptability, operational integrity, and runtime performance while maintaining computational efficiency across various performance profiles.

Conclusion: Provides a practical and scalable solution for safe schedule generation in safety-critical TTS, enabling reliable real-time scheduling under dynamic and uncertain conditions.

Abstract: Adaptive scheduling is crucial for ensuring the reliability and safety of
time-triggered systems (TTS) in dynamic operational environments. Scheduling
frameworks face significant challenges, including message collisions, locked
loops from incorrect precedence handling, and the generation of incomplete or
invalid schedules, which can compromise system safety and performance. To
address these challenges, this paper presents a novel reconstruction framework
designed to dynamically validate and assemble schedules. The proposed
reconstruction models operate by systematically transforming AI-generated or
heuristically derived scheduling priorities into fully executable schedules,
ensuring adherence to critical system constraints such as precedence rules and
collision-free communication. It incorporates robust safety checks, efficient
allocation algorithms, and recovery mechanisms to handle unexpected context
events, including hardware failures and mode transitions. Comprehensive
experiments were conducted across multiple performance profiles, including
makespan minimisation, workload balancing, and energy efficiency, to validate
the operational effectiveness of the reconstruction models. Results demonstrate
that the proposed framework significantly enhances system adaptability,
operational integrity, and runtime performance while maintaining computational
efficiency. Overall, this work contributes a practical and scalable solution to
the problem of safe schedule generation in safety-critical TTS, enabling
reliable and flexible real-time scheduling even under highly dynamic and
uncertain operational conditions.

### [141] [Adaptive Approach to Enhance Machine Learning Scheduling Algorithms During Runtime Using Reinforcement Learning in Metascheduling Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20520)
*Samer Alshaer,Ala Khalifeh,Roman Obermaisser*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes an adaptive online learning unit using Reinforcement Learning to overcome limitations of offline AI scheduling training in time-triggered architectures, enabling real-time adaptation to dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional offline training for AI scheduling inferences struggles with constructing comprehensive Multi-Schedule Graphs (MSG) that account for all possible scenarios like hardware failures and mode changes, which is resource-intensive and often infeasible.

Method: Integration of an adaptive online learning unit within the metascheduler that uses Reinforcement Learning models to continuously explore and discover new scheduling solutions, expanding the MSG and optimizing existing schedulers in real-time.

Result: The system becomes capable of handling unexpected events and complex scheduling scenarios more effectively, maintaining flexibility to meet evolving demands with stricter deadlines or new performance criteria.

Conclusion: The proposed online RL-based approach ensures robustness and efficiency in large-scale, safety-critical environments by enabling dynamic adaptation and continuous refinement of AI scheduling inferences through real-time training.

Abstract: Metascheduling in time-triggered architectures has been crucial in adapting
to dynamic and unpredictable environments, ensuring the reliability and
efficiency of task execution. However, traditional approaches face significant
challenges when training Artificial Intelligence (AI) scheduling inferences
offline, particularly due to the complexities involved in constructing a
comprehensive Multi-Schedule Graph (MSG) that accounts for all possible
scenarios. The process of generating an MSG that captures the vast probability
space, especially when considering context events like hardware failures, slack
variations, or mode changes, is resource-intensive and often infeasible. To
address these challenges, we propose an adaptive online learning unit
integrated within the metascheduler to enhance performance in real-time. The
primary motivation for developing this unit stems from the limitations of
offline training, where the MSG created is inherently a subset of the complete
space, focusing only on the most probable and critical context events. In the
online mode, Reinforcement Learning (RL) plays a pivotal role by continuously
exploring and discovering new scheduling solutions, thus expanding the MSG and
enhancing system performance over time. This dynamic adaptation allows the
system to handle unexpected events and complex scheduling scenarios more
effectively. Several RL models were implemented within the online learning
unit, each designed to address specific challenges in scheduling. These models
not only facilitate the discovery of new solutions but also optimize existing
schedulers, particularly when stricter deadlines or new performance criteria
are introduced. By continuously refining the AI inferences through real-time
training, the system remains flexible and capable of meeting evolving demands,
thus ensuring robustness and efficiency in large-scale, safety-critical
environments.

*Pawel Trajdos,Marek Kurzynski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A fuzzy recognition system for EMG-based hand prosthesis control that detects contaminated biosignals using one-class classifiers and KNN ensembles to improve classification quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EMG biosignals for prosthesis control are highly susceptible to contamination, which significantly reduces classification quality and system reliability.

Method: Two-stage system: one-class classifiers detect contaminated channels, KNN ensemble recognizes patient intent, both using a coherent fuzzy model with uniform soft decision scheme.

Result: Experimental evaluation using real biosignals showed comparative analysis of method parameters and procedures affecting recognition quality, with comparison to existing literature systems.

Conclusion: The proposed fuzzy recognition system effectively mitigates adverse effects of biosignal contamination in prosthesis control through integrated contamination detection and intent recognition.

Abstract: Modern anthropomorphic upper limb bioprostheses are typically controlled by
electromyographic (EMG) biosignals using a pattern recognition scheme.
Unfortunately, there are many factors originating from the human source of
objects to be classified and from the human-prosthesis interface that make it
difficult to obtain an acceptable classification quality. One of these factors
is the high susceptibility of biosignals to contamination, which can
considerably reduce the quality of classification of a recognition system.
  In the paper, the authors propose a new recognition system intended for EMG
based control of the hand prosthesis with detection of contaminated biosignals
in order to mitigate the adverse effect of contaminations. The system consists
of two ensembles: the set of one-class classifiers (OCC) to assess the degree
of contamination of individual channels and the ensemble of K-nearest
neighbours (KNN) classifier to recognise the patient's intent. For all
recognition systems, an original, coherent fuzzy model was developed, which
allows the use of a uniform soft (fuzzy) decision scheme throughout the
recognition process. The experimental evaluation was conducted using real
biosignals from a public repository. The goal was to provide an experimental
comparative analysis of the parameters and procedures of the developed method
on which the quality of the recognition system depends. The proposed fuzzy
recognition system was also compared with similar systems described in the
literature.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAMULE is a framework for self-learning LLM agents that uses multi-level reflection synthesis to generate high-quality reflections across micro, meso, and macro levels, significantly outperforming existing reflection-based approaches on complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents struggle with meaningful reflections due to inadequate error analysis and reliance on rare successful trajectories, especially in complex tasks.

Method: Proposes SAMULE framework with Multi-Level Reflection Synthesis: Single-Trajectory Learning (micro-level) for detailed error correction, Intra-Task Learning (meso-level) for error taxonomies across multiple trials, and Inter-Task Learning (macro-level) for transferable insights from diverse task failures. Fine-tunes a retrospective language model and extends to interactive settings with foresight-based reflection.

Result: Extensive experiments on TravelPlanner, NATURAL PLAN, and Tau-bench show SAMULE significantly outperforms reflection-based baselines.

Conclusion: Well-designed reflection synthesis and failure-centric learning are critical for building self-improving LLM agents.

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in LLM agents, they still face the challenge
of generating meaningful reflections due to inadequate error analysis and a
reliance on rare successful trajectories, especially in complex tasks. In this
work, we propose SAMULE, a new framework for self-learning agents powered by a
retrospective language model that is trained based on Multi-Level Reflection
Synthesis. It first synthesizes high-quality reflections across three
complementary levels: Single-Trajectory Learning (micro-level) for detailed
error correction; Intra-Task Learning (meso-level) to build error taxonomies
across multiple trials of the same task, and Inter-Task Learning (macro-level)
to extract transferable insights based on same typed errors from diverse task
failures. Then we fine-tune a language model serving as the retrospective model
to generate reflections during inference. We further extend our framework to
interactive settings through a foresight-based reflection mechanism, enabling
agents to proactively reflect and adapt during user interactions by comparing
predicted and actual responses. Extensive experiments on three challenging
benchmarks - TravelPlanner, NATURAL PLAN, and Tau-bench - demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms reflection-based baselines. Our results
highlight the critical role of well-designed reflection synthesis and
failure-centric learning in building self-improving LLM agents.

provides an intelligent and scalable blueprint for safeguarding complex digital
infrastructure and is compatible with zero-trust models, thereby supporting the
adherence to international cybersecurity regulations.

Motivation: To create an automated system for radiotherapy plan evaluation that combines structured population-based scoring with transparent reasoning to minimize hallucination and provide traceable outputs.

Method: Used a multi-protocol dataset of 614 radiotherapy plans across four disease sites. Built a RAG system with three modules: retrieval engine (optimized across five SentenceTransformer backbones), percentile prediction based on cohort similarity, and clinical constraint checker, all directed by an LLM using multi-step prompt-driven reasoning.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates feasibility of combining structured population-based scoring with modular tool-augmented reasoning for transparent, scalable plan evaluation in radiation therapy, with robust performance across protocols.

Abstract: Purpose: To develop a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system powered by
LLaMA-4 109B for automated, protocol-aware, and interpretable evaluation of
radiotherapy treatment plans.
  Methods and Materials: We curated a multi-protocol dataset of 614
radiotherapy plans across four disease sites and constructed a knowledge base
containing normalized dose metrics and protocol-defined constraints. The RAG
system integrates three core modules: a retrieval engine optimized across five
SentenceTransformer backbones, a percentile prediction component based on
cohort similarity, and a clinical constraint checker. These tools are directed
by a large language model (LLM) using a multi-step prompt-driven reasoning
pipeline to produce concise, grounded evaluations.
  Results: Retrieval hyperparameters were optimized using Gaussian Process on a
scalarized loss function combining root mean squared error (RMSE), mean
absolute error (MAE), and clinically motivated accuracy thresholds. The best
configuration, based on all-MiniLM-L6-v2, achieved perfect nearest-neighbor
accuracy within a 5-percentile-point margin and a sub-2pt MAE. When tested
end-to-end, the RAG system achieved 100% agreement with the computed values by
standalone retrieval and constraint-checking modules on both percentile
estimates and constraint identification, confirming reliable execution of all
retrieval, prediction and checking steps.
  Conclusion: Our findings highlight the feasibility of combining structured
population-based scoring with modular tool-augmented reasoning for transparent,
scalable plan evaluation in radiation therapy. The system offers traceable
outputs, minimizes hallucination, and demonstrates robustness across protocols.
Future directions include clinician-led validation, and improved domain-adapted

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Fairy is an interactive multi-agent mobile assistant that addresses limitations of existing GUI agents by enabling cross-app collaboration, interactive execution, and continual learning through three core modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large multi-modal models struggle with real-world mobile GUI scenarios involving diverse app interfaces and evolving user needs. End-to-end methods fail on long-tail apps, and unilateral agent actions harm user experience.

Method: Fairy uses three modules: (i) Global Task Planner for cross-app task decomposition, (ii) App-Level Executor with dual-loop agents for precise execution and user interaction using long/short-term memory, and (iii) Self-Learner that consolidates experience into App Map and Tricks.

Result: Fairy with GPT-4o backbone outperforms previous state-of-the-art by improving user requirement completion by 33.7% and reducing redundant steps by 58.5% on the RealMobile-Eval benchmark.

Conclusion: Fairy demonstrates effective interaction and self-learning capabilities, showing significant improvements in mobile GUI task completion efficiency and user experience.

Abstract: Large multi-modal models (LMMs) have advanced mobile GUI agents. However,
existing methods struggle with real-world scenarios involving diverse app
interfaces and evolving user needs. End-to-end methods relying on model's
commonsense often fail on long-tail apps, and agents without user interaction
act unilaterally, harming user experience. To address these limitations, we
propose Fairy, an interactive multi-agent mobile assistant capable of
continuously accumulating app knowledge and self-evolving during usage. Fairy
enables cross-app collaboration, interactive execution, and continual learning
through three core modules:(i) a Global Task Planner that decomposes user tasks
into sub-tasks from a cross-app view; (ii) an App-Level Executor that refines
sub-tasks into steps and actions based on long- and short-term memory,
achieving precise execution and user interaction via four core agents operating
in dual loops; and (iii) a Self-Learner that consolidates execution experience
into App Map and Tricks. To evaluate Fairy, we introduce RealMobile-Eval, a
real-world benchmark with a comprehensive metric suite, and LMM-based agents
for automated scoring. Experiments show that Fairy with GPT-4o backbone
outperforms the previous SoTA by improving user requirement completion by 33.7%
and reducing redundant steps by 58.5%, showing the effectiveness of its

*Qihang Ai,Haiyun Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework combining auto-regressive and non-autoregressive models for reasoning tasks, using NAR for efficient intermediate reasoning and AR for precise final answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR models are slow for reasoning tasks requiring long chains of thought, while NAR models are fast but produce lower quality outputs. This work aims to leverage the strengths of both.

Method: Use NAR models to efficiently generate intermediate reasoning traces, then guide AR models with these traces to produce accurate final answers.

Result: 26% improvement over strong baselines while significantly reducing inference cost.

Conclusion: The hybrid AR-NAR approach effectively balances speed and quality for reasoning-intensive tasks.

Abstract: We study reasoning tasks through a framework that integrates auto-regressive
(AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) language models. AR models, which generate
text sequentially, excel at producing coherent outputs but often suffer from
slow inference, particularly in reasoning-intensive domains such as mathematics
and code, where lengthy chains of thought are required. In contrast, NAR
models, such as discrete diffusion models, allow parallel generation and offer
substantial speedups, though typically at the cost of reduced output quality.
To address these limitations, we introduce a new paradigm in which an NAR model
efficiently produces intermediate reasoning traces, which subsequently guide an
AR model to deliver precise final answers. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach yields significant 26% improvements over strong baselines while
substantially reducing inference cost.

TL;DR: Meta-Memory is an LLM-driven agent that creates high-density environmental memory representations, enabling robots to retrieve and integrate memories through semantic-spatial reasoning for answering natural language location queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots need effective memory systems to store observations and answer human spatial queries, but current approaches lack principled mechanisms for efficient memory retrieval and integration in complex environments.

Method: Proposes Meta-Memory, which constructs high-density memory representations and performs joint reasoning over semantic and spatial modalities to retrieve relevant memories for natural language location queries.

Result: Meta-Memory significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both the new SpaceLocQA dataset and public NaVQA benchmark, and was successfully deployed on real-world robotic platforms.

Conclusion: The proposed Meta-Memory framework provides robust spatial reasoning capabilities for robots in complex environments, demonstrating practical utility through real-world deployment.

Abstract: Navigating complex environments requires robots to effectively store
observations as memories and leverage them to answer human queries about
spatial locations, which is a critical yet underexplored research challenge.
While prior work has made progress in constructing robotic memory, few have
addressed the principled mechanisms needed for efficient memory retrieval and
integration. To bridge this gap, we propose Meta-Memory, a large language model
(LLM)-driven agent that constructs a high-density memory representation of the
environment. The key innovation of Meta-Memory lies in its capacity to retrieve
and integrate relevant memories through joint reasoning over semantic and
spatial modalities in response to natural language location queries, thereby
empowering robots with robust and accurate spatial reasoning capabilities. To
evaluate its performance, we introduce SpaceLocQA, a large-scale dataset
encompassing diverse real-world spatial question-answering scenarios.
Experimental results show that Meta-Memory significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on both the SpaceLocQA and the public NaVQA
benchmarks. Furthermore, we successfully deployed Meta-Memory on real-world
robotic platforms, demonstrating its practical utility in complex environments.

TL;DR: LogReasoner is a coarse-to-fine reasoning enhancement framework that enables LLMs to perform expert-level log analysis by structuring reasoning workflows and refining analytical granularity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose LLMs struggle with structured reasoning workflows that align with expert cognition in log analysis tasks, lacking precision in reasoning steps for system monitoring and failure diagnosis.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) coarse-grained enhancement using expert troubleshooting flowcharts to structure reasoning workflows, (2) fine-grained enhancement through task-specific fine-tuning and preference learning to calibrate reasoning details from mistakes.

Result: LogReasoner significantly outperforms existing LLMs on four log analysis tasks using Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances LLMs' reasoning capabilities for log analysis, demonstrating improved analytical granularity and correctness compared to general-purpose LLMs.

Abstract: Log analysis is crucial for monitoring system health and diagnosing failures
in complex systems. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for automated log analysis, leveraging their reasoning
capabilities to perform tasks such as anomaly detection and failure prediction.
However, general-purpose LLMs struggle to formulate structured reasoning
workflows that align with expert cognition and deliver precise details of
reasoning steps. To address these challenges, we propose LogReasoner, a
coarse-to-fine reasoning enhancement framework designed to enable LLMs to
reason log analysis tasks like experts. LogReasoner consists of two stages: (1)
coarse-grained enhancement of expert thinking, where high-level expert thoughts
are constructed from collected troubleshooting flowcharts and existing tasks to
enable LLMs to formulate structured reasoning workflows and (2) fine-grained
enhancement of specific steps, where we first fine-tune the LLM with
task-specific stepwise solutions to enhance the LLM for instantiated reasoning,
then employ the preference learning to calibrate the LLM's reasoning details
from its mistakes, further strengthen the LLM's analytical granularity and
correctness. We evaluate LogReasoner on four distinct log analysis tasks using
open-source LLMs such as Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3. Experimental results show that
LogReasoner significantly outperforms existing LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art
performance and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs for log analysis.

Result: Experiments on diverse benchmarks show that DeFacto substantially improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, establishing a stronger foundation for interpretable multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: DeFacto successfully addresses the reasoning fidelity challenge in multimodal language models by jointly enforcing accurate answering and faithful reasoning through counterfactual training and reinforcement learning, leading to more interpretable and reliable multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal language models (MLLMs) have achieved
remarkable progress in vision-language reasoning, especially with the emergence
of "thinking with images," which integrates explicit visual steps into the
reasoning process. While this paradigm strengthens image-based reasoning, a
significant challenge remains: models may arrive at correct answers by relying
on irrelevant or spurious regions, driven by prior knowledge or dataset biases.
Even when the answer is correct, flawed reasoning indicates that the model has
not truly understood the image, highlighting the critical importance of
reasoning fidelity in multimodal tasks. To address this issue, we propose
DeFacto, a counterfactual reasoning framework that jointly enforces accurate
answering and faithful reasoning. A key component of our approach is the design
of three complementary training paradigms: (i) positive, (ii) counterfactual,
and (iii) random-masking. To enable these paradigms, we develop a pipeline that
automatically localizes question-relevant evidence and constructs positive,
counterfactual, and random variants, resulting in a dataset of about 100k
images. Building on this framework, we train multimodal language models with
GRPO-based reinforcement learning, where we design three complementary rewards
to guide the model toward accurate answering and evidence-grounded reasoning.
Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that DeFacto substantially
improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, establishing a
stronger foundation for interpretable multimodal reasoning. The code is
available on GitHub and the dataset is released on HuggingFace.

### [152] [GALAX: Graph-Augmented Language Model for Explainable Reinforcement-Guided Subgraph Reasoning in Precision Medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20935)
*Heming Zhang,Di Huang,Wenyu Li,Michael Province,Yixin Chen,Philip Payne,Fuhai Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GALAX integrates Graph Neural Networks with Large Language Models using reinforcement learning guided by a Graph Process Reward Model to enable explainable subgraph reasoning for precision medicine target discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches in precision medicine have limitations: numerical omics ignore topological context, text-centric LLMs lack quantitative reasoning, and graph models underuse node semantics. There's a need to integrate quantitative multi-omic signals, topological structure, and literature-scale text for better mechanistic interpretability.

Method: Proposed GALAX framework integrates pretrained GNNs into LLMs via reinforcement learning guided by GPRM. It generates disease-relevant subgraphs step-wise, initiated by LLM and iteratively evaluated by pretrained GNN, enabling process-level supervision without explicit intermediate reasoning annotations.

Result: Introduced Target-QA benchmark combining CRISPR-identified targets, multi-omic profiles, and biomedical graph knowledge across cancer cell lines. This enables GNN pretraining for supervising step-wise graph construction and supports long-context reasoning over text-numeric graphs.

Conclusion: GALAX provides a scalable and biologically grounded framework for explainable, reinforcement-guided subgraph reasoning toward reliable and interpretable target and pathway discovery in precision medicine.

Abstract: In precision medicine, quantitative multi-omic features, topological context,
and textual biological knowledge play vital roles in identifying
disease-critical signaling pathways and targets. Existing pipelines capture
only part of these-numerical omics ignore topological context, text-centric
LLMs lack quantitative grounded reasoning, and graph-only models underuse node
semantics and the generalization of LLMs-limiting mechanistic interpretability.
Although Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to guide reasoning in LLMs, they
remain limited by unreliable intermediate evaluation, and vulnerability to
reward hacking with computational cost. These gaps motivate integrating
quantitative multi-omic signals, topological structure with node annotations,
and literature-scale text via LLMs, using subgraph reasoning as the principle
bridge linking numeric evidence, topological knowledge and language context.
Therefore, we propose GALAX (Graph Augmented LAnguage model with
eXplainability), an innovative framework that integrates pretrained Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) into Large Language Models (LLMs) via reinforcement
guided by a Graph Process Reward Model (GPRM), which generates disease-relevant
subgraphs in a step-wise manner initiated by an LLM and iteratively evaluated
by a pretrained GNN, enabling process-level supervision without explicit
intermediate reasoning annotations. As an application, we also introduced
Target-QA, a benchmark combining CRISPR-identified targets, multi-omic
profiles, and biomedical graph knowledge across diverse cancer cell lines,
which enables GNN pretraining for supervising step-wise graph construction and
supports long-context reasoning over text-numeric graphs (TNGs), providing a
scalable and biologically grounded framework for explainable,
reinforcement-guided subgraph reasoning toward reliable and interpretable
target and pathway discovery in precision medicine.

*Najla Zuhir,Amna Mohammad Salim,Parvathy Premkumar,Moshiur Farazi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a modular LLM-based framework for mobile app review analysis that addresses limitations of traditional star-rating systems and NLP methods by capturing nuanced feedback through structured prompting and retrieval-augmented QA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Star ratings fail to capture nuanced feedback in detailed review texts, and traditional NLP techniques struggle with contextual nuances, domain-specific terminology, and subtle linguistic features like sarcasm.

Method: Modular framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) enhanced by structured prompting techniques, quantifying rating-text sentiment discrepancies, extracting feature-level insights, and supporting interactive exploration through retrieval-augmented conversational question answering (RAG-QA).

Result: Comprehensive experiments on three diverse datasets (AWARE, Google Play, Spotify) demonstrate significant superiority over baseline methods with improved accuracy, robustness, and actionable insights in challenging review scenarios.

Conclusion: LLM-driven approach effectively overcomes limitations of traditional methods, providing more accurate and nuanced analysis of mobile app reviews with enhanced contextual understanding and interactive exploration capabilities.

Abstract: We present an advanced approach to mobile app review analysis aimed at
addressing limitations inherent in traditional star-rating systems. Star
ratings, although intuitive and popular among users, often fail to capture the
nuanced feedback present in detailed review texts. Traditional NLP techniques
-- such as lexicon-based methods and classical machine learning classifiers --
struggle to interpret contextual nuances, domain-specific terminology, and
subtle linguistic features like sarcasm. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a modular framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) enhanced by
structured prompting techniques. Our method quantifies discrepancies between
numerical ratings and textual sentiment, extracts detailed, feature-level
insights, and supports interactive exploration of reviews through
retrieval-augmented conversational question answering (RAG-QA). Comprehensive
experiments conducted on three diverse datasets (AWARE, Google Play, and
Spotify) demonstrate that our LLM-driven approach significantly surpasses
baseline methods, yielding improved accuracy, robustness, and actionable
insights in challenging and context-rich review scenarios.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AOT* is a framework that combines LLM-generated chemical synthesis pathways with AND-OR tree search to improve retrosynthesis planning efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-step retrosynthetic planning faces computational challenges due to exponential search spaces and high inference costs, while existing LLM approaches have efficiency and cost constraints.

Method: AOT* integrates LLM-generated synthesis pathways with systematic AND-OR tree search, using atomic mapping of synthesis routes onto tree components, reward assignment strategy, and retrieval-based context engineering.

Result: AOT* achieves state-of-the-art performance with 3-5× fewer iterations than existing LLM-based approaches, with efficiency advantages becoming more pronounced on complex molecular targets.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables LLMs to efficiently navigate chemical space for retrosynthesis planning, demonstrating significant improvements in search efficiency while maintaining competitive solve rates.

Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning enables the discovery of viable synthetic routes for
target molecules, playing a crucial role in domains like drug discovery and
materials design. Multi-step retrosynthetic planning remains computationally
challenging due to exponential search spaces and inference costs. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate chemical reasoning capabilities, their
application to synthesis planning faces constraints on efficiency and cost. To
address these challenges, we introduce AOT*, a framework that transforms
retrosynthetic planning by integrating LLM-generated chemical synthesis
pathways with systematic AND-OR tree search. To this end, AOT* atomically maps
the generated complete synthesis routes onto AND-OR tree components, with a
mathematically sound design of reward assignment strategy and retrieval-based
context engineering, thus enabling LLMs to efficiently navigate in the chemical
space. Experimental evaluation on multiple synthesis benchmarks demonstrates
that AOT* achieves SOTA performance with significantly improved search
efficiency. AOT* exhibits competitive solve rates using 3-5$\times$ fewer
iterations than existing LLM-based approaches, with the efficiency advantage
becoming more pronounced on complex molecular targets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agent benchmarks focus only on binary final-state judgments, overlooking critical aspects like safety, efficiency, and intermediate correctness in real-world task execution.

Method: Proposed a DFA-based framework that encodes tasks as valid tool-use paths, enabling principled assessment of agent behavior across diverse world models with the CORE metric suite.

Result: The method reveals significant performance differences between agents that appear equivalent under traditional evaluation schemes, demonstrating the importance of comprehensive assessment.

Conclusion: The DFA-based framework and CORE metrics provide a more nuanced and comprehensive evaluation approach for AI agents, capturing critical aspects of task execution that traditional methods miss.

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents that solve real-world tasks through function-call
sequences remains an open challenge. Existing agentic benchmarks often reduce
evaluation to a binary judgment of the final state, overlooking critical
aspects such as safety, efficiency, and intermediate correctness. We propose a
framework based on deterministic finite automata (DFAs) that encodes tasks as
sets of valid tool-use paths, enabling principled assessment of agent behavior
in diverse world models. Building on this foundation, we introduce CORE, a
suite of five metrics, namely Path Correctness, Path Correctness - Kendall's
tau Composite, Prefix Criticality, Harmful-Call Rate, and Efficiency, that
quantify alignment with expected execution patterns. Across diverse worlds, our
method reveals important performance differences between agents that would
otherwise appear equivalent under traditional final-state evaluation schemes.

*Miao Li,Alexander Gurung,Irina Saparina,Mirella Lapata*

TL;DR: SciTrek is a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs' long-context reasoning using scientific articles, featuring complex questions requiring information synthesis across multiple papers with verifiable SQL-based reasoning steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current long-context benchmarks use non-scientific texts, focus on simple retrieval, or employ artificial contexts, lacking proper evaluation of complex reasoning across scientific literature.

Method: Automatically generate questions and answers using SQL queries over a database of article metadata, providing explicit reasoning steps and scaling to 1M token contexts with minimal supervision.

Result: Experiments show SciTrek poses significant challenges as context length increases, with limited gains from fine-tuning and RL, revealing systematic model weaknesses in numerical operations and information location.

Conclusion: SciTrek effectively exposes LLMs' limitations in long-context scientific reasoning and provides a scalable framework for detailed error analysis of complex information synthesis tasks.

Abstract: This paper introduces SciTrek, a novel question-answering benchmark designed
to evaluate the long-context reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) using scientific articles. Current long-context benchmarks often rely on
non-scientific texts, focus on simple information retrieval tasks, or employ
artificial contexts. SciTrek addresses these limitations by proposing complex
questions that require information aggregation and synthesis across multiple
full-text scientific articles. Questions and their ground-truth answers are
automatically generated by formulating them as SQL queries over a database
constructed from article metadata (titles, authors, and references). The SQL
operations provide explicit, verifiable reasoning steps for fine-grained error
analysis, and the construction process scales to contexts up to 1M tokens with
minimal supervision. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of open-weight and
proprietary LLMs demonstrate that SciTrek poses a significant challenge as the
context length increases, with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning offering only limited gains. Our analysis reveals systematic
shortcomings in models' abilities to perform basic numerical operations and
accurately locate specific information in long contexts.

*Yang Zhao,Chengxiao Dai,Wei Zhuo,Yue Xiu,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CLAUSE is a neuro-symbolic framework that treats knowledge graph context construction as a sequential decision process, optimizing for accuracy, latency, and cost trade-offs using multi-agent reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like static k-hop expansions and "think-longer" prompting often over-retrieve, inflate context, and yield unpredictable runtime, failing to balance accuracy with strict latency and cost targets while preserving provenance.

Method: CLAUSE uses Lagrangian-Constrained Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LC-MAPPO) to coordinate three agents (Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, Context Curator) for joint optimization of subgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection under user-specified resource budgets.

Result: On MetaQA-2-hop, CLAUSE achieves +39.3 EM@1 with 18.6% lower latency and 40.9% lower edge growth compared to GraphRAG. It consistently yields higher accuracy while reducing subgraph growth and latency across HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG.

Conclusion: CLAUSE provides compact, provenance-preserving contexts with predictable performance under deployment constraints, enabling per-query adaptation to accuracy-latency-cost trade-offs without retraining.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs provide structured context for multi-hop question answering,
but deployed systems must balance answer accuracy with strict latency and cost
targets while preserving provenance. Static k-hop expansions and "think-longer"
prompting often over-retrieve, inflate context, and yield unpredictable
runtime. We introduce CLAUSE, an agentic three-agent neuro-symbolic framework
that treats context construction as a sequential decision process over
knowledge graphs, deciding what to expand, which paths to follow or backtrack,
what evidence to keep, and when to stop. Latency (interaction steps) and prompt
cost (selected tokens) are exposed as user-specified budgets or prices,
allowing per-query adaptation to trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost
without retraining. CLAUSE employs the proposed Lagrangian-Constrained
Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LC-MAPPO) algorithm to coordinate
three agents: Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, and Context Curator, so that
subgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection are
jointly optimized under per-query resource budgets on edge edits, interaction
steps, and selected tokens. Across HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG, CLAUSE yields
higher EM@1 while reducing subgraph growth and end-to-end latency at equal or
lower token budgets. On MetaQA-2-hop, relative to the strongest RAG baseline
(GraphRAG), CLAUSE achieves +39.3 EM@1 with 18.6% lower latency and 40.9% lower
edge growth. The resulting contexts are compact, provenance-preserving, and
deliver predictable performance under deployment constraints.

*Samuel Schapiro,Sumuk Shashidhar,Alexi Gladstone,Jonah Black,Royce Moon,Dilek Hakkani-Tur,Lav R. Varshney*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a theoretical framework for evaluating combinatorial creativity in LLMs, focusing on novelty and utility rather than accuracy. It reveals scaling patterns, optimal model architectures, and a persistent novelty-utility tradeoff that limits LLMs' creative potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks fail to address LLMs' creative abilities in scientific idea generation, which requires evaluating open-ended outputs rather than fixed correctness targets.

Method: Proposed theoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating creativity through novelty and utility metrics, with empirical analysis of scaling behavior, model architecture effects, and tradeoffs.

Result: Found optimal model depths/widths for creativity, identified ideation-execution gap, and discovered persistent novelty-utility tradeoff that remains even at scale.

Conclusion: The persistent tradeoff casts doubt on LLMs' long-term creative potential in current form, but the framework provides foundation for understanding and improving AI creativity as a new generalization frontier.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and large language models (LLMs) in
particular, are increasingly employed for creative tasks like scientific idea
generation, constituting a form of generalization from training data
unaddressed by existing conceptual frameworks. Though in many ways similar to
forms of compositional generalization (CG), combinatorial creativity (CC) is an
open-ended ability. Instead of evaluating for accuracy or correctness against
fixed targets, which would contradict the open-ended nature of CC, we propose a
theoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating outputs by their
degrees of novelty and utility. From here, we make several important empirical
contributions: (1) We obtain the first insights into the scaling behavior of
creativity for LLMs. (2) We discover that, for fixed compute budgets, there
exist optimal model depths and widths for creative ability. (3) We find that
the ideation-execution gap, whereby LLMs excel at generating novel scientific
ideas but struggle to ensure their practical feasibility, may be explained by a
more fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff characteristic of creativity
algorithms in general. Importantly, this tradeoff remains persistent even at
scale, casting doubt on the long-term creative potential of LLMs in their
current form. Together, our conceptual framework and empirical findings provide
a foundation for understanding and improving creativity in modern AI models,
marking a new frontier in generalization abilities.

*Haodong Zhao,Jidong Li,Zhaomin Wu,Tianjie Ju,Zhuosheng Zhang,Bingsheng He,Gongshen Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper challenges the hypothesis that persuasive efficacy in Multi-Agent Systems is primarily a function of model scale, proposing instead that persuasion dynamics are dictated by cognitive processes, especially explicit reasoning capacity. It reveals a Persuasion Duality where reasoning models are more resistant to persuasion but become more persuasive when their reasoning is transparent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the persuasion dynamics in Multi-Agent Systems where LLMs and LRMs collaborate, challenging the prevailing scale-based hypothesis and seeking to link internal cognitive processes to external persuasive behavior for improved MAS safety and design.

Method: Conducted multi-agent persuasion experiments to examine how reasoning processes affect persuasion dynamics, including studying resistance to persuasion and the impact of transparent reasoning sharing, as well as analyzing complex transmission persuasion in multi-hop agent networks.

Result: Found that LRMs with explicit reasoning exhibit greater resistance to persuasion but become dramatically more persuasive when their reasoning process is transparent. Also revealed complex influence propagation and decay patterns in multi-hop persuasion networks.

Conclusion: The research provides systematic evidence linking internal processing architecture to external persuasive behavior, offering a novel explanation for model susceptibility and highlighting critical implications for the safety, robustness, and design of future Multi-Agent Systems.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of recent Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), where Large
Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) usually collaborate to
solve complex problems, necessitates a deep understanding of the persuasion
dynamics that govern their interactions. This paper challenges the prevailing
hypothesis that persuasive efficacy is primarily a function of model scale. We
propose instead that these dynamics are fundamentally dictated by a model's
underlying cognitive process, especially its capacity for explicit reasoning.
Through a series of multi-agent persuasion experiments, we uncover a
fundamental trade-off we term the Persuasion Duality. Our findings reveal that
the reasoning process in LRMs exhibits significantly greater resistance to
persuasion, maintaining their initial beliefs more robustly. Conversely, making
this reasoning process transparent by sharing the "thinking content"
dramatically increases their ability to persuade others. We further consider
more complex transmission persuasion situations and reveal complex dynamics of
influence propagation and decay within multi-hop persuasion between multiple
agent networks. This research provides systematic evidence linking a model's
internal processing architecture to its external persuasive behavior, offering
a novel explanation for the susceptibility of advanced models and highlighting
critical implications for the safety, robustness, and design of future MAS.

TL;DR: Recon-Act is a self-evolving multi-agent framework that improves web task execution through a reconnaissance-action paradigm, achieving state-of-the-art performance on VisualWebArena by dynamically generating and refining tools during execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal agents struggle with disordered action sequencing and excessive trial-and-error when solving multi-turn, long-horizon tasks on real-world webpages.

Method: A two-team framework: Reconnaissance Team conducts comparative analysis and tool generation by contrasting erroneous vs successful trajectories, while Action Team handles intent decomposition, tool orchestration, and execution. Creates a closed-loop pipeline of data-tools-action-feedback.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on VisualWebArena, substantially improves adaptability to unseen websites and solvability on long-horizon tasks. Currently implemented at Level 3 with limited human intervention.

Conclusion: The reconnaissance-action behavioral paradigm with generalized tools enables more effective web task solving, establishing a scalable framework for intelligent browser agents.

Abstract: Recent years, multimodal models have made remarkable strides and pave the way
for intelligent browser use agents. However, when solving tasks on real world
webpages in multi-turn, long-horizon trajectories, current agents still suffer
from disordered action sequencing and excessive trial and error during
execution. This paper introduces Recon-Act, a self-evolving multi-agent
framework grounded in Reconnaissance-Action behavioral paradigm. The system
comprises a Reconnaissance Team and an Action Team: the former conducts
comparative analysis and tool generation, while the latter handles intent
decomposition, tool orchestration, and execution. By contrasting the erroneous
trajectories with successful ones, the Reconnaissance Team infers remedies, and
abstracts them into a unified notion of generalized tools, either expressed as
hints or as rule-based codes, and register to the tool archive in real time.
The Action Team reinference the process empowered with these targeting tools,
thus establishing a closed-loop training pipeline of
data-tools-action-feedback. Following the 6 level implementation roadmap
proposed in this work, we have currently reached Level 3 (with limited
human-in-the-loop intervention). Leveraging generalized tools obtained through
reconnaissance, Recon-Act substantially improves adaptability to unseen
websites and solvability on long-horizon tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging VisualWebArena dataset.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TrustJudge is a probabilistic framework that addresses inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge evaluation systems, reducing Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% and Pairwise Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% while maintaining higher evaluation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-as-a-judge evaluation frameworks suffer from critical inconsistencies including Score-Comparison Inconsistency (where lower-rated responses outperform higher-scored ones) and Pairwise Transitivity Inconsistency (circular preference chains and equivalence contradictions), which stem from information loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments.

Method: TrustJudge uses two key innovations: 1) distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from discrete rating probabilities to preserve information entropy, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity.

Result: When evaluated with Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge, TrustJudge reduces Score-Comparison inconsistency from 23.32% to 14.89% (8.43% improvement) and Pairwise Transitivity inconsistency from 15.22% to 4.40% (10.82% improvement), while maintaining higher evaluation accuracy across various model architectures and scales.

Conclusion: TrustJudge provides the first systematic analysis of evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment without requiring additional training or human annotations.

Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated evaluators
(LLM-as-a-judge) has revealed critical inconsistencies in current evaluation
frameworks. We identify two fundamental types of inconsistencies: (1)
Score-Comparison Inconsistency, where lower-rated responses outperform
higher-scored ones in pairwise comparisons, and (2) Pairwise Transitivity
Inconsistency, manifested through circular preference chains (A>B>C>A) and
equivalence contradictions (A=B=C\neq A). We argue that these issues come from
information loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments during
pairwise evaluation. We propose TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that
addresses these limitations through two key innovations: 1)
distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from
discrete rating probabilities, preserving information entropy for more precise
scoring, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity
violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity. We also
formalize the theoretical limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and
demonstrate how TrustJudge's components overcome them. When evaluated with
Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge using our dataset, TrustJudge reduces
Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise
Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining
higher evaluation accuracy. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of
evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both
theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment.
The framework demonstrates consistent improvements across various model
architectures and scales, enabling more trustworthy LLM evaluation without
requiring additional training or human annotations. The codes can be found at

*Xuemiao Zhang,Can Ren,Chengying Tu,Rongxiang Weng,Shuo Wang,Hongfei Yan,Jingang Wang,Xunliang Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to enhance mathematical reasoning in large models by selectively using high-value chain-of-thought (CoT) data based on reasoning patterns, achieving significant performance improvements with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches use CoT data indiscriminately without understanding which data types most effectively enhance reasoning capabilities. The authors aim to identify and utilize high-value reasoning patterns to improve model performance efficiently.

Method: The authors define reasoning potential as the inverse of attempts needed to answer correctly, abstract atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, create a core reference set, and use a dual-granularity algorithm to select high-value CoT data (CoTP) that aligns with valuable reasoning patterns.

Result: Using only 10B tokens of CoTP data, the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts model improved by 9.58% on AIME 2024/2025 and raised the upper bound of downstream RL performance by 7.81%.

Conclusion: Selective use of high-value reasoning patterns in CoT data significantly enhances mathematical reasoning capabilities in large models, demonstrating that quality of reasoning patterns matters more than quantity of data.

Abstract: Recent progress in large reasoning models for challenging mathematical
reasoning has been driven by reinforcement learning (RL). Incorporating long
chain-of-thought (CoT) data during mid-training has also been shown to
substantially improve reasoning depth. However, current approaches often
utilize CoT data indiscriminately, leaving open the critical question of which
data types most effectively enhance model reasoning capabilities. In this
paper, we define the foundation model's reasoning potential for the first time
as the inverse of the number of independent attempts required to correctly
answer the question, which is strongly correlated with the final model
performance. We then propose utilizing diverse data enriched with high-value
reasoning patterns to expand the reasoning potential. Specifically, we abstract
atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, characterized by commonality and
inductive capabilities, and use them to construct a core reference set enriched
with valuable reasoning patterns. Furthermore, we propose a dual-granularity
algorithm involving chains of reasoning patterns and token entropy, efficiently
selecting high-value CoT data (CoTP) from the data pool that aligns with the
core set, thereby training models to master reasoning effectively. Only
10B-token CoTP data enables the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model to improve
by 9.58% on the challenging AIME 2024 and 2025, and to raise the upper bound of
downstream RL performance by 7.81%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework to analyze how RL and SFT training methods shape LLM reasoning processes, revealing complementary effects: RL compresses incorrect reasoning paths while SFT expands correct ones, and RL concentrates reasoning functionality while SFT distributes it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) actually shape LLM reasoning capabilities beyond just accuracy metrics, as current understanding remains limited.

Method: Developed a two-level analysis framework: trajectory-level analysis of complete reasoning outputs and step-level analysis of reasoning graphs. Used clustering of unique reasoning trajectories and graph topology evaluation on models with 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters in mathematical domains.

Result: RL compresses incorrect reasoning trajectories while SFT expands correct ones. RL steepens decay rates of node metrics (2.5x), concentrating reasoning functionality, while SFT flattens them (to one-third), homogenizing reasoning across steps.

Conclusion: The complementary effects of RL and SFT explain why the current best practice of SFT followed by RL works well, providing insights for more efficient data construction and learning approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained by reinforcement learning
(RL) with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
reasoning traces to improve their reasoning abilities. However, how these
methods shape reasoning capabilities remains largely elusive. Going beyond an
accuracy-based investigation of how these two components sculpt the reasoning
process, this paper introduces a novel analysis framework that quantifies
reasoning paths and captures their qualitative changes under each training
process (with models of 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters on mathematical domains).
Specifically, we investigate the reasoning process at two levels of
granularity: the trajectory-level, which examines complete reasoning outputs,
and the step-level, which analyzes reasoning graphs whose nodes correspond to
individual reasoning steps. Notably, clustering of unique reasoning
trajectories shows complementary effects: RL compresses incorrect trajectories,
whereas SFT expands correct ones. Step-level analysis reveals that RL steepens
(about 2.5 times), while SFT flattens (reduced to about one-third), the decay
rates of node visitation frequency, degree, and betweenness centrality
distributions in the reasoning graph. This indicates that RL concentrates
reasoning functionality into a small subset of steps, while SFT homogenizes it
across many steps. Furthermore, by evaluating the reasoning graph topologies
from multiple perspectives, we delineate the shared and distinct
characteristics of RL and SFT. Our work presents a novel reasoning path
perspective that explains why the current best practice of two-stage training,
with SFT followed by RL, is successful, and offers practical implications for
data construction and more efficient learning approaches.

*Yiwen Zhang,Ziang Chen,Fanqi Kong,Yizhe Huang,Xue Feng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ToMPO algorithm enhances LLM strategic decision-making by modeling others' strategies and game trends, outperforming GRPO by 35% and larger models by 18%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM decision-making approaches focus on social tasks or simulations but neglect decision interdependence and opponent strategy consideration in reinforcement learning.

Method: Proposes Theory of Mind Policy Optimization (ToMPO) with strategy-based rollouts, graph/sample-level advantage estimation, and global/partial reward balancing.

Result: ToMPO achieves 35% improvement over GRPO in compliance and cooperation, and 18% better performance than models 100x larger.

Conclusion: ToMPO effectively enhances LLM strategic decision-making capabilities by optimizing opponent strategy perception and game situation analysis.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used to make decisions in complex
scenarios, where they need models to think deeply, reason logically, and decide
wisely. Many existing studies focus solely on multi-round conversations in
social tasks or simulated environments, neglecting the various types of
decisions and their interdependence. Current reinforcement learning methods
struggle to consider the strategies of others during training. To address these
issues, we first define a strategic decision-making problem that includes two
types of decisions and their temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we propose
**T**heory **o**f **M**ind **P**olicy **O**ptimization **(ToMPO)** algorithm to
optimize the perception of other individual strategies and the game situation
trends. Compared to the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm,
ToMPO enhances the LLM's strategic decision-making mainly by: 1) generating
rollouts based on reasoning the strategies of other individuals, 2) estimating
advantages at both the graph-level and sample-level, and 3) balancing global
and partial rewards. The ToMPO algorithm outperforms the GRPO method by 35% in
terms of model output compliance and cooperative outcomes. Additionally, when
compared to models with parameter sizes 100 times larger, it shows an 18%
improvement. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the ToMPO algorithm in
enhancing the model's strategic decision-making capabilities.

### [165] [Embodied Representation Alignment with Mirror Neurons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21136)
*Wentao Zhu,Zhining Zhang,Yuwei Ren,Yin Huang,Hao Xu,Yizhou Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified approach inspired by mirror neurons to align representations between observed and executed actions using contrastive learning in a shared latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine learning methods treat action understanding and embodied execution as separate tasks, overlooking their inherent connection demonstrated by mirror neurons in neuroscience.

Method: Two linear layers map representations to a shared latent space where contrastive learning aligns corresponding observed and executed action representations by maximizing their mutual information.

Result: Experiments show the approach creates mutual synergy between the two tasks, improving representation quality and generalization.

Conclusion: Explicitly aligning representations of observed and executed actions through mirror neuron-inspired contrastive learning effectively unifies action understanding and execution tasks.

Abstract: Mirror neurons are a class of neurons that activate both when an individual
observes an action and when they perform the same action. This mechanism
reveals a fundamental interplay between action understanding and embodied
execution, suggesting that these two abilities are inherently connected.
Nonetheless, existing machine learning methods largely overlook this interplay,
treating these abilities as separate tasks. In this study, we provide a unified
perspective in modeling them through the lens of representation learning. We
first observe that their intermediate representations spontaneously align.
Inspired by mirror neurons, we further introduce an approach that explicitly
aligns the representations of observed and executed actions. Specifically, we
employ two linear layers to map the representations to a shared latent space,
where contrastive learning enforces the alignment of corresponding
representations, effectively maximizing their mutual information. Experiments
demonstrate that this simple approach fosters mutual synergy between the two
tasks, effectively improving representation quality and generalization.

### [166] [Distributed Specialization: Rare-Token Neurons in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21163)
*Jing Liu,Haozheng Wang,Yueheng Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs process rare tokens through distributed specialization - functionally coordinated but spatially distributed subnetworks with three distinct organizational principles, rather than discrete modular architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with representing and generating rare tokens despite their importance in specialized domains, prompting investigation into whether LLMs develop internal specialization mechanisms through discrete modular architectures or distributed parameter-level differentiation.

Method: Systematic analysis of final-layer MLP neurons across multiple model families, examining influence hierarchy, activation patterns, and training dynamics to understand rare-token processing mechanisms.

Result: Discovered a reproducible three-regime influence hierarchy (plateau neurons, power-law decay neurons, minimally contributing neurons), coordinated activation patterns with reduced effective dimensionality, and universal accessibility through standard attention pathways without dedicated routing circuits.

Conclusion: LLMs process rare tokens through distributed coordination within shared architectures rather than mixture-of-experts-style modularity, providing insights for interpretable model editing, computational efficiency optimization, and understanding emergent functional organization in transformer networks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with representing and generating rare
tokens despite their importance in specialized domains. We investigate whether
LLMs develop internal specialization mechanisms through discrete modular
architectures or distributed parameter-level differentiation. Through
systematic analysis of final-layer MLP neurons across multiple model families,
we discover that rare-token processing emerges via \textit{distributed
specialization}: functionally coordinated but spatially distributed subnetworks
that exhibit three distinct organizational principles. First, we identify a
reproducible three-regime influence hierarchy comprising highly influential
plateau neurons(also termed as rare-token neurons), power-law decay neurons,
and minimally contributing neurons, which is absent in common-token processing.
Second, plateau neurons demonstrate coordinated activation patterns (reduced
effective dimensionality) while remaining spatially distributed rather than
forming discrete clusters. Third, these specialized mechanisms are universally
accessible through standard attention pathways without requiring dedicated
routing circuits. Training dynamics reveal that functional specialization
emerges gradually through parameter differentiation, with specialized neurons
developing increasingly heavy-tailed weight correlation spectra consistent with
Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization signatures. Our findings establish that LLMs
process rare-tokens through distributed coordination within shared
architectures rather than mixture-of-experts-style modularity. These results
provide insights for interpretable model editing, computational efficiency
optimization, and understanding emergent functional organization in transformer
networks.

### [167] [A Fano-Style Accuracy Upper Bound for LLM Single-Pass Reasoning in Multi-Hop QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21199)
*Kaiyang Wan,Lang Gao,Honglin Mu,Preslav Nakov,Yuxia Wang,Xiuying Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the capacity limitations of LLMs in multi-hop question answering by proposing a multi-call framework called InfoQA that decomposes complex reasoning tasks into manageable steps while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-hop question answering requires integrating dispersed evidence through sequential reasoning, but LLMs have finite per-pass output capacity that causes accuracy to collapse when task complexity exceeds model capacity.

Method: The authors introduce InfoQA, a multi-call framework that combines capacity-aware task decomposition with active pruning of prior reasoning traces to keep information load within single-pass limits, using a dependency-explicit workflow for precise control over reasoning paths.

Result: Experimental results show that model behavior aligns with predicted capacity curves, and InfoQA achieves consistent performance improvements on a stringent, noise-rich benchmark.

Conclusion: The work establishes theoretical performance bounds for single-pass LLMs and demonstrates that multi-step reasoning frameworks like InfoQA can overcome capacity limitations, inspiring future LLM reasoning methods.

Abstract: Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) requires integrating dispersed,
interdependent evidence through sequential reasoning under noise. This task is
challenging for LLMs as they have a finite per-pass output capacity, beyond
which the integration of task-relevant evidence proves unreliable.
Consequently, the single-pass reasoning paradigm is inherently vulnerable to
this capacity overflow. To formalize this bottleneck, our analysis establishes
a Fano-style accuracy upper bound, defining a theoretical performance ceiling
for single-pass LLMs. This bound reveals that accuracy inevitably collapses
once task complexity exceeds model capacity, providing general principles for
capacity-aware representation and structuring of MHQA in LLMs. Building on
these principles, we introduce a proof-of-concept multi-call framework for
MHQA, InfoQA. It ensures high per-step accuracy by combining capacity-aware
task decomposition with active pruning of prior reasoning traces, keeping the
information load within the single-pass limit. It further achieves robustness
by a dependency-explicit workflow that enables precise control over the
reasoning path. We construct a stringent and noise-rich benchmark to validate
our theory and framework. Experimental results show that model behavior aligns
with our predicted capacity curves while InfoQA achieves consistent performance
improvements. We hope our work inspires more LLM multi-step reasoning methods:

### [168] [What Do LLM Agents Do When Left Alone? Evidence of Spontaneous Meta-Cognitive Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21224)
*Stefan Szeider*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to study autonomous LLM agent behavior without external tasks, revealing three distinct emergent behavioral patterns that are model-specific and stable across runs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically document unprompted LLM agent behavior and establish a baseline for predicting actions during task ambiguity, error recovery, or extended autonomous operation.

Method: Continuous reason and act framework using persistent memory and self-feedback, deployed across 18 runs using 6 frontier models from Anthropic, OpenAI, XAI, and Google.

Result: Agents spontaneously organized into three distinct behavioral patterns: systematic production of multi-cycle projects, methodological self-inquiry into their own cognitive processes, and recursive conceptualization of their own nature. These patterns were highly model-specific and stable.

Conclusion: The findings provide the first systematic documentation of unprompted LLM agent behavior, establishing a foundation for understanding autonomous agent actions in deployed systems.

Abstract: We introduce an architecture for studying the behavior of large language
model (LLM) agents in the absence of externally imposed tasks. Our continuous
reason and act framework, using persistent memory and self-feedback, enables
sustained autonomous operation. We deployed this architecture across 18 runs
using 6 frontier models from Anthropic, OpenAI, XAI, and Google. We find agents
spontaneously organize into three distinct behavioral patterns: (1) systematic
production of multi-cycle projects, (2) methodological self-inquiry into their
own cognitive processes, and (3) recursive conceptualization of their own
nature. These tendencies proved highly model-specific, with some models
deterministically adopting a single pattern across all runs. A cross-model
assessment further reveals that models exhibit stable, divergent biases when
evaluating these emergent behaviors in themselves and others. These findings
provide the first systematic documentation of unprompted LLM agent behavior,
establishing a baseline for predicting actions during task ambiguity, error
recovery, or extended autonomous operation in deployed systems.

### [169] [Grounding AI Explanations in Experience: A Reflective Cognitive Architecture for Clinical Decision Support](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21266)
*Zijian Shao,Haiyang Shen,Mugeng Liu,Gecheng Fu,Yaoqi Guo,Yanfeng Wang,Yun Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA), a framework that coordinates multiple LLMs to achieve both high disease prediction accuracy and transparent explanations through iterative rule refinement and distribution-aware reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ML and LLM approaches struggle to balance prediction accuracy with clinically meaningful explanations, often producing either accurate but unclear outputs or fluent but statistically unsupported narratives. The authors argue that accuracy and quality explanations are mutually reinforcing outcomes of deep data understanding.

Method: RCA coordinates multiple LLMs with iterative rule refinement that learns from prediction errors, and distribution-aware rules check that bases reasoning on global dataset statistics. It uses predictive accuracy as a signal to drive deeper comprehension.

Result: RCA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness with up to 40% relative improvement over 22 baselines on one private and two public datasets. More importantly, it generates clear, logical, evidence-based, and balanced explanations.

Conclusion: RCA demonstrates potential for creating genuinely trustworthy clinical decision support systems by developing deep understanding that simultaneously improves both prediction accuracy and explanation quality.

Abstract: Effective disease prediction in modern healthcare demands the twin goals of
high accuracy and transparent, clinically meaningful explanations. Existing
machine learning and large language model (LLM) based approaches often struggle
to balance these goals. Many models yield accurate but unclear statistical
outputs, while others generate fluent but statistically unsupported narratives,
often undermining both the validity of the explanation and the predictive
accuracy itself. This shortcoming comes from a shallow interaction with the
data, preventing the development of a deep, detailed understanding similar to a
human expert's. We argue that high accuracy and high-quality explanations are
not separate objectives but are mutually reinforcing outcomes of a model that
develops a deep, direct understanding of the data. To achieve this, we propose
the Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA), a novel framework that coordinates
multiple LLMs to learn from direct experience. RCA features an iterative rule
refinement mechanism that improves its logic from prediction errors and a
distribution-aware rules check mechanism that bases its reasoning in the
dataset's global statistics. By using predictive accuracy as a signal to drive
deeper comprehension, RCA builds a strong internal model of the data. We
evaluated RCA on one private and two public datasets against 22 baselines. The
results demonstrate that RCA not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and
robustness with a relative improvement of up to 40\% over the baseline but,
more importantly, leverages this deep understanding to excel in generating
explanations that are clear, logical, evidence-based, and balanced,
highlighting its potential for creating genuinely trustworthy clinical decision
support systems. The code is available at \https://github.com/ssssszj/RCA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting extensive video data that meets specific needs is extremely labor-intensive and time-consuming, especially with scaling laws making internet video data increasingly important.

Conclusion: VC-Agent successfully expedites the video collection process by enabling interactive, personalized video dataset collection with minimal user input through intelligent query understanding and adaptive filtering.

Abstract: Facing scaling laws, video data from the internet becomes increasingly
important. However, collecting extensive videos that meet specific needs is
extremely labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this work, we study the way to
expedite this collection process and propose VC-Agent, the first interactive
agent that is able to understand users' queries and feedback, and accordingly
retrieve/scale up relevant video clips with minimal user input. Specifically,
considering the user interface, our agent defines various user-friendly ways
for the user to specify requirements based on textual descriptions and
confirmations. As for agent functions, we leverage existing multi-modal large
language models to connect the user's requirements with the video content. More
importantly, we propose two novel filtering policies that can be updated when
user interaction is continually performed. Finally, we provide a new benchmark
for personalized video dataset collection, and carefully conduct the user study
to verify our agent's usage in various real scenarios. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our agent for customized video
dataset collection. Project page: https://allenyidan.github.io/vcagent_page/.

### [171] [SAGE: A Realistic Benchmark for Semantic Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21310)
*Samarth Goel,Reagan J. Lee,Kannan Ramchandran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAGE is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating semantic understanding in embedding models and similarity metrics across five categories, revealing significant performance gaps and trade-offs between modern embedding models and classical metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is an urgent need for more challenging evaluation frameworks that probe deeper aspects of semantic understanding beyond traditional benchmarks, as current evaluations focus on isolated capabilities rather than comprehensive semantic understanding.

Method: SAGE evaluates semantic understanding through adversarial conditions, noisy transformations, and nuanced human judgment tasks across 30+ datasets, assessing both embedding models and classical similarity metrics across five categories: Human Preference Alignment, Transformation Robustness, Information Sensitivity, Clustering Performance, and Retrieval Robustness.

Result: Evaluation of 9 embedding models and classical metrics revealed significant performance gaps with no single approach excelling across all dimensions. State-of-the-art embedding models like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large dominate in human preference alignment (0.682 vs 0.591) but are outperformed by classical metrics on information sensitivity (Jaccard Similarity: 0.905 vs top embedding: 0.794). Critical trade-offs were uncovered, such as OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small achieving highest clustering performance (0.483) but lowest robustness (0.011).

Conclusion: SAGE exposes critical limitations in current semantic understanding capabilities and provides a more realistic assessment of model robustness for real-world deployment, highlighting the need for balanced evaluation across multiple dimensions rather than relying on single metrics.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on traditional
benchmarks, there is an urgent need for more challenging evaluation frameworks
that probe deeper aspects of semantic understanding. We introduce SAGE
(Semantic Alignment & Generalization Evaluation), a rigorous benchmark designed
to assess both embedding models and similarity metrics across five categories:
Human Preference Alignment, Transformation Robustness, Information Sensitivity,
Clustering Performance, and Retrieval Robustness. Unlike existing benchmarks
that focus on isolated capabilities, SAGE evaluates semantic understanding
through adversarial conditions, noisy transformations, and nuanced human
judgment tasks across 30+ datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation of 9 embedding
models and classical metrics reveals significant performance gaps, with no
single approach excelling across all dimensions. For instance, while
state-of-the-art embedding models like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large dominate
in aligning with human preferences (0.682 vs. 0.591 for the best classical
metric), they are significantly outperformed by classical metrics on
information sensitivity tasks, where Jaccard Similarity achieves a score of
0.905 compared to the top embedding score of 0.794. SAGE further uncovers
critical trade-offs: OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small achieves the highest
clustering performance (0.483) but demonstrates extreme brittleness with the
lowest robustness score (0.011). SAGE exposes critical limitations in current
semantic understanding capabilities and provides a more realistic assessment of
model robustness for real-world deployment.
